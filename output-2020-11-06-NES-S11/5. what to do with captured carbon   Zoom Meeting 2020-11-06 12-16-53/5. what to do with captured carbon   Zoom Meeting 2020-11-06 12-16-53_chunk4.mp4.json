            "transcript": "From communicating with those groups and knowing their technologies a little bit, one of the issues is this starting concentration of CO2 and how that impacts the conversion efficiency to the chemicals or the fuels. In the case of Opus 12, their new business model is really focused on actually just making syngas just for flexibility and being able to make different maybe it's oxalic acid that they want to make or maybe it's even synthetic methane for instance. Lots of flexibility based upon their approach depending on the catalyst that they're using. But one of the questions is like, what is the essential CO2 concentration going into your process and how does that impact the conversion efficiency? And then from a chemical engineering perspective, how does that impact the size of the reactor and then obviously the CAPEX of the system? Because how low can you go in terms of CO2 concentration as a feedstock? That could be a tunable parameter that could impact costs. I don't know if you guys have given any thought to that.",

But it's like imagine if you could get away with 40% CO2 concentration in nitrogen. Like, how does that impact the conversion efficiency of your process? Whether it's probably not having to do with the actual reaction kinetics, but more the diffusion kinetics, like what you're saying, Martha. But I think that that, you know, we often work in our silos and what we're trying to do here is like break those walls down and get us working, you know, across those sectors.",

So one of the things that it's known to be able to do is help to bring the magnesium out of, you know, so if you have a mine tailing waste, you know, and it's got magnesium in it. Often sometimes the magnesium isn't necessarily reactive because it's bound in a silica structure and it's very difficult to get it out. But when you add oxylate or oxalic acid to the solution, it actually helps to dissolve the magnesium and make it reactive for crystallization or mineralization with CO2. And so one of the things like Opus 12 was looking at is working with a company called Solidia. And so very different, but looking at Solidia's process, I don't know if you guys know, Solidia is a company where they make low carbon concrete ultimately. And so one process in which they do that is instead of curing with water, they cure with CO2. And it turns out that if you add oxalic acid in that process, you enhance the uptake of CO2 through the curing process. And so really it's like, you know, that acid allows the magnesium atoms in your feedstock, if it's a mineralization approach, to be more reactive to CO2 and to help bind it. But it would be towards a permanent product, not necessarily like a feedstock like you wouldn't use it as a fuel. You would use it as a part of an enhancement process for mineralizing CO2. So that that's how I see it.",
