            "transcript": "Based on my understanding of the ways in which we can convert CO2, I know there's a huge push towards electrochemistry because that's one sustainable way of leveraging solar and wind to convert to electricity and then use that towards reducing CO2. One of the things that is kind of less explored, at least based on my understanding, is using light directly. So one of the things that you can achieve with light, which is difficult to achieve in an electrochemical process, is the one electron reduction of CO2. When you talk about electrochemistry, you're talking about two or more electron reduction of CO2, right? Because one electron has a very, very high overpotential associated with it. So those kind of reductions can be achieved using photoredox chemistry. So essentially using light to drive a photoredox catalyst to become an anion and that anion can push one electron towards CO2. And as far as I understand it, there are operational issues associated with it, which is why as of right now, it's mostly focused on highly specific applications. It could either be things like adding COH groups to aromatics. So basically carboxylates styrene and make a polymer precursor, attach a carboxylic acid to an amine and make an amino acid which can go into pharmaceuticals. So there are a lot of specialized applications that we can think of. The challenge, of course, being making sure that these catalysts are cyclable and coming up with continuous processes. But at least there are lab scale continuous processes that exist now that leverage these light assisted pathways. So I think we can do more difficult chemistry as well beyond what is shown with electrocatalysis. And we can think beyond formic acid, right? Because you can use any kind of substrate and link a carboxylate group to it.",

            "transcript": "Yeah. So one of the issues that I see with some of the catalysts that we look at is the cyclability. Because you're using light, in addition to doing the photoredox chemistry, these molecules tend to degrade rather rapidly. So you get five turnovers and everything dies out. And this is, and the issues that I think are kind of common between the materials used for catalysis and the materials we use for organic LEDs, for example. So I think there is a lot of opportunity in trying to identify what those degradation pathways are and finding ways to mitigate them. And then that has applications across all kinds of light, all kinds of photonic materials, not just photoredox chemistry.",
