Because the chemical industry, if you look at the market for formic acid, it's really small, okay? The market price is pretty high, but the market size is too small. It's not even close to the CO2 size. All those magnitude away. So, if you think of formic acid covering with the one just mentioned, formic acid fuel cell, we think formic acid as a fuel rather than a chemical. So there's a significant difference here. We think of this as the waste for energy storage rather than for chemical production. Then you will get to a much larger scale. I think that's the way to go to store energy in the chemical bonds with some kind of chemicals like formic acid is relatively easy to store rather than think about hydrogen has this headache. You know, storage is always a challenge there or transportation is always a challenge there. I think formic acid could be a unique one to play an important role for chemical or for energy storage.",

There's a wealth of literature on organic synthesis where you can think of CO2 as a feedstock for carboxylation reactions of anything to produce anything from specialty chemicals to pharmaceutical ingredients. And there's a mix of pathways to be able to do that, either using like any synthetic organic chemistry or or photo redox pathways where you have these nice organic or inorganic photo redox catalysts that either in their excited states or in some sort of anion radical states can reduce CO2 and and help carboxylate things like styrene carboxylation, amino acid formation. So I think there are a lot of little niche applications that we can come up with based on on the chemical knowledge that we already have.",

If you look at the battery publication, the Google paper they can up to, you know, several months test. And how can, you know, even at lab scale, if you can damage, you know, reliable catalyst for, you know, hundreds hours, it will make, you know, index adoption more optimistic and realistic for them to get involved. If you only do, you know, 10 hours test, 24 hours test, I'm not sure industry will be really interested to get into the business. So that's that's the reason I brought these out. Because eventually, so no matter you negative, you know, emission or CO2 neutral conversion. So you want something end up with possibility for scale up, right?

So so then I go back to the idea of if you have a transportable direct air capture unit, you can transport it to a place that has mining tailings. And some mining tailings actually exist right beside an industry still emitting CO2. So then they might make sense to more again use the CO2 from the flue gas. But a lot of mining tailings are in old mining sites where there's nothing anymore there. There are cities which even don't exist anymore and the mining tailings are still there. So you could take your direct capture there, unit there, capture CO2 and then inject it into the mining tailings to then do mineral carbonation of the mining tailings. Right? So this is a well accepted idea. Many people in Canada, Australia, so on, work on this, but they usually assume that they're getting the CO2 directly from the air. But if we can capture the CO2 and concentrate it, then we're going to be weathering those tailings a lot faster and maybe even more than just by by waiting for the the air to do it. So so that would be large scale potential application.",

But these are, you know, they've they've kind of changed their business model over the years. But for the most part, looking at low cost electricity in the United States, like where could that be sourced and low cost CO2. So they originally thinking about direct air capture just because of the flexibility of the sighting as Raphael is pointing out. But just because it's so high cost, you know, it's a matter of, okay, maybe we start with point source capture.
