            "transcript": "Okay, I do have a project currently funded by the UW on formic acid. The thought there is not really targeted the chemical industry site. Because the chemical industry, if you look at the market for formic acid, it's really small, okay? The market price is pretty high, but the market size is too small. It's not even close to the CO2 size, not all those magnitude away. So, if you think of formic acid comparing with the one just mentioned, formic acid fuel cell, we think formic acid as a fuel rather than a chemical. So there's a significant difference here. We think of this as the waste for energy storage rather than for chemical production. Then you will get to a much larger scale. I think that's the way to go to store energy in the chemical bonds with some kind of chemicals like formic acid is relatively easy to store rather than think about hydrogen has this headache. You know, storage is always a challenge there or transportation is always a challenge there. I think formic acid could be a unique one to play an important role for chemical or for energy storage.",

And so I don't know like, you know, what's like, should I put it in the slide or how are we feeling about this?",

There's a wealth of literature on organic synthesis where you can think of CO2 as a feed stock for carboxylation reactions of anything to produce anything from specialty chemicals to pharmaceutical ingredients. And there's a mix of pathways to be able to do that either using like any synthetic organic chemistry or or photo redox pathways where you have these nice organic or inorganic photo redox catalysts that either in their excited states or in some sort of anion radical states can reduce CO2 and and help carboxylate things like styrene carboxylation, amino acid formation.",
