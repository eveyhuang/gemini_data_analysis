            "transcript": "So if it's in a depleted oil and gas reservoir, the CO2 trapping mechanism is really the same as what's been trapping the oil and gas for millions of years. And so the likelihood of it leaking back out is pretty negligible. Um, we've been doing projects like that in the Permian Basin in Texas since 1972 and there's been zero leakage and zero accidents of CO2. So it's pretty good. But at the same time, those are the projects that are such controversial topics because they also as Fang said, like that's not the answer. Uh, you're releasing, you know, more CO2 in the form of burning crude oil in the end. And so if there were opportunity, but it doesn't mean you can't use depleted oil and gas wells to store CO2. It's just that can we do that and not take more oil out of the ground because those formations are really appropriate for carbon storage. The saline aquifers are another option, but the difference is is we have to characterize them better, we have to know more about them because they don't necessarily have say a low permeability cap rock that will keep the CO2 physically trapped initially. Um, so they just require a lot more characterization. Yeah. And and people, I think a big part of this is just public acceptance and whether or not every culture or community is comfortable with the idea of putting carbon dioxide, you know, underground in their backyard. And I think that that's another issue.",
