And it's just the cost issue, right? So I think the cost you can think a different way. If you don't put any any cost to CO2 emission, of course, you will say, yeah, that hydrogen from water electrolysis is just too expensive. But if you think differently, say CO2 emission actually has a cost, right? to the environment. And someone else need to pay for it, okay? It's not free. So if you take that into account, I think water electrolysis is is the way to go. You can do biomass to take up hydrogen. I think these could be short term kind of route to do to consider. But in a long term, um if you think about once you take the hydrogen out, you end with CO2. How you dealing with those things?",
