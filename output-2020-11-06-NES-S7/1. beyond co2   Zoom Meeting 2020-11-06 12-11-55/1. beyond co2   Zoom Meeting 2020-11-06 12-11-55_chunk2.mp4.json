            "transcript": "Dual zooming during our break yesterday, and we had a seminar speaker from Johnson Matthew. They're talking about even for hydrogen. But as a mechanism for hydrogen storage, there is a significant push actually to convert electrochemically produced hydrogen, thermally convert it to ammonia for more easy transportation, and then thermal catalytically convert it back to hydrogen for the use. Now, there can be arguments can be made about whether that's useful or whether you would just want to use the ammonia once you've had it. But I'm kind of then looking at the economics of that sort of a process. Is it worth also an electro investigating an electrochemical route to ammonia production if this thermal route is is really so efficient that you can go back and forth simply as a means for more facile transportation even at scale.",

Those numbers that you just cited benefit hugely from the economy of scale and being able to have these energy recovery for the thermal recovery especially. So if you want to have a distributed network where nitrogen is obviously a distributed resource. Can you capitalize on that with such efficiencies?",

            "transcript": "I can add something here for of course for the energy input from renewable electricity to reduce nitrogen to ammonia is a very attractive route. But still starting from how to say maybe 20 10 years ago, there is a big wave coming in doing this nitrogen reduction to ammonia. But the more published papers we see, but there comes out a big problem is the let's say it's like called the false positive signals coming from this result. That concerns a lot, not only my own research, but a lot of my friends inside the field, we have the concerns about how to repeat others results. It's because the current density nowadays we can do under the room temperature to reduce nitrogen is very, very small. It's less than maybe 0.1 milliamp. There is some report is 1 milliamp or even more. But it is really difficult for for people to repeat. This is also another consideration as Marcel has already mentioned the harbor Bosch, maybe, you know, several orders of magnitudes higher energy efficiency than using the electricity to reduce nitrogen to ammonia. Is that possible or it doesn't make sense for us to sacrifice some of the energy efficiencies to convert nitrogen to reduce nitrogen to ammonia or we improve the water splitting efficiency to generate the hydrogen we need and go through the harbor Bosch process to get the ammonia we need. That needs to be debated actually if at least at this current stage. But it's still open discussions like in the future we probably will get a very good catalyst to to add room temperature to reduce nitrogen to ammonia. That's that's also very possible.",

            "transcript": "I just like to add from a different perspective because I don't work on reactions, but more separations, is that there's a lot of interest I've seen from doing the reaction for nitrogen conversion from nitrates. And I think from a separation perspective, there is a advantage there is because you can recover waste nitrate of concentrated electrochemically and they use it for upcycling. So there's a lot of interesting electrochemical challenges in the nitrogen product and precursor separation that maybe when integrated with the reactions might make the overall system more efficient just because you can have one happening at the cathode, the other at the anode. So you have full integration. But I don't know how that fits into the whole energetics. I think from an electrochemical separation perspective, there's all sorts of sustainability and chemical consumption advantages.",

And the role is to sustain enhanced biological production that will draw down extra carbon dioxide. So I think there, you know, there's really good reason to question is that the best route to go, you know, how much carbon dioxide, how much additional carbon dioxide can you capture? What are the co-benefits of doing so? What are the disbenefits, like the extra consumption of say fresh water and nutrients on land? And then also, what's the degree of permanence? Like, you know, I live in California, a lot of our natural carbon a lot of our natural climate solutions just went up in flames in the last few months. And so when we're thinking about this role of nitrogen, um it's probably worth zooming out and thinking about, you know, what's the end fate of that nitrogen?",

            "transcript": "I would like to add to this. I think another role that actually ammonia can place as an energy carrier. I think it's it's a fairly elegant energy carrier. We can store it. Okay. Ammonia is a bit toxic. That's kind of the problem. On the other end, um we can actually liquefy it at reasonable temperatures, reasonable pressures. So it is a fairly good energy carrier. We can essentially attach hydrogen atoms to nitrogen, shuffle them around and and use them like Lindsay said. I think that's just something that we might also want to kind of keep in in view. It could be a very green, sustainable and thus reduce the carbon generation at least. It's not a carbon negative, so that's it's not a negative emission. It's a neutral emission technology.",

So as mentioned, there are many experiments about nitrogen reduction to ammonium, which cannot be reproduced by other groups. And that's actually challenging for any needs for computational chemist like me because I try to for example, if I say a paper published for example in nature or science reporting very high performance for the catalytic and to reduction to ammonium. Then I would like to follow up with this experiment trying to understand why this catalyst is so good. What's what is the fundamental mechanism underlying this catalyst? But it turns out after sometime, this paper, I mean, cannot be reproduced. Some people are saying their experiments are not done carefully. So, so if I want to follow those papers, then I would, you know, waste some time trying to study something which is actually not experimentally verified. So I think, uh, yeah, it's very important to get clean experiments, reproducible experiments as a basis for computational studies.",
