Now, there can be arguments can be made about whether that's useful or whether you would just want to use the ammonia once you've had it.

But the more published papers we see, but there comes out a big problem is the let's say it's like called the false positive signals coming from this result. That concerns a lot, not only my own research, but a lot of my friends inside the field, we have the concerns about how to repeat others results. It's because the current density nowadays we can do under the room temperature to reduce nitrogen is very, very small. It's less than maybe 0.1 milliamp. There is some report is 1 milliamp or even more. But it is really difficult for for people to repeat. This is also another consideration as Marcel has already mentioned the harbor Bosch, maybe, you know, several orders of magnitudes higher energy efficiency than using the electricity to reduce nitrogen to ammonia. Is that possible or it doesn't make sense for us to sacrifice some of the energy efficiencies to convert nitrogen to reduce nitrogen to ammonia or we improve the water splitting efficiency to generate the hydrogen we need and go through the harbor Bosch process to get the ammonia we need. That needs to be debated actually if at least at this current stage.

So there's a lot of interesting electrochemical challenges in the nitrogen product and precursor separation that maybe when integrated with the reactions might make the overall system more efficient just because you can have one happening at the cathode, the other at the anode.

We need to bring in dinitrogen and we need to bring in protons and we need to bring in current. So we need obviously a kind of triple phase boundary or or kind of a gas diffusion electrode kind of design. This will be very difficult, especially if we're bringing in the gaseous species, which is very weakly soluble. I think that's where people struggle. Whereas if we are generating hydrogen in an electrolyzer, we have no transport problem. We just can bring water to the reaction side with very high transport rates, generate hydrogen, get the gas, and then convert it together with the second gas nitrogen in a in a in a Harbor Bosch process. So I just think when we look at this from this engineering perspective, right? This need for a triple phase boundary compared to the ease of generating hydrogen electrochemically, we may kind of find ourselves in this situation where when we want to do it at scale, we might we may find it hard to compete with the coupled Harbor Bosch and and electrolyzer design.

If you manage start to think about BECCS as a power source as well as a way to produce negative emissions, you're now talking about very distributed CO2 or carbon storage. So that leads me to thinking about a future landscape that has either a massive amount of CO2 pipelines if we're going to sequester CO2 geologically or a massive reliance on biochar and the associated costs with shipping solids around for sequestration. And so I'm just I'm unsure which of those two is is lower hanging fruit and more likely to be attainable in the short term because both from a systems engineering and logistics perspective seem complex to me. But if you look at climate models, there's always a massive amount of BECCS that's suggested as a solution for our negative emissions challenge.
