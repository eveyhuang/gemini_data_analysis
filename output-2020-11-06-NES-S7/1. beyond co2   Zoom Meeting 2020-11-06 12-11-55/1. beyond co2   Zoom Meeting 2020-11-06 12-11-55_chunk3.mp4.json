So I first of all, I don't want to discredit research on nitrogen reduction because I think from a scientific perspective, it's fascinating. This nitrogen dinitrogen bond is fascinating. But when you then look at an engineering perspective, when we think about what we need to do to do an electrochemical transformation of nitrogen. Now we just think at scale, right? We need to bring in dinitrogen and we need to bring in protons and we need to bring in current. So we need obviously a kind of triple phase boundary or or kind of a gas diffusion electrode kind of design. This will be very difficult, especially if we're bringing in the gaseous species, which is very weakly soluble. I think that's where people struggle. Whereas if we are generating hydrogen in an electrolyzer, we have no transport problem. We just can bring water to the reaction side with very high transport rates, generate hydrogen, get the gas, and then convert it together with the second gas nitrogen in a in a in a Harbor Bosch process. So I just think when we look at this from this engineering perspective, right? This need for a triple phase boundary compared to the ease of generating hydrogen electrochemically, we may kind of find ourselves in this situation where when we want to do it at scale, we might we may find it hard to compete with the coupled Harbor Bosch and and electrolyzer design. I don't know what you guys think.",

Like we can take examples from, let's say, oxygen reduction fuel cell. They also need these type of triple phase boundaries, but they can deliver very high current density, which means that you can also deliver very high production rates per area of your electro, right? But the challenge here now is we don't have platinum as efficient in OOR as iron catalyst. We can we can have for NRR. That's I think will be the critical challenge here to deliver the scale that you mentioned to compete with Harbor Bosch.",

And the topic is beyond CO2 and, you know, come up with the craziest idea we can come up with. And, you know, on one hand, from a from a from a chemistry perspective, the nitrogen molecule doesn't have a dipole, so it's really hard to activate for you at a surface, at a molecule, you name it. But on the other hand, you know, I think that there are from from a synthetic perspective, there are a lot of other products that could be made from a nitrogen reduction process. And so, you know, if that is a way to, you know, frame the question not necessarily in terms of replacing Harbor Bosch, which we know that is difficult, but maybe adding a different kind of value to to to a process. And so something that comes to mind is capturing carbon dioxide, converting it to formaldehyde, then making ammonia electrocatalytically, and there are some systems that do this, and then just adding a cyanide source and making amino acids. You know, these are basic building blocks for organic synthesis and pharmaceutical science. And, you know, these discussions today have really kind of catalyzed these ideas where, you know, maybe we just need to think a little bit bigger, right? And, you know, Harbor Bosch is extraordinarily difficult to make an argument against, but maybe there there are other ways to to frame the problem as an opportunity in a different context.",
