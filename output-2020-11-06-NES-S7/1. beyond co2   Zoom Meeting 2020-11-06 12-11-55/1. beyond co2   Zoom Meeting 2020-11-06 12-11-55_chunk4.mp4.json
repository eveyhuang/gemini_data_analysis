But can CO2 be an oxidant to oxidize dinitrogen to form NOx, which then we can process downstream through other means? I know there's a lot of technology in NOx production out there already. So, just a thought to put out there.",

Because if you are activating nitrogen to NO or other types of NOx, it will be much easier to directly reduce to ammonia, much, much easier.",

Uh the problem for hydrogen peroxide production based on these anthraquinone process is that also consumes hydrogen, a lot of the hydrogen. But at the same time, um their energy efficiency is not super high. It's already very good, but it's not as very high because they they they involves a lot of product separation and a lot of organic waste and selectivity over there. And in some recent research, people noticed that the catalyst to drive the oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide seems to be quite easy to find out, much easier than the nitrogen reduction is there are many different types of catalyst that can very selectively reduce oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. And that could be something maybe the hydrogen peroxide market is not as huge as ammonia, right? But to some extent, it might also if we can electrifying the production, it might also help to reduce some CO2 emissions over the course.",

Maybe shall we can you actually No, no, because actually my when I was at MIT, my roommate, he has a company now that makes hydrogen peroxide like bio bio like through bio means.
