Uh, one of which is this kind of spatial resolution of metabolism. And so, you know, a lot of the approaches that we have on the cell biology side in terms of, you know, broad population level metabolomics are not sufficient for a lot of the questions that apparently everyone in this group is is similarly thinking about in terms of the spatial organization in 3D and in a tissue where oxygen gradients, pH gradients, nutrient availability might be very altered. And so this this ability to get it at spatial organization of metabolism within a cell, within tissue, within an organism, I think is is really important and we need to think about the the needs there and then um, you know, I I think it's fascinating that you want subpixel um information there. That is just blows my mind because we can't even get, you know, reasonable dynamic measurements in a single cell sometimes. And so the idea that you could have that kind of of uh resolution is is really interesting to me. Um, but I think coming this connects also to to Kevin's point about heterogeneity and uh at the you know, uh what is the variability that we're interested in and and what is the sensitivity that we need in our measurement tool to be uh confident that we're capturing that variability if it's biologically meaningful. And as as we come at this problem, we see a lot of these correlations at the population level that we're not able to confirm at a single cell level reliably. And so one of the uh questions that maybe we can kind of jump off of where Kevin uh and Lingyan got us started is, you know, what are the constraints there?

For example, the the brain tumor case. So for the brain tumor removal, the surgeon will just take take out the just open the skull and take out the brain tumor and they usually will do assess on that scar wall inside the brain to to see if there is any tumor cell left inside the brain. So the traditional or conventional way is to just take a little very little tiny piece out and do the histology image H and E staining to to check if the cell uh are all brain cells and there is no tumor cells left inside. So then we can close the skull and wake up the patient. But usually it takes the conventional method usually takes too long and maybe a few hours. So the the patient will be under anesthesia for a few hours waiting for the results. But now um since SRS allow us to visualize the protein and the lipids very rapidly. for example I I take like five minutes to take the image when you have that piece of tissue and immediately you have the digital H and E like mimic H and E and the pathologist can look at the H and E image in a few minutes and determine if there is tumor cell left or not. So it saves a few hours and the the patient can be wake up very soon um not they they don't need to be under anesthesia for that that long. So it's kind of protecting the brain. Also it's it's a biopsy. It's a it's a diagnostic biopsy um during the clinical clinical period.
