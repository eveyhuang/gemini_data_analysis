One is the label free including the fluorescence multiphoton fluorescence for example, we look at the NADH or flavor molecules in the living organism. And another layer is the Raman label free approach that we can visualize those lipids and protein information inside the animals and tissues. And we also want to separate the new molecules uh newly synthesized molecule from the older endogenous molecules. So we have been also labeled those metabolites such as using heavy water or labeled glucose amino acids to probe the metabolic activities in the live animals.

Uh, one of which is this kind of spatial resolution of metabolism. And so, you know, a lot of the approaches that we have on the cell biology side in terms of, you know, broad population level metabolomics are not sufficient for a lot of the questions that apparently everyone in this group is is similarly thinking about in terms of the spatial organization in 3D and in a tissue where oxygen gradients, pH gradients, nutrient availability might be very altered. And so this this ability to get it at spatial organization of metabolism within a cell, within tissue, within an organism, I think is is really important and we need to think about the the needs there and then um, you know, I I think it's fascinating that you want subpixel um information there. That is just blows my mind because we can't even get, you know, reasonable dynamic measurements in a single cell sometimes. And so the idea that you could have that kind of of uh resolution is is really interesting to me. Um, but I think coming this connects also to to Kevin's point about heterogeneity and uh at the you know, uh what is the variability that we're interested in and and what is the sensitivity that we need in our measurement tool to be uh confident that we're capturing that variability if it's biologically meaningful. And as as we come at this problem, we see a lot of these correlations at the population level that we're not able to confirm at a single cell level reliably. And so one of the uh questions that maybe we can kind of jump off of where Kevin uh and Lingyan got us started is, you know, what are the constraints there?

        "transcript": "Well, um yes, I think one application it's already uh being conducting in hospital with SRS, the stimulated Raman scattering microscopy is to uh really separate those cancer cell from the normal normal tissue. For example, the the brain tumor case. So for the brain tumor removal, the surgeon will just take take out the just open the skull and take out the brain tumor and they usually will do assess on that scar wall inside the brain to to see if there is any tumor cell left inside the brain. So the traditional or conventional way is to just take a little very little tiny piece out and do the histology image H and E staining to to check if the cell uh are all brain cells and there is no tumor cells left inside. So then we can close the skull and wake up the patient. But usually it takes the conventional method usually takes too long and maybe a few hours. So the the patient will be under anesthesia for a few hours waiting for the results. But now um since SRS allow us to visualize the protein and the lipids very rapidly. for example I I take like five minutes to take the image when you have that piece of tissue and immediately you have the digital H and E like mimic H and E and the pathologist can look at the H and E image in a few minutes and determine if there is tumor cell left or not. So it saves a few hours and the the patient can be wake up very soon um not they they don't need to be under anesthesia for that that long. So it's kind of protecting the brain. Also it's it's a biopsy. It's a it's a diagnostic biopsy um during the clinical clinical period. So I think that types of like fast rapid diagnostic molecular level determination based on the imaging technology such as SRS may uh be helpful. That is just one example.",

Um yeah, it's it's closely related to the glucose metabolism. Uh so um in terms of diabetes um there's there's a very big problem and people trying to solve this problem for 20 years still not successful um because of limited uh special resolution and also the sensitivity we use we have been tried with the MRI mostly and some people tried pad. So that's why people trying to uh combine the pad uh to complement each other to increase the uh sensitivity and the special resolution.

Um, but it is label free, right? We don't have to use a contrast agent, you're using, you know, protons, um, you know, hydrogen nuclei, which is are present in everything. Um, so I think those are the pros, but it's certainly challenging and then you know, on the other side of things the analysis is difficult. So while there's some inline analysis so that you know, a radiologist can sit at the scanner and see peaks and get approximate idea of patterns.

Um the other thing is what out of the prompts that we started with, the idea that metabolic changes proceed physiological changes, I think when we're looking at the brain and and we are using physiological measures of um well what I would call physiological measures, we're using vascular properties to estimate a metabolic property. So the timeline of things is really important when we try to infer one from the other. So in the pathologies, knowing when we can trust our models of how vascular signals relate to metabolism or when those models have already broken down because metabolism wrecks the something about the vascular thing we're measuring. I'm not sure I'm being very coherent, but I feel like it's it's a big challenge that like with a lot of things with this neuro MRI view of metabolism, I feel like we're we're a bit superficial with it so far. With oxymetabolism, not MRS. I am not doing spectroscopy. Just to put that out there. That's a very different thing and much more interpretable.",
