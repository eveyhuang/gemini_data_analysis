You could do phosphorus, um, sodium imaging is used in the heart if you have that system. I mean the big limitation is you have to have your scanner set up to do spectroscopy, so not every clinical site has that. It's possible on every clinical MRI scanner, you just it's a money issue, right? The site had to pay for it in advance.",

So in the brain, water is about a thousand times more concentrated than any other metabolite. And so right you have to suppress water, you're not getting that many much signal. Um, but it is label free, right? We don't have to use a contrast agent, you're using, you know, protons, um, you know, hydrogen nuclei, which is are present in everything. Um, so I think those are the pros, but it's certainly challenging and then you know, on the other side of things the analysis is difficult. So while there's some inline analysis so that you know, a radiologist can sit at the scanner and see peaks and get approximate idea of patterns. Um, it's not 100% quantitative, it's not standardized across sites. Um, I guess that's those are big medical imaging questions separately even from metabolism is um, are those limitations.",

That may do amplification but at the same time not perturbing the binding uh as Allison was um um commenting on.",
