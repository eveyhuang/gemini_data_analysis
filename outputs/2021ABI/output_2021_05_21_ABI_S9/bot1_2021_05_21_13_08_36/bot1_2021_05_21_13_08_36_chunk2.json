Um, so on the single cell level we're trying to um connect the dots, draw the correlation between Rama measurements on bothscopy and imaging side to uh single cell transcriptomics. Um, uh and also the massc uh measurement on the on the bulk level. Um, on the uh specially resolved level we're trying to identify new signatures from Raman and trying to um resolve the metabolic control um um um for uh disease systems. So uh recently we uh we're trying to identify uh the metabolicbilities during uh the development of drug resistance in uh non normal cancers.",

Our my lab is developing optical imaging techniques such as SRS and uh multiphoton fluorescence microscopy. So we have been integrating two imaging modalities together to visualize the metabolic activities in living living organisms. So there are two layers of of imaging approach. One is the label free including the fluorescence multiphoton fluorescence for example, we look at the NADH or flavor molecules in the living organism. And another layer is the Raman label free approach that we can visualize those lipids and protein information inside the animals and tissues. And we also want to separate the new molecules uh newly synthesized molecule from the older endogenous molecules. So we have been also labeled those metabolites such as using heavy water or labeled glucose amino acids to probe the metabolic activities in the live animals. So uh in that case we can separate those new molecules from the older molecules and uh quantitatively image the metabolic turnover rate for each of the um macro molecules in the in the body. And uh very glad to discuss with you all today. Thank you.",

I think we have a lot of people working on metabolites, also tons of different modalities and different approaches to imaging, which so should be a good discussion. Um, I mean, I guess to kick it off, we could start with the sort of first prompt, which I thought was kind of interesting was the idea of metabolites being a sort of early stage um reporter for bigger biological processes. So can they be used for diagnostic purposes and um maybe that would be a good place to start if people have some ideas about that topic.",

I think in terms of looking at metabolites uh or metabolic processes uh what I guess what are the targets, the variety of different targets that we're we're thinking about. I I guess uh summarizing different, you know, different people's uh intro, uh you know, we looked at uh newly synthesized metabolites as a sort of a whole class. Uh specific species um NADH NADH uh or oxygen uh as a proxy or or uh developing specific probes for a very specific metabolite. So uh there these are all possibilities. What are some of the advantages uh and challenges uh of targeting these different things for looking at metabolites and metabolic processes. And as Kevin mentioned uh perhaps, you know, patterns uh features of any of those, right? as a you know, class uh or as a individual species could be used for diagnostic purpose. Just to uh throw the question out there.",
