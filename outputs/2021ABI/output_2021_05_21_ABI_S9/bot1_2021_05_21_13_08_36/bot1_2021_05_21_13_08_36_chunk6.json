So you basically give the animal or the person deuterium labeled glucose and then just like you would in pet you watch the metabolic byproducts form and then you you wouldn't be able to see them on your spectrum unless for example a proton was transferred or you know metabolized from glucose to let's say lactate.",

Um the yeah, I I'd say that with my type of MRI, we um we say we want metabolism, but what we typically are saying is we want neural activity. And that's such a different thing and yet we say it and and that's sort of a mindset issue. Um the other thing is what out of the prompts that we started with, the idea that metabolic changes proceed physiological changes, I think when we're looking at the brain and and we are using physiological measures of um well what I would call physiological measures, we're using vascular properties to estimate a metabolic property. So the timeline of things is really important when we try to infer one from the other. So in the pathologies, knowing when we can trust our models of how vascular signals relate to metabolism or when those models have already broken down because metabolism wrecks the something about the vascular thing we're measuring. I'm not sure I'm being very coherent, but I feel like it's it's a big challenge that like with a lot of things with this neuro MRI view of metabolism, I feel like we're we're a bit superficial with it so far. With oxymetabolism, not MRS. I am not doing spectroscopy. Just to put that out there. That's a very different thing and much more interpretable.",
