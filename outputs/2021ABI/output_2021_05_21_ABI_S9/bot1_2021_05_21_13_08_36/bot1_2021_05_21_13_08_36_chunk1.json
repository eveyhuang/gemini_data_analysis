Uh, I mostly look at vascular measures, so perfusion, vascular regulation, um, but I try to also combine this with other MRI techniques and some modeling to pull out um oxygen metabolism. Uh, so often this is limited to something like oxygen extraction fraction, our resolution is very poor, our models are very limited, um, but we do try to map this in the brain.",
