Um and I'll just read the two questions um that were posed to us. How do we balance the issues of imaging across domains of time and space? Can we collect data at high resolution and across large spatial regions simultaneously like the way uh quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics methods span time and resolution methods in computational chemistry. Um we will need to have um one recorder reporter. So if someone would like to volunteer, you just can't have done it yesterday.",

And uh the reason I think I was probably put in this group is because I I'm very interested in protein trafficking within small structures known as cilia and cilia are diffraction limited and they're really important for a lot of developmental clinical things so they they receive Sonic Hedgehog signaling and so that's really important for patterning. And what's interesting is that the cilia generally in terms of human mutations, they're not they're not abolished so they're still present but there's just minor defects in trafficking within the cilia and to the cilia. And so something that the field needs is to be able to study cilia trafficking in either a cilia that's beating because sometimes they beat back and forth to generate flow. Um that's really challenging because they can beat up to 15 to 20 hertz. So trying to image a diffraction limited spot and something that's beating at 20 hertz uh would be a challenge and so that's the kind of stuff that I'm interested in. I have the biological expertise and I can do, you know, I do fluorescence imaging and and live cell imaging and super resolution imaging and stuff like that. But um I think that that problem will need something beyond that. So thanks.",

            "transcript": "Hey everyone, my name is Arnold Hayer. I'm a faculty in the Department of Biology in McGill University. And uh my lab is primarily interested in signal transduction that regulates cell motility. So migration of mammalian cells and uh not only of single cells but also of collective of groups of cells. So the the main challenge related to the topic of this breakout session um in the context of my research is I think to link molecular events to subcellular events and to super cellular events. So so it's kind of the we need to understand what's happening at the molecular level um what is happening with for example polymerizing acting structures um but they happen at a very very fast time scale and uh cells move at a much much slower cells time scale. So uh the the big challenge then is to to link uh these molecular events to the larger um cellular outcomes. And um I don't quite know how to do that because you know if we if we monitor on single molecules, we we can probably do that. Uh but how do we know that which molecular single event would then translate into a cell for example to polarize as a whole, which happens on the scale of tens of minutes. So that would be something to to think about. And regarding this this um other question of uh how can we uh collect simultaneous at different times of resolution. I I guess um one could think of of um imaging live cell imaging streams where you resolve where you try to monitor events at a relatively low resolution and then have online um automated image analysis that ident identifies relevant events, zooms in, goes at really high uh imaging frequency. So um this is something that we don't do but but that we that I thought could be something of interest because the technical challenges to overcome and and developing a robust workflow for for doing this.
