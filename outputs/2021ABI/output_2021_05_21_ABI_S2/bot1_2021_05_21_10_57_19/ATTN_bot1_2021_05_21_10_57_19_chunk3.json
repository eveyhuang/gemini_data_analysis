      "transcript": "So I think that's a good segue into the next thing I wanted to talk about, which is, um, I've been thinking a lot about how we can better integrate the different types of data that we're collecting. So, you know, we have the sleep data, we have the activity data, we have the cognitive data, and then we have the survey data. And I think that there's a lot of potential to get more out of these data if we can find ways to integrate them better. So I was thinking about a couple of different approaches. One is to use machine learning to try to identify patterns in the data that are predictive of certain outcomes. So for example, we could try to predict who is going to have a cognitive decline based on their sleep and activity data. Another approach would be to use causal inference methods to try to understand how sleep and activity affect cognitive function. So for example, we could try to estimate the effect of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance. I'm curious to hear what you all think about these ideas and if you have any other suggestions.",
