But if we use 488 for example, 488 have a little bit different focus point, the the plan is different, so we want to adjust a little bit to overlap. But you can also do that if we use different visible laser. But I think the two photon fluorescence will be a better choice because you don't need to adjust the focus focus plan anymore.",

So I was wondering if you would if we can talk at all about your osteoblast, osteocyte and cellular metabolism and if a model will help?",

And I think that um, you know, just using using structural information at larger scales and then kind of how you would um either multimodal to get different information or then use that spatial information to decide where to sample with high resolution. I think either of you might be able to contribute um some ideas here.",

And then um what I have done is that didn't describe how the necrosis starts, okay? So uh what I had contributed was that I also have have another simultaneous equation where um I describe the oxygen partial pressure. I would get that from the spec imaging, okay? And then uh where the oxygen partial pressure goes down to zero is where the necrosis will start in the tumor. So uh so that I can now start evolving this tumor equation with time and now the necrosis will start. So there is like I thought that that might easily translate to something that Dr. was saying because I can describe the cellular metabolism and the physical structures of the uh osteoblast and osteocytes, you know, population and I could apply it to the anybody else's cellular um like you know, all the things other things that we discussed.",
