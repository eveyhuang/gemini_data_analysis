Um, so to visualize this we need very high resolution um methods like super resolution microscopy. Um, but these super resolution microscopy methods are often very slow. Um, and so we also are interested in dynamics of the nucleus and to study that we have to do it separately. Um, so um for example label subsets of um um chromatin interacting proteins or chromatin components and and track their dynamics at fast time scales.",
