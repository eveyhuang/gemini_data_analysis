And what's interesting is that the cilia generally in terms of human mutations, they're not they're not abolished so they're still present but there's just minor defects in trafficking within the cilia and to the cilia. And so something that the field needs is to be able to study cilia trafficking in either a cilia that's beating because sometimes they beat back and forth to generate flow. Um that's really challenging because they can beat up to 15 to 20 hertz. So trying to image a diffraction limited spot and something that's beating at 20 hertz uh would be a challenge and so that's the kind of stuff that I'm interested in.

So so it's kind of the we need to understand what's happening at the molecular level um what is happening with for example polymerizing acting structures um but they happen at a very very fast time scale and uh cells move at a much much slower cells time scale. So uh the the big challenge then is to to link uh these molecular events to the larger um cellular outcomes. And um I don't quite know how to do that because you know if we if we monitor on single molecules, we we can probably do that. Uh but how do we know that which molecular single event would then translate into a cell for example to polarize as a whole, which happens on the scale of tens of minutes. So that would be something to to think about. And regarding this this um other question of uh how can we uh collect simultaneous at different times of resolution. I I guess um one could think of of um imaging live cell imaging streams where you resolve where you try to monitor events at a relatively low resolution and then have online um automated image analysis that ident identifies relevant events, zooms in, goes at really high uh imaging frequency. So um this is something that we don't do but but that we that I thought could be something of interest because the technical challenges to overcome and and developing a robust workflow for for doing this.

So that's that's a different story. And typically you're imaging them if you if you need to do temporal imaging, you need to image them at around 100 hertz to get reliable, you know, wave forms. And so we do that with DIC. So DIC microscopy with just a camera is the best way to track the ciliary wave form. Um, but then if you want to track trafficking within this bending whip like wave form, that's where you need to do fluorescence. And so what the field has done is that they've either taken cilia that are beating and immobilized them pharmacologically so that they're not beating and then tracked protein trafficking within them. But that's such a major perturbation that, you know, we still don't know what protein trafficking within a beating cilium looks like because of that. So one thing, yeah, I don't know, you know, and now you can do the combined DIC fluorescence, you know, that's not a challenging technique, but getting enough signal is then that becomes the challenge. So getting enough signal from what could be one to five proteins and part of like a particle train, um, to get enough signal from that to reliably track it within the wave form seems to be where the barrier is, if that makes any sense.

Because maybe you know you're you're you know, I know you can you can you can separate mitochondria and nucleus, you know, things big structures really well. But if you wanted to label something like say a cilium so that you could identify it with fluorescence and then image the cilium with Raman, how can you separate out the fluorescence from the Raman signal?
