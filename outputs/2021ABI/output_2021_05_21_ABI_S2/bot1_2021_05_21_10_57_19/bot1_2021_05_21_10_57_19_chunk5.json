I wanted to go back to there's a little bit of a shared theme between Arnold and Malika's introduction, right? In both cases, I think they talked about, for example, Arnold talk about temporally, you know, do slow imaging and then zoom in, you know, get something you're interested and you do fast imaging focusing on the processes that you really want to study in detail. And Malika talked about spatially, maybe lower resolution imaging and then you find something interesting and zoom in do super resolution at really high resolution imaging. I found that that shared theme very interesting. Um do we want to as a group talk a little bit about that? Uh what are the challenges um and and um there's a little bit of a right? AI guided automatic zooming in that's already been done what what's people's experience and um do we want to discuss a little bit more about that?",

You don't have molecular labeling. So how hard is it to know if the event in your case I guess specifically, I know generalizing is difficult um that the event would have started occurring if you had a label free measurement that was lower resolution and then you could switch over to doing some sort of super res. I mean that requires integrating across data modalities but it's it's pretty easy to integrate some of these label free methods in an opposing arm on the microscope and so then you could try and image that way and then switch over. So but the question is will you actually know it's happening with a label free method if you don't have a molecular readout and I don't know if that's the case or not.",
