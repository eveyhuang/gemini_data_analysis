I also wonder what it would look like tying into this it it feels to me that the computation like we were hard to translate that directly to imaging because if you don't if you sample at a low resolution, you don't you're missing in some sense.",

But let's say you pick that out and then you're you're taking all of the system, you know, performance you can possibly muster and then in between that layer before you actually save the data, you have something that can run at quasi real time show you, okay, this is important or not based on this highest quality data we can get and then only storing, you know, because this is something that we talked about yesterday as well with super resolution and light sheet. I mean, just the amount of data get",

It's like anything else. If you alias the signal, it's done that is not you can't go can't go back. I mean, maybe you can.

And since we have been increasingly applying this on the human scalp uh for the long term and um continuous monitoring of this brain signal for um at least the free moving bodies. And if we don't have a high spatial resolution, we won't be able to get into the for example cortex layer and then to understand the language uh cognition aging and a lot of the other logical mechanisms. And if we miss the temporal resolution and some of those process may happen at least within a second or a few seconds and uh for example, some people have been talking about uh FMRI functional MRI and that has been super high spatial resolution but it takes uh um really limited um uh time and also be uh confined into the space.
