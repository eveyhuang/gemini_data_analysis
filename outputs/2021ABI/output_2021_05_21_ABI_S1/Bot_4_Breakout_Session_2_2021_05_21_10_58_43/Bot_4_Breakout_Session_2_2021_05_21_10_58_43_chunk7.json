Um, on my end it's this kind of question of how do you adjust your acquisition so that you're reducing the density of your data or after the fact, how do you analyze your data with these kind of coarse versus finer analyses? Because, you know, you could go to Janelia and get time on this super awesome microscope and they'll give you 10 terabytes of data at the end of it, but it and then analyzing it is your problem and and trying to mine that data is your problem and that takes tons of time um if if you're if you're not sure either because of a machine learning approach or because of an experimental observation if you're not sure where the timing matters or where the spatial and temporal kind of scale fits for your for your behavior or for your proteins of interest.

So I I definitely think um if if we're thinking about multimodal integrations, you know, then it definitely becomes a question of being able to identify in real time what's data so that you can determine which multimodal imaging system with different temporal and spatial resolution you want to use. Um, I think one thing though that's confusing me a little bit or you know still a mystery is that I don't I don't know how to make it into sort of a systematic approach, meaning like um you know I'm used to sort of comparatively thinking about all of the different imaging modalities, but how do we make this an approach which can which can be equally applied to microscopy and and and image guided surgery? You know, like how do we that's that's where I'm still haven't quite",
