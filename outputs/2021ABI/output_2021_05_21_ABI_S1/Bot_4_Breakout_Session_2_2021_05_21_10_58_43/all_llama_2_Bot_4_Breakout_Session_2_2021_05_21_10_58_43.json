And if we miss the temporal resolution and some of those process may happen at least within a second or a few seconds and uh for example, some people have been talking about uh FMRI functional MRI and that has been super high spatial resolution but it takes uh um really limited um uh time and also be uh confined into the space.

But as a pro person here, I like the idea of installing, you know, really high functioning synthetic probes because they have just sometimes they have better, you know, physical properties, they don't photobleach as well and we can design it to look at the longer wavelengths and multiplex in a specific way. So then it brought up to a question, can we label biomolecules of interest in a known density so that our spatial temporal imaging or, you know, interaction partner seeking that can be relevant to, you know, disease, you know, how can we, you know, design a system that is experimentally addressable? For example, if we label everything in the system is going to be super bright and it might not give you that resolution either time or space to look at the processes that you want to look at. So from the chemistry perspective, my question is, can we design a way to, you know, label the molecule that we want in a very defined density we want to target the specific temporal and spatial resolution.",
