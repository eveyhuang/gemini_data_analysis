So we'd like to capture that dynamics and build up at the molecular scale within a single cell and then how that is then communicated to neighboring cells within a larger 2D environment and then eventually 3D tissue.",

And then collecting more data than you need, that kind of goes to this computational approach as a as a potential solution and then cross the scales of biology, multimodal imaging would potentially allow you to monitor something in the seconds to minutes time scale using a very high resolution approach and then potentially shift on the minutes to hours time scale to a single cell or a single area of a tissue and then ideally whole organism kind of thing on the days to whatever time scale.",
