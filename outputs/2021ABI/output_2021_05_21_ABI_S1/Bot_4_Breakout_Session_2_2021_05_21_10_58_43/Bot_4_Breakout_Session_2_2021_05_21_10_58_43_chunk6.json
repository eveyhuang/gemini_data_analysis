So I think you you need the you need the simulation, like thinking even if you had this kind of QMM paradigm where you are simulating and you can tune it, I think if you have that kind of model for a system, then as the microscopist, you can decide, okay, I know that these time scales are important for this particular part of the system and so I'm going to you know, and and then thinking just just practically as the engineer, I'm going to have the system running at top performance and then I'm going to have some middleman grabbing all that raw data, the middleman has to be fast enough, maybe we use an FPGA or something on board to decide what to keep or what not to keep and kind of put a reasonable reasonable format.",
