            "transcript": "Uh, I think one idea uh that was brought up by a few people was pretty exciting. Uh, the idea of um I can summarize it as adaptive imaging. So I think Josh bring out this idea so first you have low resolution imaging and then you come in with high resolution imaging. So um so uh we can combine with MRI, right? So I was I forgot this person's name, but I was talking to another person in the breakout session that they were developing this low field MRI where they can be portable as a probe, right? So imagine uh you are doing uh clinic session and you have this probe with MRI and you're doing this scanning and then when you have a suspicious area, you heard a beep from the AI algorithms and then you have a needle that comes out that gives you the optical fiber and then insert into do kind of do a real time at a point of procedure diagnosis. Uh, so kind of combine this non-invasive MRI with non with minimal invasive optical cellular resolution imaging.",

            "transcript": "Yes, so just from my my experience, I guess, that's um one area that in terms of optical imaging that, you know, I've tried to to develop was using actually fluorescence lifetime imaging of in a macroscopic view of tissue and oral cavity. Um and then using um we developed a confocal microscope that also would go into the world cavity and we design our own miniature lens that's about um less than a centimeter in diameter. So it's relatively small, can fit inside. Um and there you're doing kind of that point measurement, but it's with imaging looking at um cell nuclei um that have been identified based on the metabolic changes in the tissue um using the fluorescence lifetime. There's one other group that also uses distortion in the lens so that um on it captures a larger field of view that has a worse resolution, but at the center it has better resolution um but a very limited field of view so that you could use it to kind of guide around um and then you if you see something at the edge of the focus then you move it to the center and you get that higher resolution in the center. So there's just a couple ideas of some and then one thing that I I didn't really hear being brought up but photoacoustic imaging for increased depth um we didn't really discuss but for that kind of multimodality and and using a different type of excitation through your in comparison to your detection.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I do think that the photoacoustic is feasible for MRI as well. So I do see great illustration about this kidney and they embedded this photoacoustic and try to induce the ultrasound outside and try to write it up and you can also do the same thing with MRI that might be really interesting way to look at the photoacoustic. We don't have any chance to discuss that.",

I think really makes a difference in be able to work with it um because it yeah, it is a lot of a lot of data.",

So uh but uh then I guess it's a trade off then maybe we cannot get to hear some people's opinions um maybe. So maybe we could do like first round table uh introduction round table short ideas and then uh more uh just kind of just very casual uh coherent fluid discussions.",

            "transcript": "Yes, I do feel that especially in this virtual format that it does feel like okay, it's your turn to talk and there's a little bit less flow. Um I was wondering if it would be better after the introductions that if each person talk like briefly state what they're interested in discussing and you could almost like group them in and say okay, first we're going to talk about this particular direction and then we'll cover this direction. Um so that would be one thought. I think it's hard because of the the topics are relatively broad actually even though you know, in some ways they're specific, but they're relatively broad and you can approach them in different ways and so it's um it's almost hard to put your ideas into, you know, kind of groups. You know, and when I was looking at this topic I was thinking we could talk about new applications for super resolution that are, you know, it's not currently applied to. We could talk about different um advances to the implementation and then um I was also I was glad to see that there were people from MRI in here that if we could um get some information from other fields in imaging that might influence our approaches. Um but I do feel that each person had something different to add that um it might have been hard to kind of narrow down the topics because they are um there's so much to cover. I think. But I hope that you continue to have your discussions with each other in the different um gather rooms or towns or without you get to be in um so you can continue these uh conversations.",
