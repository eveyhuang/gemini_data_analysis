So I'm hoping to use machine learning to predict the catalyst performance and also to design new catalysts. And I'm also interested in using machine learning to optimize the reaction conditions. So basically, I'm trying to use machine learning to make the CO2 electrocatalysis process more efficient and more sustainable. And I'm also interested in using machine learning to understand the reaction mechanism.
