Uh I really like the second question, how can we mitigate or utilize multiple scattering when we transition this technique to invivo applications? I think there are two ways to think about it. So if we are talking about like traditional super resolution techniques like in optics, uh multiple scattering is the enemy because they scramble your light. So the first way to think about it is how can we gate these multiple scattering? How can we reject them so that we can only get ballistic photons that carry the truly valuable information. And then so I guess one direction along this way is to think how can we more efficiently uh select these ballistic photons. And then a second direction, a second perspective on this is how do we use multiple scattering to get more information? Because these ballistic photons decay exponentially as you go deeper into the tissue. Uh so if we can use the but multiple scattering uh process looks random, but it's deterministic. So if we have physics model that can take advantage of this uh interference and use that to our advantage because with multiple scattering, you can actually get more angles, right? So with that you get more field of view, you get more uh uh resolution. So uh I I think that part is pretty interesting.",

My training is in engineering and specifically in electrical engineering. I did my PhD work in um biomedical optics, specifically looking at how to use optical wavefront shaping to peer deeper into tissue. And so I really resonated with what we were just talking about about the second option, which I think is the much better one, maybe unbiased, but uh to try to harness the multiply scattered photons and in some sense redeem those to make them make them useful for our for our optical imaging techniques. Uh the last thing I'll say is just that as an engineer, I'm a tool builder by nature and so I'm really looking forward to meeting all of you and hearing about Kristen what you said in the main session really resonated with me too. How can I bring engineering skills to bear to solve solve problems? So thanks.",

Um, so we do um like two photon, we're moving towards like second harmonic, third harmonic generation type stuff. Um, and we're looking at moving to kind of like near IR wavelengths to get um, I guess with 1300, 1700 to kind of like peer deeper into tissue and also some scattering correction approaches um to look at um as how much we can get in there and try to get rid of things that are causing negative interference, etc. And um um I guess our application is looking at bone and muscle regeneration primarily.",
