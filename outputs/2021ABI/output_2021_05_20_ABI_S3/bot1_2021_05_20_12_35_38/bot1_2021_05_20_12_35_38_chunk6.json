So we don't do it in that sense, but maybe Oze, maybe you've already discussed like compressed sensing. I'm not sure if we've gotten that far, but in MR, we do kind of have ways that we refer to as super resolution, but certainly not in the same way. I came I heard multiplexing. So I imagine we're talking about optical imaging.",

I have been reading and I have been approached a couple of colleagues to use the ultra high field to change the optical properties.",

And so I do think I'm really glad that there are two of you that are in MR in this room because I feel like as you discuss with each other in the next couple days, um if you can talk about um how you approach you know, resolution and improving resolution and some like compressed sensing, you know, which is applied in both fields, but the different approaches, I think sometimes it's hard for them to bridge over those those gaps between fields. And so the more you can talk together about, well, how do you do this or why do you do that or um there's a real opportunity there I think in terms of working together across fields. Um, so I'll just point that out. Um, we have about um 15 minutes left, I believe. Um, yeah. And so uh we'll maybe just talk for another five minutes and then I think we should revisit kind of our key points and and try to narrow those down so that when Josh reports out, we have a a more focused report out.",

Um I don't know, let's say entangled photons for instance example, right? Uh are there cute little tricks that we could do to uh make them more robust to what classical detection would fail at. Uh you know, maybe it it requires us to to go about that way. Just just a thought.",

Uh, so that's one way and I feel like uh the notion you mentioned entangled photons could be very interesting because people are already doing that for telescope and as we know, we are the retarded grandkids from the astronomers as micro says. So maybe maybe that's the I I feel like that could be a very high risk, high reward uh uh notion to do.",

So maybe it's it's not just the spectral properties but also um like the luminescence lifetime of those materials that that can then be used as as labels um for certain features um of of interest, right? And one example um uh material is called up conversion nano particles that have anti stokes emission um they um typically have luminescence lifetimes in like the millisecond or microsecond range. So that's um orders of magnitude difference to to what you would have with the commercial for so this may also be uh helpful in the end.",
