Uh, now I'm in my fourth year as a system professor and my research group focuses on nanomedicine, so applying nanotechnology for treatment and diagnosis of cancer specifically and we are interested in understanding um the transport of drug carriers and small molecule drugs through the body and how those drug carriers interact with cell surface. So for us super resolution information is is really the key to understand those transport pathways. Um, and my lab is applying techniques such as expansion microscopy to get a better understanding of those intracellular transport pathways.",

I'm electrical engineer in principle, but I have been doing biomedical stuff since I graduated and that includes all developing new techniques for diagnostic purpose of MRI and the reason I'm interested in super resolution is always try to find the link between the lab resolution to to in vivo or contact animal resolution so microscopic scale. So I always keep an eye on what's happening in the smaller scale higher super resolution and to see what can be translatable to animal. So my research is ranging from cancer to neurological imaging and lipidomics to metabolomics and also cancer and also includes physiological intervention and also bone sodium content and X nuclei and phosphorus all types of imaging but I really like to make the link between the lab to do from bench to bedside actually.",

Um, and so especially now we push to multiphoton two, three, I don't know, can we do four or five? Like at what level does that get so complicated and so expensive that it's not really it's not really useful. And so I I would really like to I think my background is is in more of the second thinking more about the second part of this question, but I think what intrigues me about this room is thinking about the two of these together, especially because super resolution microscopy I think is often speaking as somebody who's not well trained in that area, but seems to me to be very photon start in general.

So I I think that I really like the thinking about how how can we maybe take these two together and I'm not I haven't seen too much looking at super resolution combined with thinking deeper into tissue and how to think about scattering. And the last thing I'll say just to uh is I also wonder what the room is for conversations in between let's say minimally invasive types of technology as a stepping stone to getting to the ultimate goal where we just shine some light outside the body and then capture everything outside the body non invasively, but maybe minimally invasive with um, you know, fibers, fiber bundles, uh, these kind of things can be a a nice stepping stone to push things into the into practice because I think with biomedical imaging outside of the like really big success of OCT, there's not so many optical like biomedical optical techniques that have really made a significant um, you know, push into the clinic.",

So there is something um I was thinking about. Uh, I was doing uh uh super resolution when I was doing super resolution microscope, I always wanted to stabilize the sample so that with a with a long uh long-term imaging for example like 30 minutes, I don't get a great uh sample drift. So one way I was thinking while I was a postdoc is to use the scattering light from the cell. So we take uh we take the scattering light the image using scattering light of the cell at at the beginning of the imaging and after a few minutes we take another one. So by the end like by the end of the imaging we could use those image to align um kind of put to the kind of uh correct the drift. So that's one thing I was thinking about. Uh, but I haven't tapped it. I'm not sure how precisely I can do as my uh uh I claim a 10 nanometer uh uh uh precision. So I'm trying to make sure how I can how precisely I can do that. And uh some thoughts for the first uh question like how can super resolution uh methods can be translated to uh uh organismal applications. Um, I have been thinking about that for the past few years. Um, one thing I found uh uh that could be helpful is maybe lizing the floor for chemistry because right now uh I spend a lot of time on doing uh imaging analysis uh like look at all the localization and how to cluster them and how to figure out the organization of the proteins. But uh at the end of the day I thought if we could use different floor for to map these what I mean is if I put it in a example, see if we have a DNA molecule, they can uh kind of fold into different structure. Like if we wanted to figure out the structure, let's see uh we can use uh maybe the barcoding system like we can since we know the sequence we probably can uh use the barcoding to map the entire sequence, then then we label that the molecule uh ourselves, then we can image that maybe we know we would figure out like uh how they position the spatial. So that's So I think um maybe uh aside from the imaging processing just using AI or deep learning to look at the cluster or organization, maybe uh uh floor for can might be helpful. That was my thought.",
