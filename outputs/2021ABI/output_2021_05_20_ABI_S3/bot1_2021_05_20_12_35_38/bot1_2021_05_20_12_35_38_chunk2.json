We're going to start with Kristen talking about her recent work on the Texas A&M project. Then we'll move on to Uzay, who will be discussing his latest findings from Purdue. Following Uzay, Vivian will share her progress on the McGill project. And finally, Josh will update us on his work at Harvey Mudd College. So, without further ado, let's get started. Kristen, the floor is yours.",
