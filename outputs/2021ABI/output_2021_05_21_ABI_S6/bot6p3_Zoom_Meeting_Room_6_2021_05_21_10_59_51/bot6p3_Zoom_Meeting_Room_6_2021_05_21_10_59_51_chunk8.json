So if you're going to add imaging to it, it can't be more than $50,000. So, so there's all sorts of commercial issues and, you know, nanoparticles are multi component. So if you in the rules of FDA approval, you've now got to get each component approved and then there's all sorts of questions about whether it's a drug or whether it's a device.
