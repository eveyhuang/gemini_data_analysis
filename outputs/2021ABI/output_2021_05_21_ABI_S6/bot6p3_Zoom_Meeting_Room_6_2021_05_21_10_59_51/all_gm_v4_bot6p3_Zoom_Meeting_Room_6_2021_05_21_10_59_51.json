Um so the dyes have to be quite bright. Um and the problem is if you want to, you know, it'd be great. we're looking at like ratiometric imaging next to be able to get um, you know, a more precise read and more quantitative. The problem is is then you got to go back and change all the clinical systems and there are now, you know, 5,000, 6,000 robots around the world. So there's definitely an instrumentation issue. Like where the image the the issue is the cost is really high for the camera systems. Um so it's really hard to get a company like a big company like Intuitive to move on something um unless there's really a clear clear benefit because they're going to have to go back through the FDA process and go modify out all their instruments.

I mean you you talk about protease activity, we talk about um uh cancer cell specific internalization to activate therapeutics which are also fluorescent. So my question I'm I guess posing to the group is that aside from the contrast agent development, the concept of using multiplexed imaging or ratiometric imaging specifically with respect to to hyperspectral mixing etc. What's the bottleneck to moving that into the clinic because if you're already doing ratiometric in in patients then what's what's left in terms of pushing those boundaries?",

So these are all the strengths. nanoparticles have obviously weaknesses sometimes because their size can get in the way, they can have their own kinetic properties or something like this. But but if you come back to that multimodality strength, then the question sort of becomes what are the things to match. So X-ray contrast agents are inherently insensitive. So you know, fluorescence or or a pet spec system incredibly sensitive.",

So you need a really, really good question to motivate solving that problem. I mean, one way that's a little bit simpler conceptual, I guess is if you have the same probes, you can use for example, like X-ray fluorescence as a ground truth read out at the end stage of an experiment where you may have some kind of a temporal uh imaging or sensing ability over a time course. So and then you can kind of ground truth it at the end. So those combinations I think uh are probably a little bit simpler and easier to justify uh building those kinds of contrast agents.",

So if you have a protease that's on in your cancer, but the problem is that protease is also present in normal tissue. Uh you can get some contrast, but you can't get great contrast. But if you add now a second signal that only is present the two of them together in the tumor and not in normal tissue, um you get a very specific signal and that's worked really well for us for optical. We can find multiple proteases that are sort of only on together in in in that environment. But you could do it with anything, right? Like a protease and pH or oxygen levels and something. What what are people's thoughts about that and the potential applications in in uh nanoparticles? Like is that something that could be engineered into nanoparticles into a single nanoparticle to respond to multiple inputs?",

So for all our MR applications, we don't try to load up AV because it's it's just too small of a load. But there's a lot of genetic encoding and adding into the AAV genome uh part of the genome that will then express a contrast agent where it's been integrated and they do that for iron uh deposition and or iron contrast based agents. Uh in terms of though going back to your immune cells, um it is in a sense fairly straightforward I believe to track immune cells by MRI and that could be applied to spinal cord injury and you could do that with either iron oxides or fluorine. If you would want quantitative then fluorine would be the way to go. It's just not very well established in the clinic yet.",

So if you're going to add imaging to it, it can't be more than $50,000. So, so there's all sorts of commercial issues and, you know, nanoparticles are multi component. So if you in the rules of FDA approval, you've now got to get each component approved and then there's all sorts of questions about whether it's a drug or whether it's a device.
