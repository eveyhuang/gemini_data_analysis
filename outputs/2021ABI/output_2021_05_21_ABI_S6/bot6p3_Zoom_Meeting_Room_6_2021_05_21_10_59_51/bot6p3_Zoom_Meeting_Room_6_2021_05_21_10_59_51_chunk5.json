So I think distinguishing between those two will will help things move forward because I do think merging modalities is probably the future at least when we talk about multimodal.",

So if you have a protease that's on in your cancer, but the problem is that protease is also present in normal tissue. Uh you can get some contrast, but you can't get great contrast. But if you add now a second signal that only is present the two of them together in the tumor and not in normal tissue, um you get a very specific signal and that's worked really well for us for optical. We can find multiple proteases that are sort of only on together in in in that environment. But you could do it with anything, right? Like a protease and pH or oxygen levels and something. What what are people's thoughts about that and the potential applications in in uh nanoparticles? Like is that something that could be engineered into nanoparticles into a single nanoparticle to respond to multiple inputs?",

Uh we've used it for paired agent imaging in vivo just to basically delineate between specific binding versus non specific pooling of the nanoparticle and that helps us not only account for um any uh background phenomena that has nothing to do with the receptor status but we also do it just to detect to see if our constructs are actually specific or not. So thinking along those lines in my opinion very very humble opinion if we are going to be working towards nanoparticles for uh actual sensing imaging image guided surgery, it has to be multiplexed.",

But what are the properties that would be good in terms of contrast?",

So it is a bit multimodality in terms of the pre clinical side and trying to kind of use the two modalities to inform each other and see if we can um so what are the goals in in in spinal cord injury is um trying to have acute non-invasive imaging that will let you know the extent of the damage and what the patient's long-term outcome would be. And so um really a lot of that has just been done on inherent um you know like um MRI and DTI and and looking at diffusion of water. But having a contrast agent that can um work well in multiple scenarios, multiple amounts of edema and swelling um and really give kind of precise evidence of a biological event would be would be interesting.",
