Um so the dyes have to be quite bright. Um and the problem is if you want to, you know, it'd be great. we're looking at like ratiometric imaging next to be able to get um, you know, a more precise read and more quantitative. The problem is is then you got to go back and change all the clinical systems and there are now, you know, 5,000, 6,000 robots around the world. So there's definitely an instrumentation issue. Like where the image the the issue is the cost is really high for the camera systems. Um so it's really hard to get a company like a big company like Intuitive to move on something um unless there's really a clear clear benefit because they're going to have to go back through the FDA process and go modify out all their instruments.
