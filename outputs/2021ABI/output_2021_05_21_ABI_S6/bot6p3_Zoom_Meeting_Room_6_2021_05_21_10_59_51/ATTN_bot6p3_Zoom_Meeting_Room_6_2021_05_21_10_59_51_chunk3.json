One camp has been more like developing of new conscious agents like quantum dots and getting getting the right kinds of dyes and all these other things. But I feel like a lot of those studies they end up kind of going back to the same kind of reporter systems like RGD peptide or you know, antibodies or other things.",

Or or or DNA winding and and and opening up like in vivo sensing um uh uh conformational changes or or or sort of um um other chemical changes that that that maybe aren't typical for for today's studies.

I was going to say that we I agree with the the issues of uh getting intracellularly and even extracellularly, we have to worry about the distribution in vivo and one of the ways that we approach that are are um is to look at using ratiometric probes where they're not one single probe but that we have two nanoparticles that are you know, externally look identical but are two different colors and so we can say the targeted one versus the isotype control, what's the ratio of of their presence in a tumor for example. And so thinking about the fact that ratiometric doesn't have to be um self-contained uh to give information that that level of control can be helpful.",

Uh one example is in X-ray fluorescence is uh could be used as a contrast. You could have uh you know think about metallic uh rare elements as sometimes they're inherent and and looking for this signal fluorescing from those uh rare elements metals could be a signal but this is so so small in quantity and when you talk about bigger uh you know objects, you really don't get anything out unless you bombard the organ with a lot of X-rays.",
