And so, um, this is for for a lot of gene therapy they're considered a delivery vehicle. Um, and since they don't integrate into the genome, but they can provide genetic information and they can be engineered to have cell type specificity. So there's been a lot of engineering of AAVs so that they can specifically infect immune cells or neurons. Um, there's recent development AAVs that can cross the blood brain barrier. Um, so they can be delivered systemically but still get into the brain or or spinal cord. But essentially they are a nanoparticle, a, you know, a natural nanoparticle that delivers genetic information. So I'm I'm wondering if there's ever been any use of them to deliver non genetic information.",

So for all our MR applications, we don't try to load up AV because it's it's just too small of a load. But there's a lot of genetic encoding and adding into the AAV genome uh part of the genome that will then express a contrast agent where it's been integrated and they do that for iron uh deposition and or iron contrast based agents. Uh in terms of though going back to your immune cells, um it is in a sense fairly straightforward I believe to track immune cells by MRI and that could be applied to spinal cord injury and you could do that with either iron oxides or fluorine. If you would want quantitative then fluorine would be the way to go. It's just not very well established in the clinic yet.",

So there's obviously certain bacteria that accumulate in tumors and and around immune cells, there's exosomes. There's sort of blood cells that have been emptied out and filled up with things. So I I think it's a a very important point that you've raised is sort of using more biocompatible or biological delivery nanoparticles and to me that would be a very, you know, the next 10 years is going to be filled with a lot of that of taking concepts from the last 10 years but then packaging them up ways now that you can achieve more exquisite targeting to sites, blood brain barrier, CNS barrier and things like that.",
