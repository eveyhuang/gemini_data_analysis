The phase information people have studied in optical regime, uh like you might have heard of phase contrast uh microscopes, right? So the idea is very similar, but creating this uh in X-ray regime is very challenging because of the high frequencies of uh of X-rays.",

And having said that, there can be a lot of interest in developing contrast agents specifically for these these new imaging systems, which yeah we we don't we are aiming not to have contrast agents, but if there is there are the right contrast agents, uh maybe in small dose, this could be very powerful. Uh the other interest could be looking at multimodality. We are also interested in near infrared optical imaging which is through just blood uh vasculature. Uh so one of the long-term goals could also be to think about multimodality systems and could there be contrast agents which would play play the strength of two modalities at once. This these are just ideas uh and interest that we would have for anyone who has ideas with contrast agents for us to use.",

I mean, I think the the sort of the drive of the talking points on the slide are sort of related more towards like the pushing new boundaries and new directions for generating contrast. So sort of what are those what are the new directions we have to think about going for contrast agents and what are some of the basic science principles that we need to sort of come up with new probe strategies. So uh does anyone want to open up with some thoughts? I mean, it sounds like there's a lot of people working in, you know, nanoparticle related stuff. I myself work more on um chemical entities that are like activatable fluorescent probes. So it's interesting to hear about what's going on with um nanoparticles because they they have incredible promise. It's just that quantum dots and other things have had issues going into, you know, in vivo systems.",

Uh you may have to pay for the shipping because that weighs me down a little bit but um if you want such a die uh contact me or go to my website and then sort of learn a little bit about that but um I'm happy to talk about that separately to other people but uh yeah.",

Um so the dyes have to be quite bright. Um and the problem is if you want to, you know, it'd be great. we're looking at like ratiometric imaging next to be able to get um, you know, a more precise read and more quantitative. The problem is is then you got to go back and change all the clinical systems and there are now, you know, 5,000, 6,000 robots around the world. So there's definitely an instrumentation issue. Like where the image the the issue is the cost is really high for the camera systems. Um so it's really hard to get a company like a big company like Intuitive to move on something um unless there's really a clear clear benefit because they're going to have to go back through the FDA process and go modify out all their instruments. Um but it can happen. It just has to be really good.",

So um one thing that I that that I think about a lot is that um at least for nanoparticles, there's an abundance of all sorts of variants of contrast agents for nanoparticles whether it be uh positron emission tomography, MRI, etc etc. Um but at least because I focus more on the optical side, the ratiometric part is a lot more important. I mean you you talk about protease activity, we talk about um uh cancer cell specific internalization to activate therapeutics which are also fluorescent. So my question I'm I guess posing to the group is that aside from the contrast agent development, the concept of using multiplexed imaging or ratiometric imaging specifically with respect to to hyperspectral mixing etc. What's the bottleneck to moving that into the clinic because if you're already doing ratiometric in in patients then what's what's left in terms of pushing those boundaries?",
