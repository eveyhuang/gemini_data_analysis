So we're going to do a clinical trial in women who have had breast cancer and have completed their treatment, and we're going to look at the effects of exercise on their immune system. And we're going to look at the effects of exercise on their quality of life. And we're going to look at the effects of exercise on their body composition. And we're going to look at the effects of exercise on their gut microbiome.",

And then we're going to be using bioinformatics tools to analyze the data and see how the microbiome changes with exercise.
