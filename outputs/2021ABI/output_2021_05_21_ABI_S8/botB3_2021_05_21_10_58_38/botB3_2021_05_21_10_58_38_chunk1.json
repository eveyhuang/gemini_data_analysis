Uh, but I also like to think about how all of that vascular infrastructure supports or doesn't support healthy neural function. So, um, I do a lot of work now in in patients thinking about rehabilitation. So what can we do after something's happened to try to recover and repair both the neural and vascular systems.",

Uh to to study uh the cell skeleton. And so my my lab we kind of took that interest in in the cell skeleton to ask a very simple question. How does a heart grow on a single cell level? Meaning how does a single heart muscle cell physically get bigger? And that is one of the main drivers of our lab. Uh and we do attack that in multiple ways and it occurred to us a few years ago, actually about a year ago now that we could use the same technologies we're using to start mimicking what's happening inside of patients in in a in a uh basically a dish. And so we are now developing uh systems to mimic ischemia and reperfusion injury in our cardiac myos and that's allowed us to start doing screening and I have no idea what I'm doing and it's phenomenal. I have we're having a very good time. Uh and so we are kind of all over the place. We're we're looking at individual sarcomeres and we're looking to find some drugs.",

I think most relevant to this meeting in some is some work I'm pursuing on physics based filtering of um uh in vivo MRI uh with a focus on 4D flow MRI and reconstructing blood flow and measurements in a way that the underlying physics is satisfied, so principles like mass and momentum conservation and then using those principles to infer auxiliary measurements that um cannot be measured by imaging such as blood pressure, uh shear stresses, um uh and so forth.

So a lot of these really sophisticated imaging techniques using state of the art nano optics can actually be realized on a single optical surface, which is then uh nano patterned in intricate ways and then can really be easily deployed in a variety of in vivo and ex vivo applications.

So I study neural crest cells um and those cells are really dynamic and they make a lot of different um adult tissues, but probably more relevant to this group, uh all of the molecular mechanisms that allow those cells to undergo EMT are then re uh reused by cancer cells to metastasize. And so what we are doing in my lab is really trying to get at the basal function of the proteins that allow these cells to undergo EMT and to migrate and differentiate and then um at least my postdoc is really interested in trying to define whether those functions um are conserved in disease states. And so we do a lot of fixed and live imaging of these cells to get at um how the collective migration works um and and the paths that these cells take and then um hopefully how that's affected by perturbations of these different proteins.",
