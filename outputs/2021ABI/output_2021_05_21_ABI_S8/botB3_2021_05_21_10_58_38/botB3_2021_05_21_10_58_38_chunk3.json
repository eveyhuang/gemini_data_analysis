And so we have a really uh significant issue if we focus on one model organism and there's no confirmation of of pathways, molecular pathways for treatments. And so as you mentioned, something can be targeted in the mouse and never works in the human and doing research with model organisms, even closely related ones, I can tell you that even within the same order, there's no guarantee that these species have um kind of the same there's not the mechanistic processes aren't the same. So I think we need a lot more basic level research to really define what the conserved pathways that drive these processes of say EMT, cell migration, metastasis are, um before we can jump to treating humans and and we have to have both of those at the same time in my opinion.",

So how much do some of these relatively recent um 3D physiologically relevant cell culture models help? So so making basically um so so from you know, my reading and talking to some collaborators it seems like people are getting better at making in vitro models of of the human also for drug testing for example. So does that help maybe avoid some animal models or is that completely often brings along a whole other set of challenges? What's kind of the latest um state of the art there?",

Um we got all kinds of interesting data in addition that I went to go validate with some metabolic imaging, just nothing alike. Not even slightly. And so then we just did all the experiments over again and it told a completely different story. It turned out that, you know, sitting in millimolar glucose, which is what you have to do for the cells to survive, completely wrecked their metabolism in terms of you know, what we're looking for. So it is really easy to get to be misled by those tools. I'm not saying they're bad, but it's very easy to get misled because then you think they're real, but something that's required for the culture conditions um ruins everything. And for someone who works in neuroimmunity, like the microglia that I focus on, they know when they're in culture. They know when they're being looked at and they change their their gene transcription. So those things have been have been very frustrating for for my personal kind of work. Now, they may work in other systems, but they they've never worked for me.",

Uh I have not been following up how well that really translates to the patient's recovery because of course that takes long time to track. Uh but maybe the sensitivity. I know neurons are a beast. They are different in every different environment. So maybe some models are more robust in different um scenarios and that's the thing we could take advantage of.",

What the heck's no, after 10 years of work, that's annoying. So we are we are we're cheating a little bit by uh just focusing right now on repurposing FDA approved drugs that have a huge literature. So the mechanism has been delved into in vitro, in animal models and in humans as much as we can. So um there's a way around that.

Because there you're getting a beta emission, which is killing the actual tumor and then or the thyroid in general and then you're also getting the uh gamma emission that you can detect with the camera. And so, um in my group, um you know, we've been interested in in uh well there's quite a there's quite a lot of efforts out there that are along these lines, especially the nanoparticle community, which can label, you know, things with both therapeutics and diagnostics. My group is stuck on the concept of uh reporter genes. And because GFP's been so critical to, you know, microscopy and biomedical applications and and study, you know, if we could develop good reporter genes for in vivo and human applications, that seems critically important to look at like living drug therapies. So cells that are being regenerative medicine for your cardiac myocytes or um you know, uh car T cells are a modern example, um virally delivered vectors another another example. And so, you know, to me on that front, if you can if you can image the delivery of these types of therapeutics that have different PK because they are tend to um sense and respond to pathology, that makes it a totally different problem than just what the admin characteristics are of a of uh chemotherapy or a biologic.
