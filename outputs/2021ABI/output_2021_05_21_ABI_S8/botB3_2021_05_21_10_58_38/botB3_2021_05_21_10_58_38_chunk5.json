I'm particularly interested in how we can use biological systems to create materials that are more sustainable and that can be produced in a more sustainable way. I'm also really interested in how we can use biological systems to create materials that are more responsive to their environment and that can change their properties in response to changes in temperature, humidity, or light. And I think that that could really open up a lot of new possibilities for the way that we use materials in a variety of applications.",
