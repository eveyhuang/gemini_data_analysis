Meaning how does a single heart muscle cell physically get bigger? And that is one of the main drivers of our lab. Uh and we do attack that in multiple ways and it occurred to us a few years ago, actually about a year ago now that we could use the same technologies we're using to start mimicking what's happening inside of patients in in a in a uh basically a dish. And so we are now developing uh systems to mimic ischemia and reperfusion injury in our cardiac myos and that's allowed us to start doing screening and I have no idea what I'm doing and it's phenomenal. I have we're having a very good time. Uh and so we are kind of all over the place. We're we're looking at individual sarcomeres and we're looking to find some drugs.",

I am a developmental uh molecular and cell biologist and my research focuses on on understanding um the roles of transcription factors and cell cell adhesion molecules in regulating the process of the epithelial to transition. So I study neural crest cells um and those cells are really dynamic and they make a lot of different um adult tissues, but probably more relevant to this group, uh all of the molecular mechanisms that allow those cells to undergo EMT are then re uh reused by cancer cells to metastasize. And so what we are doing in my lab is really trying to get at the basal function of the proteins that allow these cells to undergo EMT and to migrate and differentiate and then um at least my postdoc is really interested in trying to define whether those functions um are conserved in disease states. And so we do a lot of fixed and live imaging of these cells to get at um how the collective migration works um and and the paths that these cells take and then um hopefully how that's affected by perturbations of these different proteins.",

Uh, totally different issues when you start injecting something in the body, whether it's a mouse, a rat or or human. Well, you can't inject in the human before you inject in the mouse and the rat but anyway, so the big issue is how do you how do you get something somewhere where it needs to go? What are the biological barriers that needs to be overcome? Uh, and the biggest question, I guess, you all know that it takes about 10 years to get something from the bench to to being somewhat approved. Not even fully approved, but somewhat approved. 10 years, uh, tens of millions, sometimes hundred millions of dollars. Just just something has to something has to be done about that.

So it is really easy to get to be misled by those tools. I'm not saying they're bad, but it's very easy to get misled because then you think they're real, but something that's required for the culture conditions um ruins everything. And for someone who works in neuroimmunity, like the microglia that I focus on, they know when they're in culture. They know when they're being looked at and they change their their gene transcription. So those things have been have been very frustrating for for my personal kind of work.

You don't have the background when someone says I'm going to put this cell in you is not your cell or it's your cell and I changed it a little bit. That is where we are that's where we're starting from with most of the general public because we're bought in because we know details. And communication is very difficult.
