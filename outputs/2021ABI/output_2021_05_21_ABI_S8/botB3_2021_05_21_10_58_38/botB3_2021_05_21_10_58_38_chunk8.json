Uh you can email me or you can email each other. Please, um and uh hopefully we'll get this going and uh I'm looking forward to forming proposals from you guys. Just think what what you want to do. Um, you have complimentary expertise. Um, so we have a clinical person here. That's unique. So grab his expertise before it's too late.",
