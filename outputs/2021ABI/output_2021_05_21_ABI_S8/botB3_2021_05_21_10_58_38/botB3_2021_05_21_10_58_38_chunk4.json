And I'm just going to kind of kick us off and then hand it over to the other PIs to introduce themselves and maybe say a little bit about what they're going to be doing on the project. So, as you all know, this is a multi-PI, multi-institution project. It's a big project. It's a five-year project. It's a lot of money. So we're all really excited about it. And I think we have a really good team. So I'm really excited to work with all of you. So the goal of this project is to develop a new way to treat heart disease. And the way we're going to do that is by using focused ultrasound to deliver drugs to the heart. And we're going to be using a new type of drug called a small interfering RNA, which is a type of gene therapy. And we're going to be using a new type of focused ultrasound called histotripsy, which is a type of mechanical ablation. So we're going to be combining these three new technologies to develop a new way to treat heart disease. And we're going to be doing that in a pig model of heart disease. So that's kind of the overview of the project. And I'm going to hand it over to the other PIs to introduce themselves and say a little bit about what they're going to be doing on the project.",

And we are going to make sure that these nano materials are safe and they don't have any side effects. So we are going to use a variety of different techniques to assess the safety of these nano materials, including in vitro and in vivo studies. So we are going to use a variety of different cell lines to assess the toxicity of these nano materials. And we are going to use a variety of different animal models to assess the biodistribution and the toxicity of these nano materials. So we are going to make sure that these nano materials are safe and they don't have any side effects.
