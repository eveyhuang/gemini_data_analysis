There's also the idea um from pet because I do pet on some of my day job that you can radio label the drug itself or something that's going to um show you whether or not you're inhibiting with therapeutic doses. So example of this is the estrogen receptor um and people have made drugs like full vestrant which are estrogen receptor degrader. So that drug binds to the estrogen receptor and it's got a hydrophobic group on it that targets the whole receptor to be degraded.",

They have like different properties and all of those things needs also to be considered in the in vitro setting. Like with the advances in the 3D bioprinting and like making like um uh pattern substrates that can basically provide opportunity for cells to basically make a 3D structures rather than like the flat surface uh 2D structured, all of those can be of a great help for getting more meaningful and robust in vitro data. So I think for that purpose maybe a group of scientists that have different looks into the same problem needs to collaborate to each other to basically make a perfect in vitro like setting that can be more close to the in vivo part.",

So what happens is that different types of biomolecules comes to the surface of nanoparticles and interact with them and basically form a corona around the surface of nanoparticles. So based on the type of the proteins, amount of the proteins, conformational changes of the proteins, basically we have totally different fate for the nanoparticles. So it can affect imaging, it can affect targeting, it can affect safety of the nanoparticles and those things basically needs to be considered in the imaging like procedures because you can imagine when you have additional layer at the surface of like nanoparticles, if you use that nanoparticles as a carrier, so what happens is that they can affect drug release.",

So um I'm curious to know how do people image that today because I think using sophisticated nano optics it would be potentially possible to monitor that.",
