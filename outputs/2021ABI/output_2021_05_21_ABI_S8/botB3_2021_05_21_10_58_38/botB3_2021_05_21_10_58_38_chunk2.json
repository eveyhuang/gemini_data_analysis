Uh, I did my PhD in UIUC uh in label free microscopy. And then I did my uh postdoc in Berkeley in computational imaging. So my new lab uh the goal is to see how to use optics and algorithms to enable breakthroughs in biomedicine, especially the clinical adoption of microscopy in different uh biomedical situations like early cancer diagnosis, image guided therapies and neuroimaging. So I'm very interesting this session uh the reason I've never done anything like image guided therapies before, but uh I'm very curious how can I contribute? How can I use label free imaging, how can I use optics and algorithms to enable point of procedure diagnosis uh or point of procedure real time monitoring of the therapeutic process. Uh, what role would a resolution of cellular dynamics mean in the in the process of imaging guided therapies.",

Um so basically the question is we have uh a lot of uh drugs in the pipeline in in uh petri dishes in the labs uh that were beautifully uh when you seed the cells, you know, and then you sprinkle the drug, cells dead, all good. Uh, totally different issues when you start injecting something in the body, whether it's a mouse, a rat or or human. Well, you can't inject in the human before you inject in the mouse and the rat but anyway, so the big issue is how do you how do you get something somewhere where it needs to go? What are the biological barriers that needs to be overcome? Uh, and the biggest question, I guess, you all know that it takes about 10 years to get something from the bench to to being somewhat approved. Not even fully approved, but somewhat approved. 10 years, uh, tens of millions, sometimes hundred millions of dollars. Just just something has to something has to be done about that. So, um, so we're here to to solve this problem today.",
