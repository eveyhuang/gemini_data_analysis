It reduces the Alzheimer's plaque, doesn't do anything else. You still have Alzheimer's, you just don't see the plaques as bad anymore. And so they're image guided biomar, their imaging biomarker was absolutely wrong and they were completely all in on it and they're still trying to get it to work. So so you can really get led astray with these things, yeah.",

We don't know if the Alzheimer's models are accurate. We don't know if Alzheimer's plaques that you see are anyway like related directly to Alzheimer's in humans. Uh human patients often have Alzheimer's plaques. They often have Alzheimer's plaques and no Alzheimer's. They sometimes have no plaques and Alzheimer's.

So it was worth pursuing because they were getting good data here and they could see their imaging biomarker in humans work. But it turned out or",

Like inject me, go for it, but um so there have to there has to be a a front of us being the scientists and the clinicians and also explaining how important and innocuous some of these things can be. They can be helpful. They can be, you know, therapeutic. They can also be um diagnostic but or theragnostics, right? That's the the term. But",

Yeah. And the response is it can't because it's investigational as an imaging and diagnostic it will not change your management at all. The difference for the therapy folks is they're like we don't know. We're going to see it might help you. And so that's a huge like just big difference between therapeutic intervention trials and like diagnostic like, you know, approaches. Yeah. But but what I really don't think about as scientists often to uh is is is scary as hell. You don't have the background when someone says I'm going to put this cell in you is not your cell or it's your cell and I changed it a little bit. That is where we are that's where we're starting from with most of the general public because we're bought in because we know details. And communication is very difficult. We don't even pay science communicators very much. They they barely even exist to be honest. They're all freelancers out there. Um and so I I I I I'm afraid that that's going to fall on us.",
