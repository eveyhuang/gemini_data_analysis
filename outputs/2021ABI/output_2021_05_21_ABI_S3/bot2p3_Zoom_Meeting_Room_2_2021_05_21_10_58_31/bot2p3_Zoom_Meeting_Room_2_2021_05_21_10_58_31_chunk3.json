Um so I'm like kind of on the cusp of being a new investigator I guess. Um but um my research is primarily focused on um sort of like the development and application of uh intravital optical microscopy tools. So both like uh fluorescence and um as well as multiphoton like non linear scattering. So second harmonic generation and then moving towards third harmonic generation. Um and um we're kind of interested in understanding like the organel level activities. So if we can see the dynamics of cells um as they're functioning as they're activated by injury and regeneration processes um inside mostly we've been looking at the bone. Um but you know bone and muscle and other tissues. Um and um so we're working on strategies to enhance the penetration depth by moving towards like the NIR2 window um hopefully soon. Um and then uh also doing scattering correction to try to bring back our point spread function. Um as well as doing um uh some super resolution type techniques that we're heading there um to try to understand um you know get down to that organel level uh resolution um in a dynamic setting. Um was like ISM related stuff. Um and uh uh so yeah with the goal of understanding how, you know, the regenerative processes um of cells and um I guess so I guess the um for label free wise second harmonic generation, you know, is really sensitive um to collagen molecules which are very present in the bone and other tissues, cancer, etcetera and to the orientation of them. So you can both look at, you know, the organization of collagen features. Um just strictly speaking it also a polarization component that can be used uh potentially, although it's more challenging in scattering tissues. Um and then third harmonic is primarily sensitive to refractive index, nice little things as well as like size and shape but but predominantly refractive index. Um and um I guess we have another branch that also is doing a little bit of uh phase related imaging um uh trying to look at forgraphy to understand uh bone stem cells and how they grow and can be expanded and used as a therapeutic and how they respond to challenge. So um I guess uh Alex.",

Um but we use quantitative fluorescence imaging to look at both the intensity and the lifetime of NADH and FAD for label free imaging of cell metabolism. And then our applications are looking at things like drug response um of cancer. So drugs can alter the cell metabolism and we can use that to tell if the can if the drugs will work for different cancer patients and like uh preorganoids and ex size samples.",

For example, the um you know, we can make very small tag so that we can label small molecules and that way we can uh enhance the sensitivity and also the specificity of small molecule detection. Uh another approach we uh worked on is to increase the multiplexity. So I think uh we just mentioned that Rama, I mean fluorescence can only limited to uh seven just just mentioned uh fluorescence typically limited to four colors. But Rama can go significantly beyond that uh but because of the linewidth. So we engineered uh Raman probes that has very very sharp lines and then we make them uh all resolve from each other. So we can have a library of well resolved Raman uh probes then we can image them uh simultaneously. So the current uh we can we can go up to like 20 colors at the same time. So that's something I think Rama can really go beyond fluorescence. Again, because of the new probes we introduced.",

So typically if it's uh let's say give you example if it's a triple bond, carbon carbon triple bond or carbon nitrogen triple bond because of the electron density on the bond are higher than the regular single bond or double double bond. So the ability change upon like citation is high, so that will typically leads to high cross section.",
