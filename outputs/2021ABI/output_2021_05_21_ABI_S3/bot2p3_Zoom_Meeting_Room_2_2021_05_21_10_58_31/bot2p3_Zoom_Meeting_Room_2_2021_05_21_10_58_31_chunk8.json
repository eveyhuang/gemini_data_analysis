Um and the way they interfere with themselves is by placing them at very specific like uh different types of lattice um um orientation. So um and that will allow us to tune or control the propagation land that will allow us to tune or control basically the thinness of the light sheet. Um so effectively what that means I mean in a in a in a uh actual application sense is that um unlike a Gaussian um light sheet, you more or less have um a region of the light sheet that is um propagation invariant uh meaning that as it's traversing through your sample, it's not converging or diverging. Um uh and and that basically means that we have more or less uh uniform uh point spread functions throughout the propagation um of your of your basically non-diffracting region of the light sheet. Um and the benefit of all of this is that it allows us to do quantitative um subcellular imaging specifically in the context of, you know, looking at subcellular dynamics again to the diffraction limit, right?

So we basically measure what the isoplanatic patch is and then kind of do that on an average D scan like uh volumetric uh sense. So um yeah, so you may have to do it pixel by pixel if your isoplanatic patch is basically just infinitesimally small, right? Um but our corrections are usually on the order of maybe about 20 to 30 micrometer uh cube volumes like 20 by 20 by 20 ish. Um and that of course depends really on the tissue and the sample that we're using, right? So something with a large curvature uh Snell's law kind of comes into play. So um we have to do smaller corrections.",

Because uh because the the light sheet just because the configuration of the objectives, we use lower NA objectives than um than typical confocal microscopes, right? So you would better, you know, be able to get better lateral resolution with like a spinning disc confocal or something like that, but it's not very amenable to do uh time lapse three-dimensional volumetric imaging whereas the light sheet is, right? So it really is again, I I'm always of the view that, you know, best tool for the the question at hand. So if your question is um related to dynamics, um it's hard to kind of get to a a point where you can do volumetric imaging with the canonical like gold standard microscopes that most you know, biology labs or core facilities at the moment have, right?",
