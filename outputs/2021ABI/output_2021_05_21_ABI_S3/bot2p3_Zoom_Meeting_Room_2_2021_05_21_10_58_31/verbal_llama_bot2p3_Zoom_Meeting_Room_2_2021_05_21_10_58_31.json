So you can both look at, you know, the organization of collagen features. Um just strictly speaking it also a polarization component that can be used uh potentially, although it's more challenging in scattering tissues. Um and then third harmonic is primarily sensitive to refractive index, nice little things as well as like size and shape but but predominantly refractive index.

So we can have a library of well resolved Raman uh probes then we can image them uh simultaneously. So the current uh we can we can go up to like 20 colors at the same time.

Um uh and and that basically means that we have more or less uh uniform uh point spread functions throughout the propagation um of your of your basically non-diffracting region of the light sheet.

Because uh because the the light sheet just because the configuration of the objectives, we use lower NA objectives than um than typical confocal microscopes, right?
