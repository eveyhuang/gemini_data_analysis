So you can both look at, you know, the organization of collagen features. Um just strictly speaking it also a polarization component that can be used uh potentially, although it's more challenging in scattering tissues. Um and then third harmonic is primarily sensitive to refractive index, nice little things as well as like size and shape but but predominantly refractive index. Um and um I guess we have another branch that also is doing a little bit of uh phase related imaging um uh trying to look at forgraphy to understand uh bone stem cells and how they grow and can be expanded and used as a therapeutic and how they respond to challenge.

Um but our corrections are usually on the order of maybe about 20 to 30 micrometer uh cube volumes like 20 by 20 by 20 ish.

So you would better, you know, be able to get better lateral resolution with like a spinning disc confocal or something like that, but it's not very amenable to do uh time lapse three-dimensional volumetric imaging whereas the light sheet is, right?
