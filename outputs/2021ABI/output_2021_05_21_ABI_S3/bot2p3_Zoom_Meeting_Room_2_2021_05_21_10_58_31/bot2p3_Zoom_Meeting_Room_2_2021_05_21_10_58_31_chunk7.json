Um, but the interpretation um is just needs to be kind of, you know, made sure that, you know, just because you have access to this new information, the new insights you're drawing can also be kind of, you know, in the context of the biological question makes sense and is interpretable, right?",

Um, uh, one of the things I I so in I think something that's very specific to the phase imaging community is that I think our validation systems can be or our validation protocol might be a little bit um a little bit uh distinct in the sense that uh we can't we actually a lot of times we will actually fabricate these um these these samples that have um features, so electron beam microscopy has way more resolution than anything that we'll ever do, right? So we use the um we get the really high high resolution uh essentially profile of the sample and if you and phase is supposed to give you the optical path delay as it travels to the sample, right? As the light travels to the sample. So if you know the physical dimensions of the sample as fabricated by the electron beam system, then that typically gives you a gold standard phase distribution and so that we usually use that to match our phase reconstructions.",

So essentially we're reporting the number of chemical bonds in the sample. So that's what we can report. And of course, how to translate that into a concentration or into, you know, how much what's the milligram of the molecules that that needs some simple chemical conversion, but I think the the whole the whole chain of the calculation is very very very very quantitative.",
