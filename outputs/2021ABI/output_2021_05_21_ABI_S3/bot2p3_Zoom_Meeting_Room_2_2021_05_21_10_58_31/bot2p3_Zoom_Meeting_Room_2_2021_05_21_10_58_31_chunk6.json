Um, because I mean even things like uh reflectance confocal microscopy which have been around for like ages, you know, are um provide a ton of information and people are still struggling with how to make that meaningful for for others to use, you know, like people are trying to I don't know, create like H and E variants so you can look at the skin and have like a live H and E stain really look around, you know, like a and other people like that. Um, so it seems like there's just like this spectrum of opportunity.",

But of course, it's not going to be the same thing because when we use microscopy to measure lipids is more like a a specially resolved very small uh amount. But if you use GCMS, it's not going to be a single cell type of thing, you need a large quantity of samples. But there is a there is a you know, there is a commonality here, you can actually compare. So we do we do that in some of our uh work just to see, okay, if this particular say animal has a high lipid content in the cells, we also see that if we do traditional uh biochemistry. But microscopy often offer higher resolution. So that's something that there's nothing to validate about because this is this is exactly why we do this, right? So if everything can be validated by other techniques, there's no benefit of doing this anymore. So so you can you can validate about some of the aspects, maybe, you know, ensemble or some basic level, but there's definitely something that I I believe something that cannot be validated by any other thing. So that's the whole community has to, you know, have to somehow trust that data and then you know, we can test that later on by other methods.",
