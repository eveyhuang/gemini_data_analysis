Uh so basically all um our all methods that we're using are hydrogel based um by making tissues optically transparent and then either get a volumetric image uh of an organism or um get a super resolution image uh by expanding uh the samples. Uh for for this particular session here since it's label free imaging, we were we ran into an issue um because if you do fluorescence microscopy imaging, you only have uh so many channels available, right?

Um but um my research is primarily focused on um sort of like the development and application of uh intravital optical microscopy tools. So both like uh fluorescence and um as well as multiphoton like non linear scattering. So second harmonic generation and then moving towards third harmonic generation. Um and um we're kind of interested in understanding like the organel level activities. So if we can see the dynamics of cells um as they're functioning as they're activated by injury and regeneration processes um inside mostly we've been looking at the bone. Um but you know bone and muscle and other tissues. Um and um so we're working on strategies to enhance the penetration depth by moving towards like the NIR2 window um hopefully soon. Um and then uh also doing scattering correction to try to bring back our point spread function. Um as well as doing um uh some super resolution type techniques that we're heading there um to try to understand um you know get down to that organel level uh resolution um in a dynamic setting. Um was like ISM related stuff. Um and uh uh so yeah with the goal of understanding how, you know, the regenerative processes um of cells and um I guess so I guess the um for label free wise second harmonic generation, you know, is really sensitive um to collagen molecules which are very present in the bone and other tissues, cancer, etcetera and to the orientation of them. So you can both look at, you know, the organization of collagen features. Um just strictly speaking it also a polarization component that can be used uh potentially, although it's more challenging in scattering tissues. Um and then third harmonic is primarily sensitive to refractive index, nice little things as well as like size and shape but but predominantly refractive index. Um and um I guess we have another branch that also is doing a little bit of uh phase related imaging um uh trying to look at forgraphy to understand uh bone stem cells and how they grow and can be expanded and used as a therapeutic and how they respond to challenge.

For example, the um you know, we can make very small tag so that we can label small molecules and that way we can uh enhance the sensitivity and also the specificity of small molecule detection. Uh another approach we uh worked on is to increase the multiplexity. So I think uh we just mentioned that Rama, I mean fluorescence can only limited to uh seven just just mentioned uh fluorescence typically limited to four colors. But Rama can go significantly beyond that uh but because of the linewidth. So we engineered uh Raman probes that has very very sharp lines and then we make them uh all resolve from each other. So we can have a library of well resolved Raman uh probes then we can image them uh simultaneously. So the current uh we can we can go up to like 20 colors at the same time.

Um and the way they interfere with themselves is by placing them at very specific like uh different types of lattice um um orientation. So um and that will allow us to tune or control the propagation land that will allow us to tune or control basically the thinness of the light sheet. Um so effectively what that means I mean in a in a in a uh actual application sense is that um unlike a Gaussian um light sheet, you more or less have um a region of the light sheet that is um propagation invariant uh meaning that as it's traversing through your sample, it's not converging or diverging. Um uh and and that basically means that we have more or less uh uniform uh point spread functions throughout the propagation um of your of your basically non-diffracting region of the light sheet. Um and the benefit of all of this is that it allows us to do quantitative um subcellular imaging specifically in the context of, you know, looking at subcellular dynamics again to the diffraction limit, right?

So um yeah, so you may have to do it pixel by pixel if your isoplanatic patch is basically just infinitesimally small, right? Um but our corrections are usually on the order of maybe about 20 to 30 micrometer uh cube volumes like 20 by 20 by 20 ish.

Because uh because the the light sheet just because the configuration of the objectives, we use lower NA objectives than um than typical confocal microscopes, right? So you would better, you know, be able to get better lateral resolution with like a spinning disc confocal or something like that, but it's not very amenable to do uh time lapse three-dimensional volumetric imaging whereas the light sheet is, right? So it really is again, I I'm always of the view that, you know, best tool for the the question at hand.
