So they often want to see that um very specific information. And uh I guess that is a a question um if you know, we can address that would be the best. Um yeah, so I'm also trying to see if if some of you have any um way a way out for that. I mean, what I do is I'm trying to convince them. Um, you know, sometimes you don't need to see um very specific um type of molecule. Um, what is more uh essential or things that you know, other techniques cannot measure is um, you know, even though even if we can see, you know, uh unsaturation ratio in lupus versus the um saturated ratio in a spatial dependent and a very fast temporal dependent manner, that will be actually very useful for biology. That's I think that's the thing I'm trying to convince biologist that I know. Um, but you know, I get that question a lot, you know, what specific proteins we can image.
