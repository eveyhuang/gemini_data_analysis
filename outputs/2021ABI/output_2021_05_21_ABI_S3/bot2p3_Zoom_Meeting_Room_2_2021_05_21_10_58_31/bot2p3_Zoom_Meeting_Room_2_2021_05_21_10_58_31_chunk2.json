Um, and we're basically working on the next generation of that to bridge together about seven different microscopes squeezed into one. So you basically have more or less um all of the the optical elements reusable or reconfigurable. Um, and then the other arm of the the lab is to develop some computational tools to be able to um mine or basically extract biologically relevant insights from these, you know, multi terabyte to almost of a quarter of a petabyte um uh projects that we've worked on in the past. So it's been maybe uh half a uh decade since we've done the first um uh adaptive optical um data set generations and we're still kind of working on mining these um these these data sets.
