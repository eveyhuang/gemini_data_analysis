        "utterance": "Barbara Smith, ASU: Yeah, so we do it's electrophysiology. So um the micropipette electrode um was developed I think it's around the 1960s and um they record neuronal activity. It's a high resolution recording of typically single neurons um and their activity level um with the with the um basically I won't go into detail. Um so the electrode is placed into the brain and um it's typically done either um blind or um using optical microscopy approaches from from external sources. So uh a microscope on the outside. And and so what ends up happening is if you have um if you work with this blind, you would use like probably a DIC microscope and um you can do this in vivo and the electrode is placed in and uh positive pressure is is pushed into the electrode as it's moved through the brain tissue so that that electrode doesn't get clogged. The tip of the electrode is about um one to three microns in diameter and that electrode is is moved little very very very slowly into the brain um and there's no way to target selective cells of interest using the blind approach, but you can get deeper, right? So um the only way the most basic way that they know that they've hit a cell of interest is by creating a connection between that electrode and that cell. So they place it from a positive pressure and then we make a negative pressure from that. We create a bleb, so it sucks up part of that membrane of the cell. Um we um increase the pressure and it opens up the cell membrane so that there's a direct connection between that electrode and the fluids within the electrode and the cell um solution. And and what ends up happening is the um it ends up being able to record that cell, but you don't know what cell you're hitting until you start recording it. And if you've started recording the wrong cell, you have to remove that micropipette electrode um throw it out, place a new one in and then enter into the brain one more time. And so uh it's kind of a hunt and peck process. You can get deeper and people can record very well uh neuroscientists have been recording like that for for decades. Um but lately with two photon microscopy, you can get down to about a millimeter and you can genetically alter or place in different kinds of dyes and and selectively target neurons up to a millimeter. But past the millimeter from the cortical surface, um there are minimal ways to do it. So you can suction out a portion of the brain. Um that's one way to do it and then the animal is still alive and you can move down um and you can do within a millimeter of whatever area you've sectioned. Um or if you're coming from the top, you can see cells about within a millimeter of of where that surface is. If you're exceptional if you're doing three photon or multi photon, you can get maybe two millimeters. Um it's a little bit rough. Um but the way that we're doing this is oh oh is we're integrating light and sound into that micropipette electrode so you don't need a microscope on the outside to guide that cell. And so um we can get uh stains and genetic um uh genetic contrast throughout the brain and now we can we can tap into cells um of interest at at depths beyond one millimeter as deep as that. So we're combining um blind and an imaging guided approach by doing this, but without the microscope on the outside. Hope that made sense. ",
