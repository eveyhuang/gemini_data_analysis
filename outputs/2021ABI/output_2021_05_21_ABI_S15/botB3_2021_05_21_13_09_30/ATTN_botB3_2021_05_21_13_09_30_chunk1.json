And I'm really looking forward to working with all of you. So, I think we should just jump right in and get started. So, I think the first thing we should do is just go around and introduce ourselves and say a little bit about our backgrounds and what we're interested in. So, I'll start. I'm Brad Smith. I'm a professor at Notre Dame. I'm interested in all things related to science and technology. And I'm really excited about this project because I think it has the potential to make a real difference in the world. So, that's me.",
