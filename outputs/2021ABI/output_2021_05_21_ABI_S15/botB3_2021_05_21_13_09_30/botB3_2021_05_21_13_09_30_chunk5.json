            "transcript": "Hi everyone, so I'm going to talk about the first part of the project, which is the total synthesis of the target molecule. So, as you can see, the target molecule is a complex natural product with multiple chiral centers and a unique ring system. So, the first step is to identify the key building blocks and the disconnections that will allow us to access the molecule in a convergent manner. So, we're thinking about using a combination of asymmetric catalysis and protecting group chemistry to control the stereochemistry and the reactivity of the different functional groups. So, we're also considering using a ring-closing metathesis reaction to form the unique ring system. So, we're still in the early stages of planning, but we're excited about the potential of this project.",
