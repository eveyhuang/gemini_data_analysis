We're beginning the obviously by the third breakout session and all of this stuff beginning to know each other pretty well. So, uh, I'll just read them out here. Well, let me I've already introduced. Oh man, I'm a chemistry based person and optical imaging is primarily what I do. So the lack of deep tissue imaging is the problem I'm trying to avoid or trying to get around. Uh, but let's just see what other modalities that we've got there. So, um, Anarude, maybe start with you because you're you're not eating.",

One is, you know, throw more more photons at it and get deeper. Um, two is you are in a light sheet type uh context then, you know, do some uh holography for shaping of beams.
