Um, and so the the problem we'll run into though with deep tissue imaging is sensitivity. Um, so if you had a genetic reporter, you're not likely generating sufficient concentrations at depth that you would have the sensitivity necessary to detect it. Um, you know, we think a lot though about redesigning our systems for improved signal to noise, you know, improved light delivery, you know, and all of those things can work in your favor when you're trying to really push the limits on sensitivity, but we obviously have some big goals and big challenges.",

I'm wondering for photoacoustic imaging, you know, I hear a lot about detecting hemoglobin and I assume that's because it's very concentrated and has sort of spectral properties that are that are easy to detect using a photoacoustic imaging. What other kinds of molecules can you detect and um, yeah, what is the kind of specificity?",

So if a molecule is not as good at emitting, it takes in a certain wavelength and it's very good for photoacoustics at that point because then that heat is a that energy is absorbed, it gets excited and then it can produce a photoacoustic response more than a fluorescent response. So you can use a molecule that's not very good um at a at being fluorescent, you can still use it for fluorescence but it's not so good um but you can also generate a photoacoustic effect from it.",

So melanin absorbs, everything absorbs. So it's a big challenge to actually figure out where your signal is uh if your signal is coming from where you want it to be. And and that's where targeted contrast agents they really help. So everything, like every part of our body is talking all the time. So whenever you're exposed to light, they are generating tiny bit of acoustic signal, so it's almost like talking.",

And so we've integrated like an optical and acoustic system into that so that they can have visual guidance and eyes where they're currently going in blind. And so um how we um re I I would say um reposition the light as we go at a 90 degree angle, we'll we'll place an optical fiber in with um with some kind of redirection. And so we can get um both optics and acoustics coming from the surrounding area so we can look for different different things both endogenous, so like um that hemoglobin and and different kinds of areas where there's increased vasculature um and acoustic information as well and they're also doing transactional ultrasounds.
