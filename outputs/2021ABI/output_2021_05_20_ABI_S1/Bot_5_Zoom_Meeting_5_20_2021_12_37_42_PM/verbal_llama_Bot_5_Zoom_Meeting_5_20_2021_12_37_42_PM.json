Um and what happens uh when you are using whatever modality you're using to to detect the object which changes um potentially the um uh it it's properties which now does not allow you to be able to record it. So for example when you're doing like QPI or some sort of phase imaging, you know, it's tracking the refractive index changes um in these in these images, but um uh even though the object is present, but it changes its kind of uh physical like bending properties, you're no longer able to detect it from a uh label free context.
