And when I was writing it down, I wrote down, you know, microreology in bacterial cells and how this spatial heterogeneity will affect to multiple different particle tracking and in terms of understanding how they interact in different spatial context, different polymeric network as you say. This is not really, when you think about it, it's so many things are floating, it's just so crowded. In that crowded spatial media, can we deduce, you know, reology of a really simplistic cells and can we decouple that.",

It's not particle tracking per se. It's more just trying to get a, you know, like a metabolic view of the cell. And with the Raman stuff, we've got a group that's working on surface enhanced Raman probes, which I think could potentially be tagged to to molecules. But what we've like it's just I I'd interested if anybody's actually gone further with Raman. We can't get around the integration time. So to study fast things, we just have to integrate for so long that it's not really a particle tracking thing. It might be more of a a cell migration type time scale on the minutes kind of time scale, but on this the second particle tracking in a cell type stuff, we haven't we haven't been able to do it. We we can characterize lipids and and DNA and things like that and mitochondria produce a pretty strong Raman signal.",

But uh at least at like at the nano site part of view when I basically try to tag other type of nanoparticles with a small molecules, what I see is that like the interaction of proteins with the surface of these nanoparticles gets changed.
