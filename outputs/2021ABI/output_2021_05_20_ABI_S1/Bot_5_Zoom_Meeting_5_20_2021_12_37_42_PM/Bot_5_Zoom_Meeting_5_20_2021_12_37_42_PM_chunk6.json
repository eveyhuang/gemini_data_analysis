   "transcript": "Yeah, I think that was one of the most interesting things about your talk, Shin, was the the the modeling of being three to four orders of magnitude different than what was observed for the cyclic AMP diffusion. So I think one way to start is to just do those back of the envelope calculations with the observed data and say, well, what would need to be the diffusion constant to match that? I think that's a very kind of simple thing that we we could do with a lot of the particles that we've already tracked and measured is to just say like, you know, what constraints must be imposed to slow this thing down to the observed rate. Um, and that could be, you know, the polymeric nature of the cytosol, it could be a lot of different things. So I thought that was a, you know, maybe maybe simple modeling is is one way to just approach it from from the ground up.",
