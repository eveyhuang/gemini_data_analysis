Um and what happens uh when you are using whatever modality you're using to to detect the object which changes um potentially the um uh it it's properties which now does not allow you to be able to record it. So for example when you're doing like QPI or some sort of phase imaging, you know, it's tracking the refractive index changes um in these in these images, but um uh even though the object is present, but it changes its kind of uh physical like bending properties, you're no longer able to detect it from a uh label free context.

But with something like QPI, I mean, can you combine QPI with, you know, some of these new more sensitive reporters and just really go very, very low on the fluorescent side. So go low excitation, very, very fast detection times and then combine the QPI readout with fluorescence to facilitate some of these things.

But the challenge there is again, I'm thinking from like the bias of tracking individual proteins, um this relies on sparse labeling. So you're labeling maybe 1% of the proteins that you're tracking. Um and then you label 1% of one protein in red and 1% of another protein in green, even if they're interacting, how do you really know they're interacting if you only label 1% of each um population.",

It's not particle tracking per se. It's more just trying to get a, you know, like a metabolic view of the cell. And with the Raman stuff, we've got a group that's working on surface enhanced Raman probes, which I think could potentially be tagged to to molecules. But what we've like it's just I I'd interested if anybody's actually gone further with Raman. We can't get around the integration time. So to study fast things, we just have to integrate for so long that it's not really a particle tracking thing. It might be more of a a cell migration type time scale on the minutes kind of time scale, but on this the second particle tracking in a cell type stuff, we haven't we haven't been able to do it. We we can characterize lipids and and DNA and things like that and mitochondria produce a pretty strong Raman signal.",
