So while there's some inline analysis, so you know, a radiologist can sit at the scanner and see peaks and get approximate idea of patterns. Um, it's not 100% quantitative, it's not standardized across sites. Um, I guess that's those are big medical imaging questions separately even from metabolism is um, are those limitations.",

So in the spirit of lowest possible perturbation and something that's amplifiable, not just, oh, it it's bound to like A bound to B and that's definitely not going to be easy to detect. So I don't know if it's possible, but if we can think of it a way to, you know, bring this aptamer or nucleic acid based binding event and lead that into some amplification event so that we have dynamic range to read out rare metabolite that could be of interest can be an interesting direction.",

You're always only increasing never, you know, playing with the the kinetics to have unbinding of the metabolite that you're you're sensing and and bringing the signal back down. So, you know, depending on the the uh dynamics of what the the molecule that you're trying to sense, it could be that you want that accumulation of signal um just to see it at all or you might want a a reversible signal so that you see the the uptick and then the the decline of the reduction in the concentration of that metabolite um in response to something.
