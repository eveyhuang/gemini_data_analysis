Uh just as a reminder what my background is uh chemistry and specifically um synthesis of mainly optical based probes. We do a little bit of pet and now some ultrasound as well. Um but mainly yeah trying to develop agents that can report on specific biological signatures namely proteolytic signatures is what we do a lot of. Um not we don't do that much metabolite stuff but we we are starting to get interested more in lipid metabolites as well. Um so I I think it's easiest if I just call out people looking around the top of my screen here so maybe start with Molly. I know you're eating sorry.",
