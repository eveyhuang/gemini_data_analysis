Um not we don't do that much metabolite stuff but we we are starting to get interested more in lipid metabolites as well.

Our my lab is developing optical imaging techniques such as SRS and multifoton fluorescence microscopy. So we have been integrating two imaging modalities together to visualize the metabolic activities in living living organisms. So there are two layers of of imaging approach. One is the label free including the fluorescence multifoton fluorescence for example, we look at the NADH or flavor molecules in the living organism. And another layer is the Raman label free approach that we can visualize those lipids and protein information inside the animals and tissues. And we also want to separate the new molecules, uh newly synthesized molecule from the older endogenous molecules. So we have been also label those metabolites such as using heavy water or deterium labeled glucose amino acids to probe the metabolic activities in the live animals. So uh in that case we can separate those new molecules from the older molecules and uh quantitatively image the metabolic turnover rate for each of the macro molecules in the in the body. And uh very glad to discuss with you all today. Thank you.",

You're always only increasing never, you know, playing with the the kinetics to have unbinding of the metabolite that you're you're sensing and and bringing the signal back down. So, you know, depending on the the uh dynamics of what the the molecule that you're trying to sense, it could be that you want that accumulation of signal um just to see it at all or you might want a a reversible signal so that you see the the uptick and then the the decline of the reduction in the concentration of that metabolite um in response to something.

Um, the other thing is out of the prompts that we started with, the idea that metabolic changes proceed physiological changes, I think when we're looking at the brain and and we are using physiological measures of um, well what I would call physiological measures, we're using vascular properties to estimate a metabolic property. So the timeline of things is really important when we try to infer one from the other. So in the pathologies, knowing when we can trust our models of how vascular signals relate to metabolism or when those models have already broken down because metabolism wrecked that something about the vascular thing we're measuring. I'm not sure I'm being very coherent, but I feel like it's it's a big challenge that like with a lot of things with this neuro MRI view of metabolism, I feel like we're we're a bit superficial with it so far.",
