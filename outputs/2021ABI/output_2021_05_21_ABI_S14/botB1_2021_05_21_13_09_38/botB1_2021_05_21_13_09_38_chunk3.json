Uh, one of which is this kind of spatial resolution of metabolism and so, you know, a lot of the approaches that we have on the cell biology side in terms of, you know, broad population level metabolomics are not sufficient for a lot of the questions that apparently everyone in this group is is similarly thinking about in terms of the spatial organization in 3D and in a tissue where oxygen gradients, pH gradients, nutrient availability might be very altered and so this this ability to get it at spatial organization of metabolism within a cell, within tissue, within an organism I think is is really important and we need to think about the the needs there and then um, you know, I I think it's fascinating that you want subpixel um information there. That is just blows my mind because we can't even get, you know, reasonable dynamic measurements in a single cell sometimes and so the idea that you could have that kind of of uh resolution is is really interesting to me.",

What is the what is the need in terms of probes in terms of to make these kind of leaps from maps or measurements to diagnosis to phenotype to um outcome.",

I I love the idea of using mass spectrometry to look at the metabolomic processes, but as many of you pointed out, it's a very small scale problem. So we can also imagine using expansion microscopy, but then you have to think of a way to anchor your molecules of interest in a reliable way so that it flies. So have anyone, you know, read anything about it and, you know, any experiences I would love to talk about it.",

Um yeah, I guess the question is, you know, how do you integrate those technologies into something that's a reasonable diagnostic workflow for for like a clinical specimen or are we talking about samples that would be biopsied or where where do you guys see the application in metabolic profiling?",

For example, the the brain tumor case. So for the brain tumor removal, the surgeon will just take take out the just open the skull and take out the brain tumor and they usually will do assess on that uh scar wall inside the brain to to see if there's any tumor cell left inside the brain. So the traditional or conventional way is to just take a little very little tiny piece out and do the histology image H and E staining to to check if the cell uh are all brain cells and there's no tumor cells left inside. So then we can close the skull and wake up the patient.",

            "transcript": "But usually it takes the conventional method usually takes too long and uh maybe a few hours so that the patient will be under anesthesia for a few hours waiting for the results. But now um since SRS allow us to visualize the protein and the lipids very rapidly. Well for example I I I take like five minutes to take the image when you have that piece of tissue and immediately you have the digital H and E maybe H and E and the pathologist can look at the H image in a few minutes and determine if there's tumor still left or not. So it saves a few hours and uh the patient can be wake up very soon um not they they don't need to be under anesthesia for that long. So it's kind of protecting the brain. Also it's it's a biopsy. It's a it's a diagnostic biopsy um during the clinical clinical clinical period. So I think that types of like fast rapid diagnostic molecular level determination of based on the imaging technology such as SRS may uh be helpful.",

That's a very big problem and people trying to solve this problem for 20 years still not successful. Um because of limited uh special resolution and also the sensitivity we use. We have been tried with the MRI mostly and some people tried pet. So that's why people trying to uh combine the pet MRI uh to complement each other to increase the uh sensitivity and the special resolution. Um in creating um like receptor imaging also it's a big big part for the metabolic imaging. Um example for that is the GLP1 glucagon like peptide one.
