Um, the yeah, I I'd say that with my type of MRI, we um, we say we want metabolism, but what we typically are saying is we want neural activity. And that's such a different thing and yet we say it and and that's sort of a mindset issue. Um, the other thing is out of the prompts that we started with, the idea that metabolic changes proceed physiological changes, I think when we're looking at the brain and and we are using physiological measures of um, well what I would call physiological measures, we're using vascular properties to estimate a metabolic property. So the timeline of things is really important when we try to infer one from the other. So in the pathologies, knowing when we can trust our models of how vascular signals relate to metabolism or when those models have already broken down because metabolism wrecked that something about the vascular thing we're measuring. I'm not sure I'm being very coherent, but I feel like it's it's a big challenge that like with a lot of things with this neuro MRI view of metabolism, I feel like we're we're a bit superficial with it so far.",

And uh, understanding the relationship between the molecules you're detecting and right your physiological outcome that you want to to actually know something about is is an important bridge that needs to be crossed. Um, so like when you do autofluorescence of NADH and FAD, we're very good at finding those molecules, but we're not so great at knowing what that tells us about metabolism. Um, and so I think that's that's the challenge for the field that I work in is trying to be more specific with things like metabolic pathways.",
