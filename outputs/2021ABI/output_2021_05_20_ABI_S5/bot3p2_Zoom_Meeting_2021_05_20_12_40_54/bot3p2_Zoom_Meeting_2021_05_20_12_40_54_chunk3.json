Since like protein synthesis, DNA synthesis all requires water. So if you deuterate water into a heavy water, the deuterium bond will actually participate in all those synthetic pathways and eventually will end up in the biological molecules. And um and the carbon deuterium bond is well known to be Raman active. So we use that as a reporter or sensor, depending how you call it, uh to look at, you know, synthetic activities of cells, tissues or even animals and we can extract all those metabolic activity information. So this is something I think are beyond what fluorescence can do, but it's also but it's really at the hybrid between label free imaging and some sort of label imaging. So I think this is uh uh some sort of interfacial area is something that is very exciting about. So that is the one example.",
