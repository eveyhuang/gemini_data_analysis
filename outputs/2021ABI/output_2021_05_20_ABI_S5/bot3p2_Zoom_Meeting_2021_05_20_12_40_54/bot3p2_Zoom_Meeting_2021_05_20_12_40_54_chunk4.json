Uh and this has been shown in microfluidics, but there I think mini's part really comes in that if you want to image this in vivo, then you'll have you know, in the depth of the body, many multiple scattering effects. So how can you filter those out in a clever way, um for instance, getting rid of background signals, um and there for instance, there are some studies that use uh nanoparticles that are up converting. So for instance, you excite them with infrared light, which can go deeper into the tissue and they emit fluorescent light. So so there are um some approaches like that to address the depth issue as well.",

Um, scatter, of course, you know, again, how do you get isolate the signal becomes a challenge once you start talking about thicker tissue. Uh but I guess to the community here with Raman scattering, what is the um I guess current currently what is the thickness of samples that uh people have been working on? I've been curious about that.",

So uh it's probably on the order of 50 to 100 micron. And uh for non linear Raman that uses uh uh near infrared light uh to coherently excite the molecules, the penetration can probably go down to 500 micron uh 500 microns. And there's a uh a different type of Raman microscopy, it's actually not microscopy, it's more like a tomography, it's called the spatially offset Raman spectroscopy. So they use uh uh they use light to propagate and then use a different and move the excitation source to to measure the propagated light again. So from the different uh light propagating back through the tissue, they can infer the depth information. So that has substantially uh deeper penetration. It's probably on the order of millimeter to centimeter. But uh but again, by doing so you lose spatial resolution. There's always a trade off between spatial resolution and the penetration. So so that type of Raman spatially offset Raman has the highest penetration depths of maybe centimeter, but the the spatial resolution is relatively poor.",

            "transcript": "I I want to add one thing that uh for uh scatter so uh we are working on this X-ray system where I am not using like for the interferometry I am not using analyzer which stops a lot of the long angle scatter automatically. So one for me the challenge is to actually remove the long angle scatter so that it doesn't interfere with the small angle scatter. You know like the small angle scatter resides in the first harmonic and the you know the the baseline has the small long angle scatter. So there are lots of methodologies as you know that to remove scatter and we have been very successful with MLM for thicknesses as thick as a breast. Okay so like you can clear a lot of that but mainly it's for the first harmonic like attenuation image it's not the zero harmonic image it's not the small angle with the interferometry the small angle scatter will be in a very different zone. So it will be automatically not having the long angle the the Compton scatter for X-rays you know um or the you know for in for um the in the inelastic scattering for neutrons it won't be interfering with the small angle scatter information if that's what we are looking for. I just throwing it out there that that you know that it's a pretty clean method to get the small angle scatter image and also um if we are I know you you are looking to answer better biological questions but they asked us to think beyond you know whatever is so what about neutron interferometry for these kinds of things? It's I can send you a potential paper you know if people are interested in looking at it it's alternative method and um it has lots of um complementary things to X-rays. So just uh one of like one of the papers I am sure there are other many others so for biological um just just wanted to throw it out there that uh some of the methods have automatic uh you know like the one of the advantages of um uh interferometry is that you're getting uh coherent scatter and it's undiluted with the um long angle uh you know the blurring um uh mechanism for with rally scatter like so basically basically the mechanism is the rally scatter. Uh part of the small angle scatter is the rally scatter. And um so and uh so and the Compton scatter uh is in the another another region of the spectrum. It is important to remove it for that innovation image and we are doing it but it's uh it's more or less not relevant for the small angle scatter. Just just wanted to throw that out.",
