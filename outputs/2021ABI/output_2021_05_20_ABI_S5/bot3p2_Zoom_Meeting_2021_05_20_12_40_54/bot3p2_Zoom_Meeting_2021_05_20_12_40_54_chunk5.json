The fluid or we say the interstitial fluid inside the body will change their flow flow rate or something that we can we can trace. It's difficult to image water directly. So I think this is a good method to look at the water itself directly, not the solutes in the water which is not the case for for water itself.",

Maybe we can consider this as a label free method because typically conventional labeled methods is use chemistry like click method to attach a bulky fluorescence probe onto those nano nano carriers or nano particles.",

So if we add and single atom like deuterium attach a deuterium on the nano carrier or nano particle. Then it's still it's still a original maybe just like original size, maybe a little bit heavier but original size. So still we can consider it a label free technique to to visualize the drug delivery across any vasculature or cell membrane or vasculature walls or in the interstitial even in disease status or tumor. So we can we can image them directly.",

Like and then you could use another experiment where you had these per deuterated polymeric particles where you were trying to use them as you know, to to image them for where they are for treatment of something or maybe had some theranostic value as well, but you could find where the particle was also using a similar method, I guess.",
