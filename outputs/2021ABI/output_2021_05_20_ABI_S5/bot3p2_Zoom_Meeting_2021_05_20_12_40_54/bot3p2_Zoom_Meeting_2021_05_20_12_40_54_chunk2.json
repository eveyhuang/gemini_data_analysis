            "transcript": "the formable modality sensors for biomedical application. So one side is to apply the formable structure of sensors on body for the long term and continuous monitoring. And the other side is to implant the dissolvable sensors inside the body for the transient operation so that the device can safely dissolve inside without the need for the second surgical operation. And my interest with respect to the imaging is on the stretchable photoacoustic imaging where we shine light into the brain and try to capture that infrared light signal through the acoustics signature and to have that long-term monitoring against functional MRI and F needs all these optical method but really apply for the free moving human bodies. And of course, we're also interested in the other wearable stretchable imaging systems. That's me to you all. And next I will pass that on to Mini.",

            "transcript": "Yes, hi. I'm an associate professor at the University of Houston in Physics Department and Biomedical Engineering. Uh my original training is applied optics and optical physics. Uh was developing components in optical fiber gratings and inverse problems. Then from there I moved to biophotonics and imaging during my postdoctoral work. We worked on near infrared optical imaging, some X-ray imaging and in my lab currently we are looking at techniques where we can enhance the contrast in soft tissue at depth without having intrinsic contrast if possible, but we also look at contrast enhanced imaging. Uh some of the work is in looking at maximum information from every detected photon using single photon counting detectors and using it for phase contrast X-ray imaging, understanding how phase variations in X-ray can generate additional contrast without contrast agents and how do you then model this light propagation and and retrieve the information back to get additional information which you can otherwise not get for example in current mammography and other. So one big goal would be label free enhancing contrast early stage detection of cancers. Uh so yes Kevin Kevin just mentioned working with contrast agent. We are also looking at contrast agents for these advanced techniques. Uh while that is not the ultimate goal, we we can learn a lot about heterogeneity like you mentioned earlier, classification, what are the limits we can understand by using contrast agents. So both both are I think needed um to continue. So there is some interest also in multimodality coming back to the near infrared optical imaging uh that I was working in the past. So now there are the field has advanced since I last worked on it and I guess I've learned some more from doing other areas. So there is some interest in coming back to the near infrared optical ultrasound and these multimodality techniques and how can you combine information from these. Uh so those would be some of the future goals. Okay, I guess uh I'll give it next to who's Sapun.",

I've been at UT Austin here for about uh I guess two years and and a little bit for for uh yeah, as an assistant professor in biomedical engineering. And um I work mostly in also chemical imaging like uh like Way and and and also a lot of uh I guess fluorescent and fret based sensors as well as we heard in the last talk. And I'm generally speaking interested in the molecular structure and function of proteins and how they interact with one another both in cells and outside of cells in the context of neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. So we sort of kind of try to design sensors or or experiment where we can kind of probe the coupled interaction between structural changes in molecules and how that affects cellular fate and metabolism. So I guess from there I'll ping pong to Anirudha.",

Uh before this I was at UCLA and uh before that I did my grad school from University of Michigan. Uh I also hold affiliate position at the University of Michigan. Um so my research uh it can broadly be divided into two parts. One is very similar to what Kevin mentioned. So I also work with nanoparticles. Um we develop different types of nanoparticles, polymeric based, metallic, hybrid. Um and then we use it to get different kinds of information from animals or even from inside the cells. Um and with these nanoparticles, we use different kind of optical imaging modalities such as fluorescence, photoacoustics. Um and even basically use it to enhance the scattering from from samples. Uh we use them for diagnostic applications as well as for therapeutic applications. So it would be like nan particles.",

            "transcript": "Thank you. Um yeah, so I am associate professor at LSU. I've been here for like I think this is my seventh year. Um so the yeah, I work on like like uh unfortunately not in a like uh at a much higher resolution like a I mean clinical resolution. So I work on um mammography. So I one of the things that um I'm working on is uh building a face contrast X-ray system for uh you know, finding the microcalcification clusters um quite early even before the tumor is developed. And so um so uh we hope that um the three like I uh have that innovation phase image and the um the uh what's it the the scatter image small angle scatter it's a coherent scatter scattering process. So um so uh so basically uh interferometry and um uh so and then I also work on neutron interferometry. So uh neutrons have a lot better penetration through bone and um so the so or metals, you know, so basically the interfaces are much clearer and it can be also have it can also be operated at very high resolutions. So I have a collaboration with NIST um to work on that. So I'm building a new um MPG like a modulated phase grating system which will hopefully give them the you know, scatter lens from 10 nanometers to like orders of magnitude. So you know, like the uh you know, the correlation lens. So that's hopefully what we can achieve. So one of the ways that maybe I can we can potentially talk about is if the nano like basically small small angle scattering images of the nano nano materials or something something similar. Um and I also have worked on spec, you know, single photon emission tomography. So but that has a tracer as you know radiation radio tracers and um so I don't know if that's so relevant for the label free.",
