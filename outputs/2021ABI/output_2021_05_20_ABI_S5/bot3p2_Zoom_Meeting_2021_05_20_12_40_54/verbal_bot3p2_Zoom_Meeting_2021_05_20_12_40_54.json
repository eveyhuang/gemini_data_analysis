Uh my original training is applied optics and optical physics. Uh was developing components in optical fiber gratings and inverse problems. Then from there I moved to biophotonics and imaging during my postdoctoral work. We worked on near infrared optical imaging, some X-ray imaging and in my lab currently we are looking at techniques where we can enhance the contrast in soft tissue at depth without having intrinsic contrast if possible, but we also look at contrast enhanced imaging. Uh some of the work is in looking at maximum information from every detected photon using single photon counting detectors and using it for phase contrast X-ray imaging, understanding how phase variations in X-ray can generate additional contrast without contrast agents and how do you then model this light propagation and and retrieve the information back to get additional information which you can otherwise not get for example in current mammography and other. So one big goal would be label free enhancing contrast early stage detection of cancers. Uh so yes Kevin Kevin just mentioned working with contrast agent. We are also looking at contrast agents for these advanced techniques. Uh while that is not the ultimate goal, we we can learn a lot about heterogeneity like you mentioned earlier, classification, what are the limits we can understand by using contrast agents. So both both are I think needed um to continue. So there is some interest also in multimodality coming back to the near infrared optical imaging uh that I was working in the past. So now there are the field has advanced since I last worked on it and I guess I've learned some more from doing other areas. So there is some interest in coming back to the near infrared optical ultrasound and these multimodality techniques and how can you combine information from these.

Um so my research uh it can broadly be divided into two parts. One is very similar to what Kevin mentioned. So I also work with nanoparticles. Um we develop different types of nanoparticles, polymeric based, metallic, hybrid. Um and then we use it to get different kinds of information from animals or even from inside the cells. Um and with these nanoparticles, we use different kind of optical imaging modalities such as fluorescence, photoacoustics. Um and even basically use it to enhance the scattering from from samples.

Um so the yeah, I work on like like uh unfortunately not in a like uh at a much higher resolution like a I mean clinical resolution. So I work on um mammography. So I one of the things that um I'm working on is uh building a face contrast X-ray system for uh you know, finding the microcalcification clusters um quite early even before the tumor is developed. And so um so uh we hope that um the three like I uh have that innovation phase image and the um the uh what's it the the scatter image small angle scatter it's a coherent scatter scattering process. So um so uh so basically uh interferometry and um uh so and then I also work on neutron interferometry. So uh neutrons have a lot better penetration through bone and um so the so or metals, you know, so basically the interfaces are much clearer and it can be also have it can also be operated at very high resolutions. So I have a collaboration with NIST um to work on that. So I'm building a new um MPG like a modulated phase grating system which will hopefully give them the you know, scatter lens from 10 nanometers to like orders of magnitude. So you know, like the uh you know, the correlation lens. So that's hopefully what we can achieve. So one of the ways that maybe I can we can potentially talk about is if the nano like basically small small angle scattering images of the nano nano materials or something something similar. Um and I also have worked on spec, you know, single photon emission tomography.

You know like the small angle scatter resides in the first harmonic and the you know the the baseline has the small long angle scatter. So there are lots of methodologies as you know that to remove scatter and we have been very successful with MLM for thicknesses as thick as a breast. Okay so like you can clear a lot of that but mainly it's for the first harmonic like attenuation image it's not the zero harmonic image it's not the small angle with the interferometry the small angle scatter will be in a very different zone. So it will be automatically not having the long angle the the Compton scatter for X-rays you know um or the you know for in for um the in the inelastic scattering for neutrons it won't be interfering with the small angle scatter information if that's what we are looking for. I just throwing it out there that that you know that it's a pretty clean method to get the small angle scatter image and also um if we are I know you you are looking to answer better biological questions but they asked us to think beyond you know whatever is so what about neutron interferometry for these kinds of things? It's I can send you a potential paper you know if people are interested in looking at it it's alternative method and um it has lots of um complementary things to X-rays. So just uh one of like one of the papers I am sure there are other many others so for biological um just just wanted to throw it out there that uh some of the methods have automatic uh you know like the one of the advantages of um uh interferometry is that you're getting uh coherent scatter and it's undiluted with the um long angle uh you know the blurring um uh mechanism for with rally scatter like so basically basically the mechanism is the rally scatter. Uh part of the small angle scatter is the rally scatter. And um so and uh so and the Compton scatter uh is in the another another region of the spectrum. It is important to remove it for that innovation image and we are doing it but it's uh it's more or less not relevant for the small angle scatter. Just just wanted to throw that out. ",
