Do you all have the um slide, which imaging modalities are most compatible for simultaneously data acquisition and integration. Um and then we're going to do introductions, but first we're going to think for a minute. Can orthogonal methods provide both high resolution and deep tissue penetration and are there new combinations of imaging modalities. ",
