But uh I think the key is to have an application where you really need to do both techniques at the same time where you get something out of doing it at the at the same time. For example, pet MRI uh there are not really many applications where you actually need pet MRI. Uh many applications you can do pet and then you do an MRI after that and combining the techniques always is linked to uh or most of the time is linked to a degradation of the performance of the involved techniques. So you really need I mean, I I found it personally to very challenging to find applications. And for example, we submitted a grant uh for uh uh photoacoustic tomography to be integrated into our MRI. already have preliminary data at the time we just couldn't find uh application, killer application. The grant was not funded because they said okay what do you want to do with it? I mean why do you need it? Why can't you do it sequential? So I think that's really important.",

We do need the high resolution. Also we want to have the higher uh sensitivity to detect the nano drugs and especially for the endogenous beta cells like only 2%, less than 2% of the whole uh pancreatic pancreatic tissue. So the problem now is like probably I think the chemist need to like work more on the synthesize and design for the nano particle or whatever probes or tracers, uh you can put together uh and can be detected by by both like MRI and pet. Now, um for example, we're trying to uh label the cells for the MRI and pet. I I work on the pre clinical uh scanner for pet MRI uh for tracing the tracking the cells. We give you an example, we label the cells with iron oxide nano particle, so it can can be detected by MRI. Um, we're trying to uh like also put some radio labeling on the nano particle or just direct label the cells. But it's kind of difficult um because because the pet um uh the the the the I mean the the limitation for the half lifetime also uh for the for the labeling uh because because um I mean that's some problem uh for the chemist. I do think there's applications and I I agree uh um for some comments uh it's it's very expensive if just use it for diagnosis uh in clinic. I mean, um people will just say why why don't you do the sequential scanning? What's the point to do it simultaneously? If you can co co register the images together anyway. Yeah.",

            "transcript": "Thank you so much. So um I think I I was in a optical group yesterday and I was at the microscopic level imaging person and I couldn't find a channel to intervene to discussions here. I we do have the optical people. I think we are talking in the microscopic level and they might have the same problem. So I think we should try to think uh my mentor was always saying how we are going to do this mesoscopic scale to microscopic scale translation. So I think that is that is the even though we are doing MRI, we are far from anything that is come to the neurons and it cellular level. So they are indirect measurements at the end of the day, we will be far from anything that underlying physiology or what is happening in the cellular level. So that is going to be the eventual consequence of using MRI, pet and all those things. Yes, they are powerful, they are clinically useful, but uh we need to try to make the bridge between the very high resolution between the uh microscopic measurements that we do with the MRI. So the way how I do see that for example, try to use the optical imaging that might be so if we are going to think about the multi modality, we should do um small animal models and that we can try to figure out that for example, optical contrast that might generate us different contrast with MRI and and then we can use it to pinpoint the problems that we are looking for. For example, we can do I don't know so the iron they they cause scattering in optical imaging and they use this for example, we can inject those iron into the animal and try to use that iron contrast in the MRI modality and see what it is causing because all entire functional MRI is relying on uh paramagnetic effects of the deoxyhemoglobin which is very strictly iron contrast. So maybe we can amplify the uh signal intensity using this iron of the creative or insanity ideas so",
