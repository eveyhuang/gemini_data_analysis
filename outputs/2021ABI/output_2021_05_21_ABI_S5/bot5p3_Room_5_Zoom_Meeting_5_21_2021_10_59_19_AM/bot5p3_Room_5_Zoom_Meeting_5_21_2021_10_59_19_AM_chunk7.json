You say you brought up limitations, you know, and how do we push, you know, optical imaging more across the different scales, but all of this feeds into a dream. What what what would you want? You know, you have those limitations. Uh, for example, uh, uh, say in the old days we could only image um with say 1 millimeter pixels. But we could dream, we could say, but we really want to image at 0.2 millimeter pixels. And then we go back and we we push um the technology, the detector system or the sources or or the reconstruction or the AI part of the interpretation. So now take those limitations that you have in your mind, but convert them to I wish I had this. And I I think some of because this is a great team here of different modality, different scales and also different use. Some of you are right in the clinical area, other ones are at the bench. Um, and we're we're actually trying to do multi uh fusion of that. Um, so Ellen, where do you see this going? Help us here.",

            "transcript": "Yes, I will give you an example, for example, optical imaging. Raman spectroscopy is quite important for cancer detection during intraoperative scans. It is in place, people are using this Raman spectroscopy to identify the certain mutations during the operation with using the neuro navigators and you can get the same information from the MRI. And for example, you can figure out the Raman spectroscopy signal intensity. So that's all have so when when Ellen highlighted the probes, for example, this can be another probe to do to using the optical information of the tissue during the real time and you can merge it with different types of MRI contrast as as has been highlighted by the Ferdinand and the Lubec and and and that can be merged easily because you do have the all spatial information that comes from the clinical scan during the operation and you do have the optical information and and then you can merge the optical properties with with clinical findings and later on you can merge because it's going to be very well marked with the histopathological information as well. So then you can go back to histology and DNA sequencing and you can have the big data and go to do canonical analysis and find what is interesting.",
