So I'm thinking where in this Candace, do you see um uh your work fitting and where might it be expanded um if you had this capability.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I guess um, I'm not sure about my specific work, but when I think of really big challenges in the field, um, I think of like just huge things, like if we could fix tomorrow we'd change medicine. So, you know, why why is medicine still not personalized? Why do we throw the same hammer at every patient and hope that we'll get something. And then related to that, we do so much imaging, especially in the clinical setting where we do, let's say we do a CT and we're like we're not sure, we better go back and do an MRI, we're not sure, maybe we need an intervention, we need to go back again. And related to that, we have a lot of data in in the clinical case that we throw away. So if we think about complementary imaging, um, you know, if I'm thinking of like huge ideas, what if we had every technique in a single instrument and we sample everything sparsely, so we take, you know, micro scale, nano scale, fluorescence, optical, whatever whatever your favorite technique is in in a modular way and we never needed to throw away data and if the MRI wasn't successful, we also had sparse CT data or we had sparse optical fluorescence data on the cellular level. And I guess it's not particularly, I mean it's related to what I do in in a clinical setting, but I think I think that's what I think of the big problem is we do so much extremely expensive, like prohibitively expensive imaging and we don't even get what we want most of the time and we don't even get cellular or microscopic data on what's actually going on in the diseases. So I I don't have a good application case, but I think if I'm thinking about big problems in the field, that those are the big problems that I see like I I wasn't sure how big we're supposed to be thinking, but if I'm thinking yeah, what do I want to push a button to change today, that would be it.",

And if we could use multimodal approaches to take starting what already works so well in cells and be able to, you know, translate to mice, translate to, you know, maybe even some intermediate mammal before getting to humans. I think that that would be really impactful just from the basic science to get us to really understand molecular processes even in animal models before thinking about the clinic.",

What are the use cases that, you know, let's say you someone said we'll go work on taking the molecular um cellular imaging and move it into mice. What use case pops out? What because sometimes the problem drives the next development. Um, Shiva, do you have a use case or Sampoon, what do you folks think?",

So then like that that is kind of like as if a question for the group that what do you think guys if you wanted to like image a spiking of the neuron in the brain, what imaging modality or what are the combination that could be good.",

I I I've even heard some people trying to do this now at the scale of a monkey. I don't know if somebody here is trying to do that. I don't know if they're going to get their protocol approved.",

And a millimeter is pushing it. Those are the world class research labs that can get to like 1.2 millimeters. But I think it's really hard to get that cellular level resolution at a centimeter deep and you might want to do that. Like when I think I don't know, when Candace was talking, I just had this weird, I don't know, imagination in my head where I'm like somebody on a bed and then they're in a scanner and you've got like 30 probes on them to get every sort of level of imaging that you want and how many of those are really feasible.",

We really do well at working at cover slips and single cells and subcellular things and nano domains like what Anika does and you know, so what I do, but we aren't really good at looking at really big samples. Like I got to be honest. Yeah, and can I add to Sapoon's am I pronounced right? Yeah. Okay. Um, I think I'm I'm really not limited about the resolution because right now there are laminar FMRIs they can go down to the sub millimeter resolution to get the laminar brain activation using seven Tesla scanners and it is getting very common in the occipital cortex using the advanced technology and even if you go to do even higher fields, you can reduce so there's reason uh I framed that mesoscopic to microscopic level so and at this level the functional activation can be detected from human brain is sub millimeter level. So that allows us to map the laminar levels of the brain activation.",
