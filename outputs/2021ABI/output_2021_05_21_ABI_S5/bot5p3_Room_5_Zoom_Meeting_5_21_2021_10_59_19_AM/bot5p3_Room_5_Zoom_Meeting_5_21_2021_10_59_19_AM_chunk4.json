How do we push that technology into tissues to make it, you know, we even starting with tissue slices from from patients from hospitals. Um, and there are a few different considerations, right? You have the scattering and the limitations from optics, you know, how how do we improve adaptive optics and combine that to be able to image with high resolution deeper and deeper into tissues. Um, and then you come to the other aspect of the field of you just, you know, becoming larger and larger when we're typically imaging a single cell, right? Even a single cell is large for us. How do you need higher throughput methods, data, you know, data analysis, online analysis to kind of zoom in on what aspects or what parts of the sample should we kind of zoom in on. Um, do you want to do tiling to really get, you know, all of it or is it enough to have other modalities guide, you know, take a close view at this particular section. So yeah, those are some thoughts, both the scaling up, high throughput, online image analysis, very fast acquisitions and data handling with the adaptive optics and really improving and pushing what can be done when it comes to how how deep, how thick can we image.",

A lot of times we look at multimodality so that we get two different two different types of characteristics say of a patient simultaneously where they're co-registered in time and and space. However, you you noted um tiling or um and we've looked at it even using AI to, you know, you find a suspicious area on at one spatial resolution, say MRI or X-ray or something, and you use AI on that to go down into your scale. So you're using either humans to go find that area or AI, but you're zooming down into the higher spatial resolution. So it's multimodality at two different scales, not simultaneous imaging, but having one guide the other. Uh I think that's that's that's one of the different ways of looking at multimodal. Are you using it simultaneously, you're using it one to get to the other. And I know Ellen has something to say.",

Um, and then maybe if you really need better penetration at a later time point, you know, this would be another place where things like optical and MRI I think would be nice compliments.",

But what if we train our AI models using cellular or microscopic or nanoscale data to predict what we see with MR or microscopic images. So what if we actually train the models between modalities and I think that's a really broad thing. Actually that was something I would love to work on is for example, I get I I take an MRI image of a patient, then we do a biopsy. I take the sample, I send it to you, you train your image and can you predict my MR image? I think that would be a great use case. I would love to work on something like that. And I think that's really broadly impactful, right? Could we predict from what we see in the cell, which we do anyways, we do pathology on all of our patients, you know, especially if there's a tumor, what if we took that and then could predict and I don't even have to do a $2,000 MRI scan. Um, I don't know, this is one idea. I I would be interested in working on something like that. I'm not sure if we're supposed to be talking about really concrete proposal ideas, but",
