So um I think I I was in a optical group yesterday and I was at the microscopic level imaging person and I couldn't find a channel to intervene to discussions here. I we do have the optical people. I think we are talking in the microscopic level and they might have the same problem. So I think we should try to think uh my mentor was always saying how we are going to do this mesoscopic scale to microscopic scale translation. So I think that is that is the even though we are doing MRI, we are far from anything that is come to the neurons and it cellular level. So they are indirect measurements at the end of the day, we will be far from anything that underlying physiology or what is happening in the cellular level. So that is going to be the eventual consequence of using MRI, pet and all those things. Yes, they are powerful, they are clinically useful, but uh we need to try to make the bridge between the very high resolution between the uh microscopic measurements that we do with the MRI. So the way how I do see that for example, try to use the optical imaging that might be so if we are going to think about the multi modality, we should do um small animal models and that we can try to figure out that for example, optical contrast that might generate us different contrast with MRI and and then we can use it to pinpoint the problems that we are looking for. For example, we can do I don't know so the iron they they cause scattering in optical imaging and they use this for example, we can inject those iron into the animal and try to use that iron contrast in the MRI modality and see what it is causing because all entire functional MRI is relying on uh paramagnetic effects of the deoxyhemoglobin which is very strictly iron contrast. So maybe we can amplify the uh signal intensity using this iron of the creative or insanity ideas so ",

So, you know, why why is medicine still not personalized? Why do we throw the same hammer at every patient and hope that we'll get something. And then related to that, we do so much imaging, especially in the clinical setting where we do, let's say we do a CT and we're like we're not sure, we better go back and do an MRI, we're not sure, maybe we need an intervention, we need to go back again. And related to that, we have a lot of data in in the clinical case that we throw away. So if we think about complementary imaging, um, you know, if I'm thinking of like huge ideas, what if we had every technique in a single instrument and we sample everything sparsely, so we take, you know, micro scale, nano scale, fluorescence, optical, whatever whatever your favorite technique is in in a modular way and we never needed to throw away data and if the MRI wasn't successful, we also had sparse CT data or we had sparse optical fluorescence data on the cellular level. And I guess it's not particularly, I mean it's related to what I do in in a clinical setting, but I think I think that's what I think of the big problem is we do so much extremely expensive, like prohibitively expensive imaging and we don't even get what we want most of the time and we don't even get cellular or microscopic data on what's actually going on in the diseases. So I I don't have a good application case, but I think if I'm thinking about big problems in the field, that those are the big problems that I see like I I wasn't sure how big we're supposed to be thinking, but if I'm thinking yeah, what do I want to push a button to change today, that would be it.

So you're using either humans to go find that area or AI, but you're zooming down into the higher spatial resolution. So it's multimodality at two different scales, not simultaneous imaging, but having one guide the other. Uh I think that's that's that's one of the different ways of looking at multimodal.
