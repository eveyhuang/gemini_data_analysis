But uh I think the key is to have an application where you really need to do both techniques at the same time where you get something out of doing it at the at the same time. For example, pet MRI uh there are not really many applications where you actually need pet MRI. Uh many applications you can do pet and then you do an MRI after that and combining the techniques always is linked to uh or most of the time is linked to a degradation of the performance of the involved techniques. So you really need I mean, I I found it personally to very challenging to find applications. And for example, we submitted a grant uh for uh uh photoacoustic tomography to be integrated into our MRI. already have preliminary data at the time we just couldn't find uh application, killer application. The grant was not funded because they said okay what do you want to do with it? I mean why do you need it? Why can't you do it sequential? So I think that's really important.",

So um I think I I was in a optical group yesterday and I was at the microscopic level imaging person and I couldn't find a channel to intervene to discussions here. I we do have the optical people. I think we are talking in the microscopic level and they might have the same problem. So I think we should try to think uh my mentor was always saying how we are going to do this mesoscopic scale to microscopic scale translation. So I think that is that is the even though we are doing MRI, we are far from anything that is come to the neurons and it cellular level. So they are indirect measurements at the end of the day, we will be far from anything that underlying physiology or what is happening in the cellular level. So that is going to be the eventual consequence of using MRI, pet and all those things. Yes, they are powerful, they are clinically useful, but uh we need to try to make the bridge between the very high resolution between the uh microscopic measurements that we do with the MRI. So the way how I do see that for example, try to use the optical imaging that might be so if we are going to think about the multi modality, we should do um small animal models and that we can try to figure out that for example, optical contrast that might generate us different contrast with MRI and and then we can use it to pinpoint the problems that we are looking for. For example, we can do I don't know so the iron they they cause scattering in optical imaging and they use this for example, we can inject those iron into the animal and try to use that iron contrast in the MRI modality and see what it is causing because all entire functional MRI is relying on uh paramagnetic effects of the deoxyhemoglobin which is very strictly iron contrast. So maybe we can amplify the uh signal intensity using this iron of the creative or insanity ideas so",

So, you know, why why is medicine still not personalized? Why do we throw the same hammer at every patient and hope that we'll get something. And then related to that, we do so much imaging, especially in the clinical setting where we do, let's say we do a CT and we're like we're not sure, we better go back and do an MRI, we're not sure, maybe we need an intervention, we need to go back again. And related to that, we have a lot of data in in the clinical case that we throw away. So if we think about complementary imaging, um, you know, if I'm thinking of like huge ideas, what if we had every technique in a single instrument and we sample everything sparsely, so we take, you know, micro scale, nano scale, fluorescence, optical, whatever whatever your favorite technique is in in a modular way and we never needed to throw away data and if the MRI wasn't successful, we also had sparse CT data or we had sparse optical fluorescence data on the cellular level. And I guess it's not particularly, I mean it's related to what I do in in a clinical setting, but I think I think that's what I think of the big problem is we do so much extremely expensive, like prohibitively expensive imaging and we don't even get what we want most of the time and we don't even get cellular or microscopic data on what's actually going on in the diseases. So I I don't have a good application case, but I think if I'm thinking about big problems in the field, that those are the big problems that I see like I I wasn't sure how big we're supposed to be thinking, but if I'm thinking yeah, what do I want to push a button to change today, that would be it.",

How do we push that technology into tissues to make it, you know, we even starting with tissue slices from from patients from hospitals. Um, and there are a few different considerations, right? You have the scattering and the limitations from optics, you know, how how do we improve adaptive optics and combine that to be able to image with high resolution deeper and deeper into tissues. Um, and then you come to the other aspect of the field of you just, you know, becoming larger and larger when we're typically imaging a single cell, right? Even a single cell is large for us. How do you need higher throughput methods, data, you know, data analysis, online analysis to kind of zoom in on what aspects or what parts of the sample should we kind of zoom in on. Um, do you want to do tiling to really get, you know, all of it or is it enough to have other modalities guide, you know, take a close view at this particular section. So yeah, those are some thoughts, both the scaling up, high throughput, online image analysis, very fast acquisitions and data handling with the adaptive optics and really improving and pushing what can be done when it comes to how how deep, how thick can we image.",

So you're using either humans to go find that area or AI, but you're zooming down into the higher spatial resolution. So it's multimodality at two different scales, not simultaneous imaging, but having one guide the other. Uh I think that's that's that's one of the different ways of looking at multimodal.

So what if we actually train the models between modalities and I think that's a really broad thing. Actually that was something I would love to work on is for example, I get I I take an MRI image of a patient, then we do a biopsy. I take the sample, I send it to you, you train your image and can you predict my MR image? I think that would be a great use case. I would love to work on something like that. And I think that's really broadly impactful, right? Could we predict from what we see in the cell, which we do anyways, we do pathology on all of our patients, you know, especially if there's a tumor, what if we took that and then could predict and I don't even have to do a $2,000 MRI scan.

It is in place, people are using this Raman spectroscopy to identify the certain mutations during the operation with using the neuro navigators and you can get the same information from the MRI. And for example, you can figure out the Raman spectroscopy signal intensity. So that's all have so when when Ellen highlighted the probes, for example, this can be another probe to do to using the optical information of the tissue during the real time and you can merge it with different types of MRI contrast as as has been highlighted by the Ferdinand and the Lubec and and and that can be merged easily because you do have the all spatial information that comes from the clinical scan during the operation and you do have the optical information and and then you can merge the optical properties with with clinical findings and later on you can merge because it's going to be very well marked with the histopathological information as well. So then you can go back to histology and DNA sequencing and you can have the big data and go to do canonical analysis and find what is interesting.",
