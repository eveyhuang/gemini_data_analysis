Um and pH dynamics are important for things like cell migration, uh cell division, metabolic reprogramming and disregulated pH dynamics are are linked to cancer. And so we've developed a couple of new optogenetic tools that allow us to specifically manipulate pH inside cells. And we're kind of struggling right now with with how when we do that manipulation, how do we understand the biology that we're seeing as we look at protein dynamics in real time and how do we kind of look at these heterogeneous responses.

And I'm in the biology department there and my my major research focus is on the cell biology of cilia and how they signal and how they move. So cilia are these whip-like structures that either serve as antenna or they serve as generators of hydrodynamic force to move fluid. And some cilia do both. So some cilia are sensing while they're actually beating through the aqueous environment. And so what I'm interested in understanding is how do these things get built and once they're built, how do they actually transduce signals? Um they they've got some some quirks to them that are not intuitive uh such as that the entire Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway in mammals operates through cilia by recruiting transcription factors to the tip of cilia and that's required and and for reasons that we don't quite know. So it's really important though to understand how things move within these structures and it's tough because they're 200 nanometers in diameter and about five microns long. So they're they're challenging to image and they're also dynamic. So they can be moving it up to 20 hertz. So they're they're very challenging structure to image. Um and I I'm excited to be here because I feel like, you know, approaching it with my bread and butter fluorescence microscopy, um which is now turning into a little bit of also flint microscopy, it's going to require something more than that. So I'm excited to see if if somebody has any ideas. And the next person that I see is Meleka.",

What we do in the lab is really at the intersection of instrument development, computational tool development, and the application of these for biological samples. Obviously, we do a lot of work collaboratively. So the instrument development right now, we jointly work with a couple of labs, one of them being Eric Betzig, who developed the lattice light sheet and also won the Nobel Prize for this new molecular localization microscopy. On the computational side of things, we are developing terabyte to petabyte scale scalable tools that can basically handle these scale of data sets that are generated typically from these large whether it's dynamic imaging 4D in the context of 3D plus chemistry plus time or scalable tissue super resolution, which is like combining expansion microscopy to bypass like the laws of physics with the type of light sheet imaging that we do. But the main interest of the lab is really to be able to record the dynamics in the scale of milliseconds and and kind of track them over nanometers to understand what kind of consequences these things have at the scale of microns, but in the time scale of minutes and then really understand like the biological impact up to the scale of millimeters over hours or days.

I'm relatively new associate professor, and I just got tenure a little bit ago. We are very interested in light sheet imaging, and I'll admit, honestly, I've never really tracked any particle within cell. But the kind of imaging that we develop, which isn't super high resolution, but is kind of intermediate resolution and trying to capture larger scale phenomena with using only a single objective that's compatible with a lot of different sample types for which orthogonally positioned kind of classical light sheet objectives are limiting. And so I would love to be able to track movement of, for example, cell types across time. So we're coming up against being able to generate the type of data I cannot manage very effectively at all. So I hope to meet here some people that are much more familiar with these large-scale data set processing, storage, management, and effective analytics. I'm also really interested on the neuroscience side of things in neuronal plasticity and in particular the production of new synapses, which for many neuronal types become compartmentalized into little structures, membranous protrusions that have a little bit of connection to cilia in the sense that they're also mobile. They can be formed very quickly. We can induce their formation with multiphoton photolysis in particular ways with genetic targeting in brain sections from acutely prepared from the mouse brain. And so we're kind of in that single photon, multiphoton, intermediate resolution scale applications, and I hope to make a lot of connections here with all of you. And I think for genetically encoded probes, a big question for me continues to be, how do we track movements of increasingly kind of more refined organelles or particles or labeled receptors in a way that doesn't rely on massive overexpression and makes the best use of hardware developments and software developments that are coming online now.

There's some burning things you want to discuss a little bit more. I think overall our session is currently focusing on the the particles within cells, right? So could be any of the particles, cilia, protein subdomain, synapse, and or nanoparticles, any of the particles. So some of the questions, you know, label-free or if we label them, how do we minimally perturb? Can we do it at the endogenous level or the probes good enough to to capture that? If we try to CRISPR in and do it at the endogenous level, their dynamics and they may exchange many of the components, and then they're very heterogeneous. So how do we deal all of that?

We're also using uh and developing far red shifted ones for us to potentially do this in a more easily through our spheroid models and more easily and potentially tissue or whole zebrafish um models for long-term imaging. And so the the question that we have is that when we sample for example pH heterogeneity which we're we're interested in because we find that normal epithelial cells have reduced intracellular pH heterogeneity compared to cancer cells. That might be reflective of altered phenotype, altered signaling. And so when we do these pH maps in two dimensions and in three dimensions, we can detect this heterogeneity. We can detect this these populations of of disregulated cancer cells that are far outside of the norm of whatever we see in normal cellular conditions. And now we have tools that allow us to raise pH specifically in normal cells to try and ask some of these questions, but we're still left with this at these extremes of population, are those meaningful? We can see phenotypes where the highest pH have a certain phenotype and the lowest pH have a certain phenotype. But then when we go to try and quantify that, it takes a ton of time to sample enough to find those populations. And then you know, identifying them and then quantifying them, you're left with super small ends on each end that are difficult compared to compare to an entire population. And so that's what we're struggling with at the at the cellular scale. And then you can imagine the same kind of thing happening when you scale down to them to the molecular scale, right? Um and so we have this tool that allows us to raise pH in a single cell. We look at protein dynamics. Again, we get a population of responses and a population of behaviors. And we don't know whether these rare events are biologically meaningful. They are certainly increased in disregulated cells compared to normal cells. So that suggests that there might be something important there. But how do you even do the statistics? How do you even like compare like hundreds of data points versus 20 to 30 to 40 that might be biologically meaningful at all scales.",

And so as we move to more patient relevant samples that are more heterogeneous, that are more precious, that are lower numbers, like how do we it's easy to collect, you know, thousands of cells and thousands of data points on these clonal cell line populations. But then if we want to extend this and show more cancer relevance, you're always going to have contracting n through through that kind of translational step word. And so, yeah, and and so I think you're getting it exactly the right thing in terms of sampling. How do you sample to collect these rare populations? And then if you can sample indefinitely, then yes, you'll collect them and you'll get enough end to be able to do that comparison. But you're always limited in terms of of your sampling. So then the question is, how do you stratify your data or our question is, how do you stratify your data to to get potentially biologically meaningful results on that you could then follow up on mechanistically. Um yeah, so that's that's something that that potentially going to get better. Potentially there are already tools out there that we can't that we don't know about or that we haven't yet been um applying to our pipeline, but it's something that that weighs on me in terms of moving some of these projects forward following up on what I think are really interesting results.

I'm not sure if that's coming from my microphone or Okay. Um yeah, so basically there's two steps to this, right? Um one is the object identification that we're interested in tracking and the other is basically tracking that particular object, right? So the tracking aspect of it, um again, linear assignment problems and all of those things, you know, take care of that along with like the motion modeling. So that I don't think is too much of uh I mean, unless people want to discuss that. I don't think there's much um to to improve upon there except for like maybe now the advent of um of AI to be able to to take of",
