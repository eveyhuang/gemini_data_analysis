            "transcript": "Yeah, so we we do we use a pH fluorescent protein based pH biosensors. um the most commonly used of of which in the literature is one that we use frequently which is called fluorine. We're also using uh and developing far red shifted ones for us to potentially do this in a more easily through our spheroid models and more easily and potentially tissue or whole zebrafish um models for long-term imaging. And so the the question that we have is that when we sample for example pH heterogeneity which we're we're interested in because we find that normal epithelial cells have reduced intracellular pH heterogeneity compared to cancer cells. That might be reflective of altered phenotype, altered signaling. And so when we do these pH maps in two dimensions and in three dimensions, we can detect this heterogeneity. We can detect this these populations of of disregulated cancer cells that are far outside of the norm of whatever we see in normal cellular conditions. And now we have tools that allow us to raise pH specifically in normal cells to try and ask some of these questions, but we're still left with this at these extremes of population, are those meaningful? We can see phenotypes where the highest pH have a certain phenotype and the lowest pH have a certain phenotype. But then when we go to try and quantify that, it takes a ton of time to sample enough to find those populations. And then you know, identifying them and then quantifying them, you're left with super small ends on each end that are difficult compared to compare to an entire population. And so that's what we're struggling with at the at the cellular scale. And then you can imagine the same kind of thing happening when you scale down to them to the molecular scale, right? Um and so we have this tool that allows us to raise pH in a single cell. We look at protein dynamics. Again, we get a population of responses and a population of behaviors. And we don't know whether these rare events are biologically meaningful. They are certainly increased in disregulated cells compared to normal cells. So that suggests that there might be something important there. But how do you even do the statistics? How do you even like compare like hundreds of data points versus 20 to 30 to 40 that might be biologically meaningful at all scales.",

And so as we move to more patient relevant samples that are more heterogeneous, that are more precious, that are lower numbers, like how do we it's easy to collect, you know, thousands of cells and thousands of data points on these clonal cell line populations. But then if we want to extend this and show more cancer relevance, you're always going to have contracting n through through that kind of translational step word. And so, yeah, and and so I think you're getting it exactly the right thing in terms of sampling. How do you sample to collect these rare populations? And then if you can sample indefinitely, then yes, you'll collect them and you'll get enough end to be able to do that comparison. But you're always limited in terms of of your sampling. So then the question is, how do you stratify your data or our question is, how do you stratify your data to to get potentially biologically meaningful results on that you could then follow up on mechanistically. Um yeah, so that's that's something that that potentially going to get better. Potentially there are already tools out there that we can't that we don't know about or that we haven't yet been um applying to our pipeline, but it's something that that weighs on me in terms of moving some of these projects forward following up on what I think are really interesting results.

But now as we are advancing our methods, I think that this question will come up more and more and like what what is actually, you know, the most important science to follow and every field has has this challenge and um but maybe thinking about what is the most important aspect of probes for looking at intracellular events right now, like do we really want to be pushing this sensitivity or is it more important for us to, you know, really focus on these first questions about label free and really non-perturbing such that none of these small populations that we're seeing are really coming from our probes and artifacts that we're introducing.",

The tracking I think is a is a from an algorithmic perspective is a soft problem, right? in the context of, you know, we can as long as we're able to take actually, um I think there's some echo gen. I'm not sure if that's coming from my microphone or Okay. Um yeah, so basically there's two steps to this, right? Um one is the object identification that we're interested in tracking and the other is basically tracking that particular object, right? So the tracking aspect of it, um again, linear assignment problems and all of those things, you know, take care of that along with like the motion modeling. So that I don't think is too much of uh I mean, unless people want to discuss that. I don't think there's much um to to improve upon there except for like maybe now the advent of um of AI to be able to to take of",
