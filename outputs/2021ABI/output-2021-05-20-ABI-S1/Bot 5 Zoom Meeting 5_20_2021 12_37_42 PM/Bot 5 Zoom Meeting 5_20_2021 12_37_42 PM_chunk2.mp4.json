What we do in the lab is really at the intersection of instrument development, computational tool development, and the application of these for biological samples. Obviously, we do a lot of work collaboratively. So the instrument development right now, we jointly work with a couple of labs, one of them being Eric Betzig, who developed the lattice light sheet and also won the Nobel Prize for this new molecular localization microscopy. On the computational side of things, we are developing terabyte to petabyte scale scalable tools that can basically handle these scale of data sets that are generated typically from these large whether it's dynamic imaging 4D in the context of 3D plus chemistry plus time or scalable tissue super resolution, which is like combining expansion microscopy to bypass like the laws of physics with the type of light sheet imaging that we do. But the main interest of the lab is really to be able to record the dynamics in the scale of milliseconds and and kind of track them over nanometers to understand what kind of consequences these things have at the scale of microns, but in the time scale of minutes and then really understand like the biological impact up to the scale of millimeters over hours or days. Yeah. Thank you.",

So I'm interested in making polymer materials with bacterial cells and communities. So my big question is how we study these three-dimensionally organized bacterial communities, and I'm particularly interested in how they communicate, how they move, how they divide. And also, when you think about something that's immobilized, like small cells, like bacteria, then you can imagine microscopy can be probably the only tool to really deduce out important biological information. So in that, I want to learn a lot of new techniques and hope to form meaningful collaborations in this meeting. And here I see if Kenya on my screen.",

            "transcript": "Thank you. With the kind of name such as mine, I get picked last for any sports team. So I am Yevgenia or Jenya Kozorovitsky, and I'm at Northwestern University. I'm relatively new associate professor, and I just got tenure a little bit ago. We are very interested in light sheet imaging, and I'll admit, honestly, I've never really tracked any particle within cell. But the kind of imaging that we develop, which isn't super high resolution, but is kind of intermediate resolution and trying to capture larger scale phenomena with using only a single objective that's compatible with a lot of different sample types for which orthogonally positioned kind of classical light sheet objectives are limiting. And so I would love to be able to track movement of, for example, cell types across time. So we're coming up against being able to generate the type of data I cannot manage very effectively at all. So I hope to meet here some people that are much more familiar with these large-scale data set processing, storage, management, and effective analytics. I'm also really interested on the neuroscience side of things in neuronal plasticity and in particular the production of new synapses, which for many neuronal types become compartmentalized into little structures, membranous protrusions that have a little bit of connection to cilia in the sense that they're also mobile. They can be formed very quickly. We can induce their formation with multiphoton photolysis in particular ways with genetic targeting in brain sections from acutely prepared from the mouse brain. And so we're kind of in that single photon, multiphoton, intermediate resolution scale applications, and I hope to make a lot of connections here with all of you. And I think for genetically encoded probes, a big question for me continues to be, how do we track movements of increasingly kind of more refined organelles or particles or labeled receptors in a way that doesn't rely on massive overexpression and makes the best use of hardware developments and software developments that are coming online now. Thanks. And I guess, Jin, Sam, should I call on one of you?",

Let's get started on the on the discussion. I think maybe just fire it away. We'll follow up on some of the points that that were mentioned by by people. There's some burning things you want to discuss a little bit more. I think overall our session is currently focusing on the the particles within cells, right? So could be any of the particles, cilia, protein subdomain, synapse, and or nanoparticles, any of the particles. So some of the questions, you know, label-free or if we label them, how do we minimally perturb? Can we do it at the endogenous level or the probes good enough to to capture that? If we try to CRISPR in and do it at the endogenous level, their dynamics and they may exchange many of the components, and then they're very heterogeneous. So how do we deal all of that? And also large data set that was already mentioned by a couple people. So any of these topics fire it away.",

And some of the questions you posed today are very relevant to what we do all the time. Where do these particles go and how do we track them? So I look forward to the ideas today.",
