So if we go into if we the the conversation just flows and we will just uh share our thoughts. Um if we you know, have a pause, then maybe I'll ask someone to share, you know, what you have written down at the beginning of the session. So that's the tip we got. Um okay, that's the purpose of you know, writing down some thoughts at the beginning. Okay, now uh brief intro. Shall we um go? Let's do it this way. Uh maybe I'll uh go with uh Catherine and Catherine will call the next person who's going to do the self intro. How about that?",

            "transcript": "Great, sounds good. Um I'm Katherine White. I'm a faculty at the University of Notre Dame. My lab studies how cellular pH dynamics, intracellular pH dynamics affect protein structure function. And we have projects that go from the molecular scale, so trying to understand these structural protein changes as well as to the cellular and tissue scale. Um and pH dynamics are important for things like cell migration, uh cell division, metabolic reprogramming and disregulated pH dynamics are are linked to cancer. And so we've developed a couple of new optogenetic tools that allow us to specifically manipulate pH inside cells. And we're kind of struggling right now with with how when we do that manipulation, how do we understand the biology that we're seeing as we look at protein dynamics in real time and how do we kind of look at these heterogeneous responses. Um and so that's that's why I'm interested in in this kind of uh project. So happy to talk more later, but I'll uh pass it off to the next person on my screen which is Ellen.",

And our lab makes fluorophores for the short wave infrared and near infrared two region. and we use these for non-invasive whole animal imaging. Um and really now we have a suite of probes and have showcased that we can do real-time excitation based multiplex imaging and we're you know, ready to to dive into some important questions. So I feel like this meeting is a really good time to figure out what directions we really want to go in now. And I will pass to Nick.",

            "transcript": "My name is Nick Delati. I'm an assistant professor at Western Washington University. And I'm in the biology department there and my my major research focus is on the cell biology of cilia and how they signal and how they move. So cilia are these whip-like structures that either serve as antenna or they serve as generators of hydrodynamic force to move fluid. And some cilia do both. So some cilia are sensing while they're actually beating through the aqueous environment. And so what I'm interested in understanding is how do these things get built and once they're built, how do they actually transduce signals? Um they they've got some some quirks to them that are not intuitive uh such as that the entire Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway in mammals operates through cilia by recruiting transcription factors to the tip of cilia and that's required and and for reasons that we don't quite know. So it's really important though to understand how things move within these structures and it's tough because they're 200 nanometers in diameter and about five microns long. So they're they're challenging to image and they're also dynamic. So they can be moving it up to 20 hertz. So they're they're very challenging structure to image. Um and I I'm excited to be here because I feel like, you know, approaching it with my bread and butter fluorescence microscopy, um which is now turning into a little bit of also flint microscopy, it's going to require something more than that. So I'm excited to see if if somebody has any ideas. And the next person that I see is Meleka.",

My lab is uh interested in using and further developing um single molecule based um uh super resolution approaches to understand how uh spatial temporal organization of proteins within the cell impact protein uh impact cell function. And particularly related to this topic, uh we've been interested in um genome folding, uh nuclear organization, in particular the interaction of uh transcription factors um with uh DNA with the genome and how the underlying folding of the DNA impacts those interactions and how the interactions themselves can change the underlying folding of the DNA. So we do a lot of single molecule tracking um of um transcription factors to try to understand how they interact with the underlying um uh uh chromatin and and and and genome. And we often make inferences from, you know, very short trajectories. These are very short-lived um trajectories because they're limited by the um photo bleaching of the fluorophores. Um and so I'm interested in, you know, um brainstorming about ideas um about how uh to make those inferences more direct, um you know, uh whether something is really binding to DNA or not binding to DNA is I think a measurement that we make that is kind of indirect. Um and so I'm interested in understanding how we can extend the trajectories, make them longer live and and make more direct measurements about, you know, longer events rather than these very short events.",
