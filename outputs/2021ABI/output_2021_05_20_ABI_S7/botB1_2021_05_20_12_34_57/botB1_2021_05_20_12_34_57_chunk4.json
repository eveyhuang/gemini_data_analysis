In confocal, you're using a pin hole to collect that um the light the ballistic photons that you are interested in and you're using that pin hole to block all those other scattered lights um where it's coming from. And so if you collect with a camera and you focus if you collect the light from where your pin hole would be, that would be your, you know, from your central focal area, but you could collect the scattered um multi photon light so that you can then collect more of that signal.",
