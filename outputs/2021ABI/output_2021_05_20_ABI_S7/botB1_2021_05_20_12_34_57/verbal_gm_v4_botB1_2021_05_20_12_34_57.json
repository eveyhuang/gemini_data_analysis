Like at what level does that get so complicated and so expensive that it's not really it's not really useful. And so I I would really like to I think my background is is in more of the second thinking more about the second part of this question, but I think what intrigues me about this room is thinking about the two of these together, especially because super resolution microscopy I think is often speaking as somebody who's not well trained in that area, but seems to me to be very photon start in general, like you need a lot of light. Um and so if you're saying, okay, well I'm going to throw out all the scattered photons, you're walking a you know, that line is going to get hard to walk pretty quickly. So I I think that I really like the thinking about how how can we maybe take these two together and I'm not I haven't seen too much looking at super resolution combined with thinking deeper in tissue and how to think about scattering. And the last thing I'll say just to uh is I also wonder what the room is for conversations in between let's say minimally invasive types of technology as a stepping stone to getting to the ultimate goal where we just shine some light outside the body and then capture everything outside the body non invasively, but maybe minimally invasive with um, you know, fibers, fiber bundles, uh these kind of things can be a a nice stepping stone to push things into the into practice because I think with biomedical imaging outside of the like really big success of OCT, there is not so many optical like biomedical optical techniques that have really made a significant um, you know, push into the clinic.

So there is something um I was thinking about. Uh, I was doing uh uh super resolution when I was doing super resolution microscope, I always wanted to stabilize the sample so that with a with a long uh long-term imaging, for example, like 30 minutes, I don't get a great uh sample drift. So one way I was thinking while I was a post talk is to use the scattering light from the cell. So we take uh we take the scattering light uh the image using scattering light of the cell at at the beginning of the imaging and after a few minutes, we take another one. So by the end, like by the end of the imaging, we could use those image to align um kind of put to the kind of uh correct the drift. So that's one thing I was thinking about. Uh, but I haven't tested and I'm not sure how precise we can do as my uh uh I claim it 10 nanometer uh uh uh precision. So I'm trying to make sure how I can how precisely I can do that. And uh some thoughts for the first uh question like how can super resolution uh methods can be translated to uh uh organismal applications. Um, I have been thinking about that for the past few years. Um, one thing I found uh uh that could be helpful is maybe uh stabilizing the floor for chemistry because right now uh I put a lot of time on doing uh imaging analysis uh like look at all the localizations and how to cluster them, how to figure out the organization of the proteins. But at the end of the day, I thought if we could use different floor force to map these what I mean is if I put it in a example, see if we have a DNA molecule, they can uh kind of fold into different structure. Like if we wanted to figure out the structure, let's see uh we can use uh maybe the barcoding system, like we can since we know the sequence, we probably can uh use the barcoding to map the entire sequence, then then we label that molecule uh on cells, then we can image that. Maybe we know, we would figure out like uh how they position the spatial. So that's So I think um maybe uh aside from the imaging processing just using AI or deep learning to look at the clusters or organizations, maybe uh uh floor for might be helpful on that.

And that's the that I think is the kernel of the revolutionary idea here is like let's remove that constraint and go back to the drawing board and think differently. And so that I think that that's one thing. The other thing I was thinking about related to this conversation of so much data and resolution is you need the resolution but not everywhere. And maybe we don't need the super resolution at all points. So you can think at a native structure like I want to try to have, you know, again as optical designers, conventionally, we think about isotropic resolution everywhere. But in a more if we remove that constraint and think about, well maybe I just care about super resolution here and here and here and here in these specific parts of the cell and everywhere else, I don't care. It's fine if I have millimeter resolution maybe. I just want to be able to zoom into these certain areas. And so maybe there's I think if we think about more interesting ways to we have a limited number of pixels or voxels or bits or however you want to whatever fundamental quanta of information you want to think about that we can distribute along our in our sample. And so can we think about innovative ways to redistribute that in a in a way that's efficient but maybe isn't, you know, interpretable without a algorithm to understand or reconstruct or give us some meaningful information about what's going on.
