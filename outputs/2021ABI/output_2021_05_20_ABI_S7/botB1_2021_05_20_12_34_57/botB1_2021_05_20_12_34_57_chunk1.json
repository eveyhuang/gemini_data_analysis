I think there are two ways to think about it. So if we are talking about like traditional super resolution techniques like optics, uh multiple scattering is the enemy because they scramble your light. So the first way to think about it is how can we gate these multiple scattering? How can we reject them so that we can only get ballistic photons that carry the truly valuable information. And then a second direction, a second perspective on this is how do we use multiple scattering to get more information? Because these ballistic photons decay exponentially as you go deeper into the tissue.",
