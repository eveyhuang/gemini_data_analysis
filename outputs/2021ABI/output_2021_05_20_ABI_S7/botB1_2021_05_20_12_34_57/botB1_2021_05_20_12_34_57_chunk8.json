Welcome everyone to the Research Corporation for Science Advancement Scialog on Chemical Machinery of the Cell. I'm Kristen Maitland, I'm at Texas A&M University, and I'm one of your facilitators for this Scialog. And I'm really excited to be here with you all today. I think we have a really exciting program planned. And I'm really looking forward to the next few days of discussion and collaboration. So with that, I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to Andrew Feig, who's going to give you a little bit of background on RCSA.",
