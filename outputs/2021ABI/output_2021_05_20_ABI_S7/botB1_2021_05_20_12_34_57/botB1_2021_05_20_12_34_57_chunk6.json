So we don't do it in that sense, but maybe Oze, maybe you've already discussed like compressed sensing. I'm not sure if we've gotten that far, but in MR, we do kind of have ways that we refer to as super resolution, but um certainly not in the same way. I came I heard multiplexing.

And so I do think I'm really glad that there are two of you that are in MR in this room because I feel like as you discuss with each other in the next couple days, um if you can talk about um how you approach you know, resolution and improving resolution and something like compressed sensing, you know, which is applied to both fields, but the different approaches, I think sometimes it's hard for them to bridge over those those gaps between fields. And so the more you can talk together about, well how do you do this or why do you do that or um there's a real opportunity there I think in terms of working together across fields. Um, so I'll just point that out. Um, we have about um 15 minutes left, I believe. Um, yeah, and so uh we'll maybe just talk for another five minutes and then I think we should revisit kind of our key points and and try to narrow those down so that when Josh reports out, we have a a more focused report out.",

Um, I don't know, let's say entangled photons for instance, example, right? Uh, are there cute little tricks that we could do to uh make them more robust to what classical detection would fail at. Uh, you know, maybe it requires us to to go about that way. Just just a thought.",

Uh, so that's one way and I feel like uh the notion you mentioned entangled photons could be very interesting because people are already doing that for telescope and as we know, we are the retarded grandkids for from the astronomist as micro physicist. So maybe maybe that's the I I feel like that could be a very high risk, high reward uh uh notion to do. Uh, I also want to bring back to Vivian's comments in the beginning uh about fluorophores and I think um I forgot the other uh the other comment about but I think there uh are some ways to move this forward with innovations in fluorophore. I'm not the expert in it, but um I was seeing this like um they called it sparse imaging, sparse labeling. So what they do is that instead of just labeling like everywhere, they have this very strong, distinct and punctuate spots in the cells. So, um, I feel like that's that's uh something we could take advantage of either in compressed sensing or guide star imaging. Um, and we can even just to think about what imaging needs and then collaborate with chemists to design the fluorophores we want, what shape they want to be, what color etc, etc.",

So maybe it's it's not just the spectral properties but also um like the luminescence lifetime of those materials that that can then be used as as labels um for certain features um of of interest, right? And one example um uh material is called up conversion nanoparticles that have anti anti stokes emission. Um they um typically have luminescence lifetimes in like the millisecond or microsecond range. So that's um orders of magnitude difference to to what you would have with the commercial floor so this may also be uh helpful in the end.",

So this definitely something that that we could could work on. And then the other thing um engineering the the luminescence lifetime and this can happen through multiple means. Um material engineering is probably the the easiest step to do just playing around with the element compositions that you uh put in into those nano materials gives you already uh different lifetimes.
