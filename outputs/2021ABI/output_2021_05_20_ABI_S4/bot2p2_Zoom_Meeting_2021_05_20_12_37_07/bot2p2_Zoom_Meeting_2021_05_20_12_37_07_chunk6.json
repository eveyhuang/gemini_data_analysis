You have access I would assume to biologist much easier than they have access to medical imaging people. Alex, do you have access to who you need to talk to? And then also Girgis, I can ask.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, well, so so our our approach uh at least machine learning from a completely different perspective. So we collaborate with some folks here uh trying to understand how nanoparticles will accumulate into tumors and what that actually means. And the problem at least from the perspective of the the domain experts is not necessarily that yes, this is a tumor, but it's more about the technology that's being developed. So if you use a a certain type of particle or contrast agent and suggest that this is tumor selective, the interpretation that's being presented at least in the primary literature is very biased by a lot of um I guess you could you could say misinterpretation that's that's been perpetuated over a couple of decades. So people will assume that certain types of materials will always accumulate in tumors and if it does, then yes, we have a tumor. So the problem is not necessarily just on the on the image interpretation side, but it's more about the the contrast agent itself. And so the way that we approach it is that the input that we need needs to be built up as well. It's not just a contrast agent, but it's more using some nanotech experts to suggest that okay, well, this contrast agent will also accumulate similarly to another contrast agent. So you have to put um a second uh piece of information into the input of the algorithm itself to suggest that if you see this kind of a trend, this is a false positive. So you're teaching it what a false positive is based on the material that you're using as a contrast agent right from the very start from the get go so that you don't end up with false positives at the end. So it's we're kind of more on the front end of things and and and in my field the domain experts that are lacking is more on the on the material well nanobio interaction side of things.",

That's one of the things that we look into. And there are clinical trials that suggest that you can use these contrast these nanoparticles as contrast agents for positive tumor detection and image guided surgery. And that's all very well and good. You can see the image, you can probably use AI to delineate the uh tumor boundary to be a little bit better. But there are secondary biological factors um that contribute to errors that haven't been considered right at the start. So we try and hit it on both ends, not just what the image actually tells us, but what the agent that we're administering, how that's going to interact with the tissue and how that then contributes to a false positive. And so then feeding in information about what false positive materials or materials that give false positives is actually going to look like when you finally get the image.",
