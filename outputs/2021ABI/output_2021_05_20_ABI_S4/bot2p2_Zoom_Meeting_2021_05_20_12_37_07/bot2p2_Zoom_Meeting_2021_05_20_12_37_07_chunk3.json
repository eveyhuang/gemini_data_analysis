Yeah, so I I well, you could take a pass if you want, but go ahead if you want to.",

I'm here actually um trying to learn some um questions or or abilities for AI that could help us to interpretate uh imaging and do imaging segmentation. So um I'm new to the AI field. We're trying to adopting uh different networks for um um training and uh one part of the research in my lab is we do uh label free imaging um such that there's um a ton of uh images but not so much specific contrast. So we're trying to use an AI to allow us to uh do specific imaging. Um so I guess the question I have is uh there are a lot of different networks out there. Um well with with or specifically with very fine um um um differences. Um but there's not much of the benchmark um to allow us to compare um unless we're trying to use our own data to train it and then um to compare with of course different uh um um basically to adopt each of the techniques and compare it with our own data. Um before that there's really no way to know specifically what would be the best candidate for us. Um and also another thing um related to um I guess the uh um um validity of the interpretation is uh what kind of signal noise ratios do we need as both training set and also the prediction set and um is there any uh limitations on resolutions um that we should be aware of um before we do the um training. So so I guess I'm here more of to uh looking to the possibilities and asking questions then then providing some of the insights. Sorry about that.",

Somewhere it's affecting it and I think uh this field is still very young because a lot of the work being done is very um very focused.",

Um, but we can but many of the techniques, many of the metrology, the way to evaluate them, you know, how do you get around ground truth? Those I think there's um, I don't want to say a menu, but there is I think a short list and for me, um, though I have a lot of things that I would like in the world, I would like everyone to have access to this really clear short list of how how do I do all these things. Um, oh one of the things um I I don't want to forget before time goes by is we should look at bullet number two. And to me can can we extend our AI pipeline so it's very long, so it starts with acquisition, starts with the patient. In fact, someone thing by us is called closed loop imaging where this is that this is the what the patient needs, the patient gets it all the way to getting it and then doing the interpretation. To me that's you have to extend your AI to go through that entire pipeline.",

Or uh you know, in medical imaging when the vendors develop something, they're pulling it off of all of their own image sets and then it's not generalizable to the other vendors. So when I was, you know, thinking about the first bullet point, it was like uh like what data is required? I mean, you kind of want all the things.
