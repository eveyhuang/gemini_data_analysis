In my opinion is the best because I don't really know if there really is going to be a ground truth at that point because everything to a certain extent is either uh subjective to the observer if there's a pathologist or to uh experimental bias or fluctuations if you're going to get false positives or false negatives in the in the markers or the genomics themselves.

And actually, I really like Paris's point and you worded that much better than I was going to. Um, but my first interactions with AI and microscopy was stuff to for noise removal and um improving resolution and lowering laser power and stuff and I was just blown away by that work. And but I have right the same we know we know physical and biological boundaries on these conditions and I would like to see more integration of that into AI like if I'm segmenting a cell and it puts the nucleus, you know, right up against the edge of the cell, that's probably not where the nucleus is, right? It's more in the center. So how can we incorporate these things that we know um are are biological or physical boundaries and have the AI say like flag that oh that can't be right. Let's try again. Um, I think that gets into your errors, you know, what errors do we tolerate and how can we improve and minimize those. ",

And so as a result, you don't need this lengthy training process, you don't need terabytes and terabytes of data, but what you can have to again sort of inform the end user if they don't have enough data is some sort of uncertainty quantification at the end. So for instance, if you're trying to do some kind of segmentation and you have your data set, you don't necessarily need to do a kind of calculation of how much data do I need, you just kind of give it to the algorithm, the algorithm does its few shot semi or self-supervised training and then at the end of that spits out, okay, here's the segmentation that I did and here's my certainty that it's correct.

So we collaborate with some folks here uh trying to understand how nanoparticles will accumulate into tumors and what that actually means. And the problem at least from the perspective of the the domain experts is not necessarily that yes, this is a tumor, but it's more about the technology that's being developed. So if you use a a certain type of particle or contrast agent and suggest that this is tumor selective, the interpretation that's being presented at least in the primary literature is very biased by a lot of um I guess you could you could say misinterpretation that's that's been perpetuated over a couple of decades. So people will assume that certain types of materials will always accumulate in tumors and if it does, then yes, we have a tumor. So the problem is not necessarily just on the on the image interpretation side, but it's more about the the contrast agent itself. And so the way that we approach it is that the input that we need needs to be built up as well. It's not just a contrast agent, but it's more using some nanotech experts to suggest that okay, well, this contrast agent will also accumulate similarly to another contrast agent. So you have to put um a second uh piece of information into the input of the algorithm itself to suggest that if you see this kind of a trend, this is a false positive. So you're teaching it what a false positive is based on the material that you're using as a contrast agent right from the very start from the get go so that you don't end up with false positives at the end. So it's we're kind of more on the front end of things and and and in my field the domain experts that are lacking is more on the on the material well nanobio interaction side of things. ",
