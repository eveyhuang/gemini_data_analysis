First as a resident, they have a textbook and they go through that textbook and they learn this is what a cancer looks like. This that's handcrafted. Get a little hand waving here. And then they sit with their attending radiologist and they read day in and day out and they're told, oh, you're wrong. No, that's a false positive. That's the deep learning and that's of the radiologist brain. And then we have different structures of the brain. Some are really good at finding Waldo and weirds Waldo and some aren't.
