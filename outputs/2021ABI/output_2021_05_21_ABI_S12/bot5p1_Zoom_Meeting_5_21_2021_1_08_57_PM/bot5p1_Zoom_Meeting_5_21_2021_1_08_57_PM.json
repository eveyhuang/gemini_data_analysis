So we're doing 3D imaging and tomography and I'll just read the questions that were posed to us. What are the bottlenecks that prevent rapid analysis of 3D image data sets? Pet and X-ray CT are widely used, but are there other imaging modalities that lend themselves to 3D analysis as well? What technological advances are needed to make these practical? Can multimodal approaches be used to take advantage of the best properties of each method? And so first um task is to identify um a recorder reporter. Is there anyone that would like to volunteer?",
