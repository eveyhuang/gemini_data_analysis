And we were looking at the functional MRI and optical imaging and they are each advantageous for certain aspects, but um by looking at the photo acoustic it seems to be better when we have the input signal from optical and attenuation will be um less concerned when we don't need to worry about the uh signal signal out from that uh skull attenuation by looking at the acoustic signature and this will actually enable us to push this imaging down to uh actually 1 millimeter down into the brain tissue. So, uh I think this is a combination of the optical and acoustic for the acoustic photo acoustic imaging. And maybe for the other things, I was also thinking about to use uh certain uh contrast agents and this is really something people have been looking at with uh maybe a different application for photo uh optogenetics operation and they seem to be able to get those non particle inside the brain. So maybe they can also be combined to uh help the multimodality imaging.",
