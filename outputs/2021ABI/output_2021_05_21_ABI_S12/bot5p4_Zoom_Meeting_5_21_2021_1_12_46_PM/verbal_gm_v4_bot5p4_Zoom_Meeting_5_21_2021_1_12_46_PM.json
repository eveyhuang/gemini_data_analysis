So I the just relevant to this topic what I'm kind of interested right now I would be interested is to have a iterative reconstruction method for phase contrast with the raw interferometric data. So as you know that phase contrast you have to derive so from the projections you have to derive the you know the attenuation image, the phase image and the scatter image and then you reconstruct and so if I could do it from the raw interference patterns it's very challenging because of the very computational requirements. Okay it's very high computational requirements. And I'm also interested in deep learning methods for that like for some of these reconstruction methods. And also I think that will help our phase contrast in in correcting some of the errors due to large you know grating artifacts. So you know like it can learn a lot of things that ordinary reconstruction methods would not. And as for just a quick addition that no that's okay yeah I think that's enough. ",

So you can tailor the spins depending on however you want and generate the different contrast for different parameters. So you do have million parameters and it all affects the contrast. So that you can tailor the acquisition for lung imaging, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be very better than x-ray. It can come close enough, maybe. Uh, but that is the limitation.
