Now, in there there is no real depth, but it's a multicellular organisms who are collecting across and then we're using multiple scattering to get higher resolution images. And then another context where I worked on it is more like subsurface, right, imaging, so we're underground. So it's a higher uh it's more used in in oil exploration or archaeological, there they also have a scattering of of wave. But it's exactly the same model in fact. Used but in the reflection regime. Right now I'm starting something with optical well they're building a new type of optical coherence but in fact a tomography where there is a sample rotation.",

Uh but one thought could be someone else has an idea related to this. Uh you know, how could you use this information? Um maybe as a prior information or or as for a combined multimodality. Here we are we are looking into these problems. So if you have ideas on this, I'd be very interested in learning more. Uh I've thought about ideas on combining with ultrasound. I think pet is another one. But I'm also very interested in thinking about optical properties. Uh how can you use this information?

Only solution I'm seeing is you can do the differential contrast easily, but you have to generate the differential contrast. In some problems the contrast occurs like in brain imaging, you're doing a task and or or you could you could be like doing something and there is a natural contrast in blood volume change, right? There is that's happening. But all problems don't lend to those contrast. So how do you how do you tackle this problem, right?",

For example, if you want to image a cell, then it depends on how many nanoparticles basically gets into the cells. So it define basically the resolution. But the other interesting aspect about nanoparticles is that the validity of the like the signal is okay, but it's not it it may not correspond with like what you're looking for. For example, we label like some cells with iron oxide nanoparticles and that cells we basically um put the reporter gene to basically activate that with luciferase. So we can also get a bioluminescence image of the of the cells that we inject them. So what happens was that even though when the cells are dead, you get the signal from oxide nanoparticles for like a few days. So when using nanoparticles, you can increase concentration, but at the same time you need to make sure that it's safe and you need to make sure that they don't affect the like the functionality of the cells or like activate some like uh I don't know something like apoptotic like pathways there. So for nanoparticles, I would say we always need another modality just to make sure that what we see is real.",

The bulk of them are meant to um do things like diagnosis stroke requires no contrast. diffusion weighted imaging, T2 weighted imaging can can make the stroke diagnosis. A lot of MRI right now is basically anatomic so that stroke is one where there's like functional data coming from the diffusion, but um the rest of them are mostly anatomy. So lumbar spine MRIs to look for whether or not there's a narrowed narrow frame where the nerve is coming out to say that's why this person's having, you know, pain. So they're it's pretty much workhorse anatomic technique with um high end contrast enhancement used for like tumor characterization, infection characterization. Um uh you don't even need it to do like gallbladder, you know, MRCP to characterize the biliary system. So and I think.",
