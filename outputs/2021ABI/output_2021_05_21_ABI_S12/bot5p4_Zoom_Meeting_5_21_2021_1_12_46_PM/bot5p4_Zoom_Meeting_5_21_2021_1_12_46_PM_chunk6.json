You know, as I kind of got to at the very beginning, my my issue is that there is a lot of data there's a lot of information that can be from pathology about the different biochemical processes that are in a tissue. It could also be a little bit at a higher scale like what cells are present in that tissue. So a little larger scale, cellular micron level or micrometer level. Um, and then how do you take that data set, that 3D data set from pathology across the tissue, you know, tissue clearing technique, whatever it is that gave you really nice resolution and correlate that with the the MRI signals, the spectroscopic signal, the pet signal and build this like map of like what what is actually going on? Is is the is the imaging signal reflective of some of the more detailed pathology.",

So you can't use one modality for all types of diseases you will end up and that's obvious. And for example, you lung imaging with MRI without using hyperpolarize it is it is really difficult and but you can get very well x-rays and CTs from for lung imaging. So that is my main problem. So it is disease specific. And the second thing if what what I would like to do is most likely to increase the accuracy accuracy because MRI, I'm an MRI physicist, multi contrast, flexible contrast acquisition. So you can tailor the spins depending on however you want and generate the different contrast for different parameters. So you do have million parameters and it all affects the contrast. So that you can tailor the acquisition for lung imaging, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be very better than x-ray. It can come close enough, maybe. Uh, but that is the limitation. We all know that. So that is most likely I might contribute to this question in a way that I can accelerate and the acquisition and increase the accuracy of the findings.",

It's it takes advantage of just the host of light based technologies we have available and we wouldn't have biomedical research without that. So how do you connect these clinically accessible imaging modalities like MRI where you can't see anything. You can see structures, you can tag a few things, maybe some spectroscopy, but compared to what light can do, it's just the the tiniest scratch, um, mechanistically speaking. So how do you relate those two imaging modalities to get the maximum value from an a a research and analytical modality and a more clinically accessible or clinically relevant modality. I think for me that's that's always been my sort of challenge, uh, coming up as was trained as a as a biologist and then went into biophysics. How do you connect those two things?",
