We're looking at blood flow, we're looking at a bleed, etc. Now in the in the contrast enhance space, it's not as commonly used because it's not that necessary, but uh these gadolinium agents and these targeted agents, they're highly limited because they are they have to carry a large molecule around with them. So they're highly limited to mostly vascular targets. We're looking for some vascular marker of whatever that is, or we're counting on um your agent leaking out of the blood to to mark whatever you're going for. And that's again very limiting in in the standard sort of T1, T2 uh regime.",

And in those situations it's almost like there's no reason to do that 3D because you know where you're putting it. It's uh it's almost academic to say that the imaging is not invasive because the delivery is definitely not uh invasive.",
