So I the just relevant to this topic what I'm kind of interested right now I would be interested is to have a iterative reconstruction method for phase contrast with the raw interferometric data. So as you know that phase contrast you have to derive so from the projections you have to derive the you know the attenuation image, the phase image and the scatter image and then you reconstruct and so if I could do it from the raw interference patterns it's very challenging because of the very computational requirements. Okay it's very high computational requirements. And I'm also interested in deep learning methods for that like for some of these reconstruction methods. And also I think that will help our phase contrast in in correcting some of the errors due to large you know grating artifacts. So you know like it can learn a lot of things that ordinary reconstruction methods would not. And as for just a quick addition that no that's okay yeah I think that's enough. ",

But the other interesting aspect about nanoparticles is that the validity of the like the signal is okay, but it's not it it may not correspond with like what you're looking for. For example, we label like some cells with iron oxide nanoparticles and that cells we basically um put the reporter gene to basically activate that with luciferase. So we can also get a bioluminescence image of the of the cells that we inject them. So what happens was that even though when the cells are dead, you get the signal from oxide nanoparticles for like a few days. So when using nanoparticles, you can increase concentration, but at the same time you need to make sure that it's safe and you need to make sure that they don't affect the like the functionality of the cells or like activate some like uh I don't know something like apoptotic like pathways there.

It could also be a little bit at a higher scale like what cells are present in that tissue. So a little larger scale, cellular micron level or micrometer level. Um, and then how do you take that data set, that 3D data set from pathology across the tissue, you know, tissue clearing technique, whatever it is that gave you really nice resolution and correlate that with the the MRI signals, the spectroscopic signal, the pet signal and build this like map of like what what is actually going on?

So it is disease specific. And the second thing if what what I would like to do is most likely to increase the accuracy accuracy because MRI, I'm an MRI physicist, multi contrast, flexible contrast acquisition. So you can tailor the spins depending on however you want and generate the different contrast for different parameters. So you do have million parameters and it all affects the contrast. So that you can tailor the acquisition for lung imaging, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be very better than x-ray. It can come close enough, maybe. Uh, but that is the limitation.
