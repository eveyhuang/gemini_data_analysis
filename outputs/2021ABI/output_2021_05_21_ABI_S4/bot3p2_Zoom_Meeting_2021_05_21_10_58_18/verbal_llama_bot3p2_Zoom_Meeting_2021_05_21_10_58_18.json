So uh my personal interest in science is image guided therapy for metastatic cancers. Um 90% of people die from metastasis and not primary tumors. So we need to really treat metastasis and prevent them if possible. So that's that's the goal of my research. Um in the beginning of my career, I used uh iron oxide nanoparticles as contrast agents uh to detect tumors and now we're using them actually as uh carriers as vehicles to deliver therapies and as imaging reporters as well. That's why it's image guided therapy. So that's it. Um I mean I can take tell you more but I think we should try to keep it short.
