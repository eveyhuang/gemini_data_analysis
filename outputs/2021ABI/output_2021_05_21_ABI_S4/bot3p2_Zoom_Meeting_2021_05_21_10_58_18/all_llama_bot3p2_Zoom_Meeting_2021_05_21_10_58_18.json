So uh my personal interest in science is image guided therapy for metastatic cancers. Um 90% of people die from metastasis and not primary tumors. So we need to really treat metastasis and prevent them if possible. So that's that's the goal of my research. Um in the beginning of my career, I used uh iron oxide nanoparticles as contrast agents uh to detect tumors and now we're using them actually as uh carriers as vehicles to deliver therapies and as imaging reporters as well. That's why it's image guided therapy. So that's it. Um I mean I can take tell you more but I think we should try to keep it short. So um I'm just going to go the way I see people on the screen so no or oh no, I do have a list here. Okay, let's just go alphabetically. Benjamin.",

I am a developmental uh molecular and cell biologist and my research focuses on on understanding um the roles of transcription factors and cell cell adhesion molecules in regulating the process of thealmal transition. So I study neural crest cells um and those cells are really dynamic and they make a lot of different um adult tissues, but probably more relevant to this group, uh all of the molecular mechanisms that allow those cells to undergo EMT are then re uh reused by cancer cells to metastasize. And so what we are doing in my lab is really trying to get at the basal function of the proteins that allow these cells to undergo EMT and to migrate and differentiate and then um at least my postdoc is really interested in trying to define whether those functions um are conserved in disease states. And so we do a lot of fixed and live imaging of these cells to get at um how the collective migration works um and and the paths that these cells take and then um hopefully how that's affected by perturbations of these different proteins.",

So I'm very interesting this session uh the reason I've never done anything like image guided therapies before, but uh I'm very curious how can I contribute? How can I use label free imaging, how can I use optics and algorithms to enable point of procedure diagnosis uh or point of procedure real time monitoring of the therapeutic process. Uh, what role would resolution of cellular dynamics mean in the in the process of imaging guided uh therapies.",

And so we have a really uh significant issue if we focus on one model organism and there's no confirmation of of pathways, molecular pathways for treatments. And so as you mentioned, something can be targeted in the mouse and never works in the human and doing research with model organisms, even closely related ones, I can tell you that even within the same order, there's no guarantee that these species have um kind of the same that there's not the mechanistic processes aren't the same. So I think we need a lot more basic level research to really define what the conserved pathways that drive these processes of say EMT, cell migration, metastasis are, um, before we can jump to treating humans and and we have to have both of those at the same time in my opinion.",

It turned out that, you know, sitting in millimolar glucose, which is what you have to do for the cells to survive, completely wrecks their metabolism in terms of you know, what we're looking for. So it is really easy to get to be misled by those holes. I'm not saying they're bad, but it's very easy to get misled because then you think they're real, but something that's required for the culture conditions um ruins everything. And for someone who works in neuroimmunity, like the microglia that I focus on, they know when they're in culture. They know when they're being looked at and they change their their gene transcription. So those things have been have been very frustrating for for my personal kind of work.",

I mean from the like the biological point of view, it makes perfect sense that they don't basically recapitulate what happens in vivo. But like from the physical point of view, it would be another story like different organs have different stiffness. They have like different properties and all of those things needs also to be considered in the in vitro setting. Like with the advances in the 3D bioprinting and like making like um uh pattern soft that can basically provide opportunity for cells to basically make a 3D structures rather than like the flat surface uh 2D structure. All of those can be of a great help for getting more meaningful and robust in vitro data. So I think for that purpose maybe a group of scientists that have different looks into the same problem needs to collaborate to each other to basically make a perfect in vitro like setting that can be more close to the in vivo one.",

And for the nanotechnology, I mean, we are working on the field of nanomedicine for a couple of years and like one of the main problems that we have for delivery and also for like using them as a contrast agent is their interactions with biological systems. So what happens is that what we makes in like laboratories are totally different from what we see like when they interact with the plasma proteins or any type of biological fluids. So what happens is that different types of biomolecules comes to the surface of nanoparticles and interact with them and basically form a corona around the surface of nanoparticles. So based on the type of the proteins, amount of the proteins, conformational changes of the proteins, basically we have totally different fate for the nanoparticles. So it can affect imaging, it can affect targeting, it can affect safety of the nanoparticles and those things basically leads to be considered in the imaging like procedures because you can imagine when you have additional layer at the surface of like nanoparticles, if you use that nanoparticles as a carrier, so what happens is that they can affect drug release or if you have like a fluorophore or something like that then what happens is that we may have like some unwanted interactions with those like labeling species that can affect the like the imaging capacity.

So I think there is there's the whole field of, you know, having nanoparticles in the body and and Morteza really nicely outlined also several of the challenges that come with that. Um, and I think some of uh, you know, what I think is kind of a new direction in using nanotechnology is actually, um, not necessarily having it interact directly in the body, but having it manipulate the light with which you illuminate uh, the part the biological species you want to see and actually then using light itself as a marker. Um and some of the things I I'd also love to get people's perspective on there is, um, for example also as Morteza was saying, there are new ways where you can better um model the tissue in three dimensions and actually get effects such as the extracellular matrix. Um and and for instance in breast cancer metastasis, the extracellular matrix actually plays a really critical role. So, um, I'm curious to know how do people image that today? Because I think using sophisticated nano optics, it would be potentially possible to monitor then uh changes in the extracellular matrix um more easily and maybe also find new perspectives on the effectiveness of treatments for example.",
