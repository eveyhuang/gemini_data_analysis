Um, we're interested in uh infectious diseases, uh especially bacterial infection. Um, how do we monitor the bacteria flowing around a person or an animal and uh what what um inferences can we draw about that basic pathology that we can't do at this point. And another the other component is really around imaging gene and cell therapies and if we can image it and control it then perhaps we can get into that, you know, positive feedback loop of modulating something in the therapy and then seeing how that changes. So, um, thanks.",

Uh, I did my PhD in UIUC uh in label free microscopy. And then I did my uh postdoc in Berkeley in computational imaging. So my new lab uh the goal is to see how to use optics and algorithms to enable breakthroughs in biomedicine, especially the clinical adoption of microscopy in different uh biomedical situations like early cancer diagnosis, image guided therapies and neuro imaging. So I'm very interesting this session uh the reason I've never done anything like image guided therapies before, but uh I'm very curious how can I contribute? How can I use label free imaging, how can I use optics and algorithms to enable point of procedure diagnosis uh or point of procedure real time monitoring of the therapeutic process. Uh, what role would resolution of cellular dynamics mean in the in the process of imaging guided uh therapies.",
