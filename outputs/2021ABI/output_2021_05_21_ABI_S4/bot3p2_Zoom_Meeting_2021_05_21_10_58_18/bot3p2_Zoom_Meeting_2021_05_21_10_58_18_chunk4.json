So I think I think the ideas is is is really important and how do we develop things that are able to sense drug delivery.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, before can I comment on that? So before going to nanotechnology, I just wanted to add one more thing and it's that like the problems of the in vitro makes sense from different angles when you look at it. I mean from the like the biological point of view, it makes perfect sense that they don't basically recapitulate what happens in vivo. But like from the physical point of view, it would be another story like different organs have different stiffness. They have like different properties and all of those things needs also to be considered in the in vitro setting. Like with the advances in the 3D bioprinting and like making like um uh pattern soft that can basically provide opportunity for cells to basically make a 3D structures rather than like the flat surface uh 2D structure. All of those can be of a great help for getting more meaningful and robust in vitro data. So I think for that purpose maybe a group of scientists that have different looks into the same problem needs to collaborate to each other to basically make a perfect in vitro like setting that can be more close to the in vivo one.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, exactly. These are basically the concept of the lab on a chip which basically again it's a kind of multidisciplinary thing. And for the nanotechnology, I mean, we are working on the field of nanomedicine for a couple of years and like one of the main problems that we have for delivery and also for like using them as a contrast agent is their interactions with biological systems. So what happens is that what we makes in like laboratories are totally different from what we see like when they interact with the plasma proteins or any type of biological fluids. So what happens is that different types of biomolecules comes to the surface of nanoparticles and interact with them and basically form a corona around the surface of nanoparticles. So based on the type of the proteins, amount of the proteins, conformational changes of the proteins, basically we have totally different fate for the nanoparticles. So it can affect imaging, it can affect targeting, it can affect safety of the nanoparticles and those things basically leads to be considered in the imaging like procedures because you can imagine when you have additional layer at the surface of like nanoparticles, if you use that nanoparticles as a carrier, so what happens is that they can affect drug release or if you have like a fluorophore or something like that then what happens is that we may have like some unwanted interactions with those like labeling species that can affect the like the imaging capacity. So from a nanotechnology perspective, I would say we need more information about like the protein corona and how it can affect the safety and biological like fate of nanoparticles.",

            "transcript": "So maybe also to follow up on Morteza's point, um, so in my research I focus a little bit more on using nanotechnology to manipulate the light. So I think there is there's the whole field of, you know, having nanoparticles in the body and and Morteza really nicely outlined also several of the challenges that come with that. Um, and I think some of uh, you know, what I think is kind of a new direction in using nanotechnology is actually, um, not necessarily having it interact directly in the body, but having it manipulate the light with which you illuminate uh, the part the biological species you want to see and actually then using light itself as a marker. Um and some of the things I I'd also love to get people's perspective on there is, um, for example also as Morteza was saying, there are new ways where you can better um model the tissue in three dimensions and actually get effects such as the extracellular matrix. Um and and for instance in breast cancer metastasis, the extracellular matrix actually plays a really critical role. So, um, I'm curious to know how do people image that today? Because I think using sophisticated nano optics, it would be potentially possible to monitor then uh changes in the extracellular matrix um more easily and maybe also find new perspectives on the effectiveness of treatments for example.",
