I'm a professor and assistant dean at the College of Human Medicine. Uh prior to joining MSU, which was about three years ago, uh my career all my career pretty much went at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School that I joined as postdoctoral fellow and by the time I left I was a professor at Harvard Medical School, professor in radiology. So uh my personal interest in science is image guided therapy for metastatic cancers. Um 90% of people die from metastasis and not primary tumors. So we need to really treat metastasis and prevent them if possible. So that's that's the goal of my research. Um in the beginning of my career, I used uh iron oxide nanoparticles as contrast agents uh to detect tumors and now we're using them actually as uh carriers as vehicles to deliver therapies and as imaging reporters as well. That's why it's image guided therapy. So that's it. Um I mean I can take tell you more but I think we should try to keep it short. So um I'm just going to go the way I see people on the screen so no or oh no, I do have a list here. Okay, let's just go alphabetically. Benjamin.",

Uh but I also like to think about how all of that vascular infrastructure supports or doesn't support healthy neural function.

And so my my lab we kind of took that interest in in the skeleton to ask a very simple question. How does a heart grow on a single cell level? Meaning how does a single heart muscle cell physically get bigger? And that is one of the main drivers of our lab. Uh and so we are kind of all over the place.

Uh but uh most importantly we try to understand what happens at the surface of nanoparticles. So for that purpose we combine cryo transmission electron microscopy and uh 3D constructed imaging model to basically see the 3D structure of the nanoparticles and how they interact with proteins and at the larger scale how they interact with different cell types and what are their uh trafficking inside the cells. So uh basically in terms of imaging we are focused on MRI uh transmission electron microscopy like I said and super resolution microscopy.",

I think most relevant to this meeting in some is some work I'm pursuing on physics based filtering of um uh in vivo MRI uh with a focus on 4D flow MRI and reconstructing blood flow and uh measurements in a way that the underlying physics is satisfied. So principles like mass and momentum conservation and then using those principles to infer auxiliary measurements that um cannot be measured by imaging such as blood pressure, uh shear stresses, um uh and so forth. So the idea there is really to understand the role of hemodynamics in determining organ function and uh you know, predicting biomarkers that are relevant to cardiovascular disease.",

I am a developmental uh molecular and cell biologist and my research focuses on on understanding um the roles of transcription factors and cell cell adhesion molecules in regulating the process of thealmal transition. So I study neural crest cells um and those cells are really dynamic and they make a lot of different um adult tissues, but probably more relevant to this group, uh all of the molecular mechanisms that allow those cells to undergo EMT are then re uh reused by cancer cells to metastasize. And so what we are doing in my lab is really trying to get at the basal function of the proteins that allow these cells to undergo EMT and to migrate and differentiate and then um at least my postdoc is really interested in trying to define whether those functions um are conserved in disease states. And so we do a lot of fixed and live imaging of these cells to get at um how the collective migration works um and and the paths that these cells take and then um hopefully how that's affected by perturbations of these different proteins.",
