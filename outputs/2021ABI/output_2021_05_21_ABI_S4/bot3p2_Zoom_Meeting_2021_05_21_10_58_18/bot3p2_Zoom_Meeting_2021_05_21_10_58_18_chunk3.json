And so we have a really uh significant issue if we focus on one model organism and there's no confirmation of of pathways, molecular pathways for treatments. And so as you mentioned, something can be targeted in the mouse and never works in the human and doing research with model organisms, even closely related ones, I can tell you that even within the same order, there's no guarantee that these species have um kind of the same that there's not the mechanistic processes aren't the same. So I think we need a lot more basic level research to really define what the conserved pathways that drive these processes of say EMT, cell migration, metastasis are, um, before we can jump to treating humans and and we have to have both of those at the same time in my opinion.",

So so making basically um so so from you know, my reading and talking to some collaborators it seems like people are getting better at making in vitro models of of the human also for drug testing for example. So does that help maybe avoid some animal models or is that completely often brings along a whole other set of challenges? What's kind of the latest um state of the art there?",

Um, we got all kinds of interesting data and addition then I went to go validate with some metabolic imaging, just nothing alike. Not even slightly. And so then we just did all the experiments over again and it told a completely different story. It turned out that, you know, sitting in millimolar glucose, which is what you have to do for the cells to survive, completely wrecks their metabolism in terms of you know, what we're looking for. So it is really easy to get to be misled by those holes. I'm not saying they're bad, but it's very easy to get misled because then you think they're real, but something that's required for the culture conditions um ruins everything. And for someone who works in neuroimmunity, like the microglia that I focus on, they know when they're in culture. They know when they're being looked at and they change their their gene transcription. So those things have been have been very frustrating for for my personal kind of work.",

Uh, I have not been following up how well that really translates to the patient's recovery because of course that takes a long time to track.

Just surviving and making similar cell types is what we're looking for here.
