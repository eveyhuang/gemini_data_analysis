So like, you know, this was there's image guided therapies being here. People have developed fluorescent probes to thing like folate receptor or looking at um, ICG for various lung cancers.

Great, we're building a theranostic that's going to find the T cells and report back to us that it's done a job in there. So we have there is a way of bypassing some of that initial safety testing if you do go with these um, biologics or just antibodies that are already approved. So there there's some hope there and I think the as we get better and better at this, we may start building out something like a grass list, you know, it's like generally recognized as safe list, something like this for biologics.",
