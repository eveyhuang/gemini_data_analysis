I think you know, I think we discussed a lot of different questions because the topic is so broad. And um if you guys you know, if you guys want to talk more about it, you know, my email is there. Uh you can email me or you can email each other. Please, um and uh hopefully we'll get this going and uh I'm looking forward to forming proposals from you guys just think what what you want to do. Um, you have complimentary expertise. Um, so we have a clinical person here. That's unique. So grab his expertise before too late. So it's going to end in 56 seconds. Anything else you want to add to this? Maybe some farewell notes.",
