And so I'm interested in a lot of these ideas that are coming up here as to how to yeah link together all sorts of different types of data sets and this was touched upon in the previous session as well. Um but also how to get more information out of our our images and and set of images and I'm really interested in learning how to optimize this um as we start to collect these really huge data sets.

I've been there for about three years now. And my lab is a cell biology lab. We do a lot of imaging and uh we ask the questions of how local signaling dynamics result in cell shape changes during cell migration. We do that in individually migrating cells and in collectively migrating cells. So there's this scale issue of of molecular organelles and cells and super cellular structures where we try to to bridge those different domains by using different modes of microscopy. So my lab relies a lot of on on on live cell imaging and I think uh for us it's a bottleneck to to do quantitative uh imaging. We do like cell edge tracking, cell tracking but but we would like to have better ways and faster ways of developing um analysis modalities that suit our questions and it's they're always changing so so one needs to adapt these um algorithms quickly and that's something that I'm hoping to to discuss more uh in this group.",

I primarily work with magnetic resonance imaging to uh visualize inflammation and uh response to a cancer response to therapy uh using either iron oxide nanoparticles or fluorine imaging. And one of the limitations specific specifically in iron oxides is you do see a signal change on your image that is quantitative, but you cannot really correlate it to the number of cells that have influxed in the area. So I would be interested in uh developing things like this.",

So I'm looking forward to a great conversation. Before we get going, we need a uh and for those who just joined, I think it was Vivian and Fanny, we did spend the first minute kind of thinking at those bullet points and jotting down on our own thoughts if you want to do that.",
