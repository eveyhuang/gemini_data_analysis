Uh basically we are developing, we are developing the optical imaging platform and we integrate the Raman based microscopy such as stimulated Raman microscopy and with the multiphoton fluorescence microscopy together. So this is a multimodality imaging system not only allow us to visualize the metabolic activities such as those small metabolites like glucose, amino acids or fatty acids, we can directly visualize them because the isotope we add onto those small metabolites will form the new chemical bond, which is uh for example carbon deuterium bond, so we don't need to do click chemistry to add the bulky fluorescence probe anymore. So this layer of metabolic information uh can be visualized at the same time we want to see for example the calcium fluorescence signal in the same region of interest. So this uh combined imaging platform can be used to solve some biological questions such as neurovascular coupling system. Uh for example we we are so interested in how neuron talk to those other type of cells such as endothelial cells on the vasculature system like the the uh blood brain barrier for example. So uh another layer of information that we couldn't really uh image because of the technical limitation is how the endothelial cell from the vasculature system signaling back to the the neuron and uh how these like feedback uh feedbacks the circuits that work. So uh if we combine both the Raman based imaging with the multiphoton fluorescence imaging together then we can visualize both layers of information at the same time specially and temporarily for in vivo imaging.",

But I mean it seems like Nick has this interesting um system where he's able to look at cilia uh that maybe doesn't require those sorts of labeling so I'm curious what maybe that would be an an easier one to scale up speed with some kind of camera based method.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, so so thanks for showing some interest in it. to traditionally if you need to image cilia that are beating, which is the most challenging situation, they're beating at anywhere from 20 hertz to some extreme protest that live in the sea can beat up to 150 hertz. So that's that's a different story. And typically you're imaging them if you if you need to do temporal imaging, you need to image them at around 100 hertz to get reliable, you know, wave forms. And so we do that with DIC. So DIC microscopy with just a camera is the best way to track the ciliary wave form. Um, but then if you want to track trafficking within this bending whip like wave form, that's where you need to do fluorescence. And so what the field has done is that they've either taken cilia that are beating and immobilized them pharmacologically so that they're not beating and then track protein trafficking within them, but that's such a major perturbation that, you know, we still don't know what protein trafficking within a beating cilium looks like because of that. So one thing, yeah, I don't know, you know, now you can do the combined DIC fluorescence, you know, that's not a challenging technique, but getting enough signal is then that becomes the challenge. So getting enough signal from what could be one to five proteins and part of like a particle train, um, to get enough signal from that to reliably track it within the wave form would seem to be what would be needed.",

So like one one rapid prototyping approach would be to use tetrahymena, which have a thousand cilia and they're easy to manipulate and they're genetic and you can you can either immobilize them so they're because the other side of this is that if it's happening in a moving cell, there's another set of translation. So it's a beating cilia on a moving cell, so that would be a different thing. So you can immobilize them, um, the the cells, not the cilia. And then if you do that, you can get a glancing blow of the side cilia where you can image just through an individual one. Um, I can show an example if if you'd like, uh, I can I can share screen.",

So here is an example of of the DIC type images that you can get and these this is acquired at 600 frames per second. And so we can slow down the wave form and we can track it, but now imagine trying to track a particle moving within that. Um, that's that seems to be the the the problem and I haven't seen anybody even come close to doing it. Again, one thing that people would do is they would maybe treat this with a drug that makes the cilia stop beating and then track them, but you know, that's that's the barrier. So some way to combine the DIC with fluorescence at the 100 to 200 hertz imaging frame would seem to be what would be needed.",
