Um and I I mean yeah, I don't know how how feasible that would be within that type of cell.",

Uh related to Arnold um comment the the computational multiplexing or kind of an internal reference. I think that has been used also in a lot of other settings, for example, in cell migration, right? Like the the rather than turn like the the the edge of the cell could serve as a internal reference in some context as well. So I guess related to uh either the optogenetic tattooing or some cell features that serve as internal reference. Um can we think about linking different modalities? Uh I think Lingyan has something to say.",

And that allow us to do computational algorithm to do clustering, clustering out the same similar spectrum groups of the pixels. So if group one have this same Raman spectrum, then these pixels will be assigned to uh for example red color, one color. And group two, we we cluster out again and we assign different second color. Uh then there's no limitation as long as we can group out uh a group of of spectrum profile, we can assign a color for that specific group of molecule. So the the in the end, each pixel, there is a dominating molecule signal. Dominating molecule signal is um the the the final assigned color.",

And I'm curious, is there a way to if you wanted to label so that you could mark a subcellular compartment with fluorescence, right? Because maybe, you know, you're you're you know, I know you can you can you can separate mitochondria and nucleus, you know, things big structures really well. But if you wanted to label something like say a cilium so that you could identify it with fluorescence and then image the cilium with Raman, how can you separate out the fluorescence from the Raman signal? And if so, like that that seems like a really cool multimodal approach to be able to say here's a cellular compartment. Now what is the biochemical makeup of this compartment would be something that could be really interesting.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, so that is exactly what what I just talked about in the beginning. Uh for example the the neuro neurovascular coupling system that I was talking about, you have the calcium signal which is fluorescence based. So it's a photon that emitted from the molecule. But at the same time, we look at the same region of interest with Raman signal. So that is chemical bound vibrational modes. So we can collect different modalities in the same you know even same region of interest and it doesn't influence each other because it's it's different imaging modality. So then for for that do you do you use like the regular 488 laser for Gcamp excitation and then you use like an infrared laser for the Raman signal? Is that what you do?",

So I use the same laser to do the the pump for the size imaging, but use the same wavelength to do the two photon fluorescence for for Gcamp or for other fluorescence signal. So other fluorescence signal can be uh can be imaged by two photon fluorescence very well. For example the the the one that we usually talk about like label free NADH or flavor molecules and we can quickly just image with two photon fluorescence in the same you know even same region of interest. And it doesn't influence each other because it's it's different imaging modality.",
