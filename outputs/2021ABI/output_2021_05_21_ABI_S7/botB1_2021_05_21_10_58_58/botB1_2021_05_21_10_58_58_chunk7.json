So what I had contributed was that I also have have another simultaneous equation where um I describe the oxygen partial pressure. I would get that from the spec imaging, okay?

Yeah, we that would actually be perfect um for some of the stuff we work on. We there's we have this inexplicable we're working on an aged mouse model and so I think the the pictures up on the on the picture board or whatever, but you know, I get this higher bone mineral density and the regenerated bone. It's direct ossification. There's no cartilage intermediate. I get this um really high bone mineral density and it's in very specific places. And so the man handle or the woman handling of the microCT stacks and trying to actually align um where that is in relation to the histology, I can sort of reverse the spaces and then do CD31 and and say okay, that's an endothelial space but being able to correlate some of this high bone mineral density to what's around it, which presumably is either nerve or vascular space, um would actually lead to what the mechanism is that's underlying that, particularly if I can go in and sort of um look at that in terms of spatial transcriptomics and be able to say like, yeah, there's my you know, there's my vasculature and there's my osteoblast and you can see that it correlates like when we look at this in 2D. But um, we haven't been able to successfully take these CT stacks and be able to mathematically show it. I mean, I think the field hasn't really either because you end up with all these figures are just like, hey, it kind of looks like this. And then just hope somebody doesn't ask for some sort of quantification for it. You just sort of go, oh, we can't do it. Um, so but but I I think that's really needed um to be able to, you know, find out better ways to if you could do that, I mean, you could basically target where you where you want to interosseous growth for like prosthetic integration and stuff, which would be really nice.",

It says that it it won't preview the file and I can't load it. the same thing happened yesterday. so Oh, maybe we're having maybe it's there's so many people trying to put stuff in. Uh wait for a couple minutes or uh share it with someone else and another person can try. I I I haven't seen this problem in the previously, but it looks like we're getting enough people working in the document that it's um it's not making it as easy as we as it usually is or what we hoped for. So uh bear with us for a little bit. Don't if you if you're ready to paste something in but you guys want to talk some more, don't waste the time, please please do that.",
