One could also say, okay, let's just look at what cells naturally do and then identify particular um for example, movement patterns and during specific movement patterns make that as a detection um point of detection where you say like, okay, this is the this is the event. So that's more more like using using a a set of features that have that have to happen in order to to detect the event and then and then focus focus in um",

            "transcript": "So we've done this with snapshot RNA fish data. So the problem with RNA fish strategy is you have to kill the sample. But often the if you measure say 100 cells and you perturb them and then you measure them at similar time points, you actually get very repeatable behavior often for certain gene networks. So it turns out you can actually link the snapshot data using some modeling ideas. So these come more from control theory, so they're things like chemical master equation and these other things. What's really interesting about them is you can actually predict if you take enough data what the cells might do under a new stimuli or you can predict which time points you should then measure to reduce your uncertainty. So you can do sort of a coarser set of experiments and then predict like where do I need to fill in to understand the dynamics in my system better. And we actually showed that you can do this well enough where you can extract say um elongation rates of RNA from these snapshot data. So then we went back into the line system and actually measured the elongation rate and actually showed we got it right from the computational inference. The the problem we run into there again is we just started with an overwhelming amount of data. So we're stuck to this idea of like, can we it's really easy to start from this overwhelming data, specify a model and say I should have measured here. I think it gets much harder to start from a sort of first principles modeling and say this is where I need to be doing my measurements to learn the most over space and time and that problem I think is is still really challenging and I don't have a good handle on the best way to approach it.

So the the case study for the cilia, having a lot of approaches would apply to viruses as well because they are the cilia is like uh uh the little filaments on the cell. So the virus would attach on those. So the movement of the cilia kind of reflects uh sort of the movement of the virus particle on the cell before they enter. Uh and also the uh I think the uh user guided imaging where where you uh you focus where with a with a bigger field and then you zoom in on a smaller field. That's exactly what I would looking for. And I think if we can I think that it it it definitely would help with the uh photo bleaching or photo toxicity uh problem so that with a uh bigger field we don't need we uh we kind of spread out the intensity of the of the lasers. But uh once we find an interesting field, we can zoom it in then we only look at that small part and look at it at super resolution and that way we can keep the cell alive while we're imaging. So yes, that was the thing I found most interesting from that from this discussion.",
