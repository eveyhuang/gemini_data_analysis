And I found that some mutations can cause proteins to misfold, which can lead to disease. I'm currently working on a paper that describes these findings. I'm hoping to submit it to a journal in the next few weeks. I'm also planning to present these findings at a conference in the fall. I'm really excited about this project, and I think it has the potential to make a significant contribution to our understanding of protein folding and disease.",
