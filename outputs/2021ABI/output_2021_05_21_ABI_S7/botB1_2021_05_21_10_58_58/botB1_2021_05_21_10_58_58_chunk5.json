So we're interested in how proteins are organized in cells and how that organization affects their function. And we're also interested in how that organization is regulated by different signaling pathways. So we use super resolution microscopy to visualize proteins at the nanoscale and then we use computational methods to analyze the data and extract information about protein organization and function. And we're also interested in developing new super resolution microscopy methods that can be used to study proteins in living cells.",
