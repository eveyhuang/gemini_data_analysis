And uh the reason I think I was probably put in this group is because I I'm very interested in protein trafficking within small structures known as cilia and cilia are diffraction limited and they're really important for a lot of developmental clinical things so they they receive Sonic Hedgehog signaling and so that's really important for patterning. And what's interesting is that the cilia generally in terms of human mutations, they're not they're not abolished so they're still present but there's just minor defects in trafficking within the cilia and to the cilia. And so this has only been studied so far for the most part, the hardcore trafficking stuff has only been studied in static cells that aren't moving or in cilia that aren't moving but in a developing organism clearly they are moving. And so something that the field needs is to be able to study cilia trafficking in either a cilia that's beating because sometimes they beat back and forth to generate flow. Um that's really challenging because they can beat up to 15 to 20 hertz. So trying to image a diffraction limited spot and something that's beating at 20 hertz uh would be a challenge and so that's the kind of stuff that I'm interested in. I have the biological expertise and I can do, you know, I do fluorescence imaging and and live cell imaging and super resolution imaging and stuff like that. But um I think that that problem will need something beyond that. So thanks. ",

So the the main challenge related to the topic of this breakout session um in the context of my research is I think to link molecular events to subcellular events and to super cellular events. So so it's kind of the we need to understand what's happening at the molecular level um what is happening with for example polymerizing acting structures um but they happen at a very very fast time scale and uh cells move at a much much slower cells time scale. So uh the the big challenge then is to to link uh these molecular events to the larger um cellular outcomes. And um I don't quite know how to do that because you know if we if we monitor on single molecules we we can probably do that. Um but how do we know that which molecular signal event would then translate into a cell for example to polarize as a whole which happens on the scale of tens of minutes. So that would be something to to think about. And regarding this this um other question of uh how can we collect simultaneously at different times of resolution I I guess um one could think of of um imaging live cell imaging streams where you resolve where you try to monitor events at a relatively low resolution and then have online um automated image analysis that ident identifies relevant events zooms in goes at really high uh imaging frequency so um this is something that we don't do but but that we that I thought could be something of interest of course the technical challenges to overcome and and developing a robust workflow for for doing this.

I was trained as a molecularologist and uh worked in a biophysical lab on super resolution imaging on virus host interactions. So my lab uh I built a single molecule of polarization microscope to look at uh virus uh life cycle. Uh so far I have um so one of my question is uh when the virus replicates on the ER structure close to the nuclei uh nuclei and we uh by so our super resolution microscopy lose the ability to uh resolve those uh replication complex uh in 3D. So we can only do kind of turf. Uh so I'm hoping that uh if there's some methods that we can we can we can we can uh see those very small structures deep in the cell uh with high contrast. So I know that there are tradeoffs between um spatial resolution and the photo uh phototoxicity and as well as the floor for um you know, photon budget. So I think maybe a new floor for um uh that would be helpful and also uh adaptive imaging, for example, that you only uh activate the floor for that on your focal point will all the others uh you do not activate. So that's uh some uh some thoughts I have. Uh and also I am uh uh I really like to look at the dynamics of the virus moving um on the surface of the cells or moving from the inside to the out of the cells. So uh the challenge in here would be the temporal resolution. So um so far we use uh millisecond resolution to track the viruses, but I think there are some very tiny or detailed movements of these virus on the cell surface before they enter or before they enter the cells. So uh and also because virus are so small, they're like 100 to between 100 to 200 nanometers. So then that will require uh high spatial and temporal resolution to resolve those questions.

I'm in neurobiology at UC San Diego and in my lab uh we're really interested in how neural activity across the brain uh generates behaviors. And so I use microscopy because it's a great system to observe neural activity and I use small transgenic or small transparent fish species so that we can observe activity across the brain and uh without any kind of surgery using uh fluorescent sensors of neural activity like voltage or calcium. And one thing that I think is really important that neuroscience in general is trying to get at is how to link multiple levels of uh looking at the brain such as looking at the activity or the anatomy or what cells are connected to each other or what genes they express. And it's difficult to look at all these with the same method. So I've, you know, worked on some uh approaches to try and register different types of data together so we can look at the same cells under different conditions where we'll look at live uh neural activity imaging in an animal that's behaving and then we take the same animal, we fix it and we do, you know, multiple rounds of in situ hybridization to look at the genes expressed in those same cells using image registration to merge our live brain onto the fixed brain. And I'm really interested in kind of pushing that forward and seeing how many different types of data of imaging data we can merge together to try and link some of these different temporal and spatial domains. So using the tradeoffs of different types of microscopy in live tissue versus say fixed tissue where we can zoom in a lot more and look at, you know, single molecule gene expression and so forth. And so I'm I'm interested to see what what sorts of um imaging modalities we can apply to look at these other levels of organization in the brain and and what sorts of uh registration approaches would be best to merge very different types of data.

So this is a multimodality imaging system not only allow us to visualize the metabolic activities such as those small metabolites like glucose, amino acids or fatty acids, we can directly visualize them because the isotope we add onto those small metabolites will form the new chemical bond, which is uh for example carbon deuterium bond, so we don't need to do click chemistry to add the bulky fluorescence probe anymore. So this layer of metabolic information uh can be visualized at the same time we want to see for example the calcium fluorescence signal in the same region of interest. So this uh combined imaging platform can be used to solve some biological questions such as neurovascular coupling system. Uh for example we we are so interested in how neuron talk to those other type of cells such as endothelial cells on the vasculature system like the the uh blood brain barrier for example. So uh another layer of information that we couldn't really uh image because of the technical limitation is how the endothelial cell from the vasculature system signaling back to the the neuron and uh how these like feedback uh feedbacks the circuits that work. So uh if we combine both the Raman based imaging with the multiphoton fluorescence imaging together then we can visualize both layers of information at the same time specially and temporarily for in vivo imaging.

So that's that's a different story. And typically you're imaging them if you if you need to do temporal imaging, you need to image them at around 100 hertz to get reliable, you know, wave forms. And so we do that with DIC. So DIC microscopy with just a camera is the best way to track the ciliary wave form. Um, but then if you want to track trafficking within this bending whip like wave form, that's where you need to do fluorescence. And so what the field has done is that they've either taken cilia that are beating and immobilized them pharmacologically so that they're not beating and then track protein trafficking within them, but that's such a major perturbation that, you know, we still don't know what protein trafficking within a beating cilium looks like because of that. So one thing, yeah, I don't know, you know, now you can do the combined DIC fluorescence, you know, that's not a challenging technique, but getting enough signal is then that becomes the challenge. So getting enough signal from what could be one to five proteins and part of like a particle train, um, to get enough signal from that to reliably track it within the wave form would seem to be what would be needed.

But you keep every time you do that you split the light, so you're really going to need transmitted light measurements, right where your photon, your excitation photons are doing the work, not your emission photons.

And Melika talked about spatially, uh maybe lower resolution imaging and then you find something interesting and zoom in do uh super resolution that really high resolution imaging. I found that that shared theme very interesting. Um, do we want to um as a group talk a little bit about that what are the challenges um and and um there's a little bit of a right? uh AI guided uh automatic zooming in uh that's already been done what what's people uh experience?

But often the if you measure say 100 cells and you perturb them and then you measure them at similar time points, you actually get very repeatable behavior often for certain gene networks. So it turns out you can actually link the snapshot data using some modeling ideas. So these come more from control theory, so they're things like chemical master equation and these other things. What's really interesting about them is you can actually predict if you take enough data what the cells might do under a new stimuli or you can predict which time points you should then measure to reduce your uncertainty. So you can do sort of a coarser set of experiments and then predict like where do I need to fill in to understand the dynamics in my system better. And we actually showed that you can do this well enough where you can extract say um elongation rates of RNA from these snapshot data. So then we went back into the line system and actually measured the elongation rate and actually showed we got it right from the computational inference. The the problem we run into there again is we just started with an overwhelming amount of data. So we're stuck to this idea of like, can we it's really easy to start from this overwhelming data, specify a model and say I should have measured here. I think it gets much harder to start from a sort of first principles modeling and say this is where I need to be doing my measurements to learn the most over space and time and that problem I think is is still really challenging and I don't have a good handle on the best way to approach it.

Uh and also the uh I think the uh user guided imaging where where you uh you focus where with a with a bigger field and then you zoom in on a smaller field. That's exactly what I would looking for.
