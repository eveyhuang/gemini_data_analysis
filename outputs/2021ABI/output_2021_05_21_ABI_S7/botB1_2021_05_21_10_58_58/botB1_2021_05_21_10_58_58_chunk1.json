Hopefully let me know if you cannot access it and I will adjust the permissions. Um and so that way people can follow along and they can actually add as well, but um we can use that and then uh summarize at the end and copy it in.",

Hopefully you've interacted with some of you, but we'll we'll do kind of a brief intro and I would appreciate if your introduction um has some sort of direction towards this particular topic. So what you're interested in related to the imaging across temporal and spatial domains.",

So um I also have worked on spect uh and uh quite extensively spect and one thing like sorry like gun to the head I the only thing I can remember that is uh you can do simultaneously um multiple modalities. So um so for example, interferometry is giving you attenuation and uh phase and uh scatter images completely different three physical uh properties simultaneously because you're able to capture the phase shift and scatter and you can do it with uh different radio tracers for um multi tracers for pet um pet imaging for example, you know, at different energies um for the same detector and um so that's that's what comes to my head quickly and uh if somebody thinks it's useful. I lack the biological part so if somebody gives me a problem I can think about it. Thank you.",

            "transcript": "Hi, my name's Domenico (Nick) Galati. I'm at Western Washington University. I'm in the biology department there. And uh the reason I think I was probably put in this group is because I I'm very interested in protein trafficking within small structures known as cilia and cilia are diffraction limited and they're really important for a lot of developmental clinical things so they they receive Sonic Hedgehog signaling and so that's really important for patterning. And what's interesting is that the cilia generally in terms of human mutations, they're not they're not abolished so they're still present but there's just minor defects in trafficking within the cilia and to the cilia. And so this has only been studied so far for the most part, the hardcore trafficking stuff has only been studied in static cells that aren't moving or in cilia that aren't moving but in a developing organism clearly they are moving. And so something that the field needs is to be able to study cilia trafficking in either a cilia that's beating because sometimes they beat back and forth to generate flow. Um that's really challenging because they can beat up to 15 to 20 hertz. So trying to image a diffraction limited spot and something that's beating at 20 hertz uh would be a challenge and so that's the kind of stuff that I'm interested in. I have the biological expertise and I can do, you know, I do fluorescence imaging and and live cell imaging and super resolution imaging and stuff like that. But um I think that that problem will need something beyond that. So thanks.",

            "transcript": "Hi everyone, my name is Arnold Hayer. I'm a faculty in the Department of Biology in McGill University. And uh my lab is primarily interested in signal transduction that regulates cell motility. So migration of million cells and uh not only of single cells but also of collectives of groups of cells. So the the main challenge related to the topic of this breakout session um in the context of my research is I think to link molecular events to subcellular events and to super cellular events. So so it's kind of the we need to understand what's happening at the molecular level um what is happening with for example polymerizing acting structures um but they happen at a very very fast time scale and uh cells move at a much much slower cells time scale. So uh the the big challenge then is to to link uh these molecular events to the larger um cellular outcomes. And um I don't quite know how to do that because you know if we if we monitor on single molecules we we can probably do that. Um but how do we know that which molecular signal event would then translate into a cell for example to polarize as a whole which happens on the scale of tens of minutes. So that would be something to to think about. And regarding this this um other question of uh how can we collect simultaneously at different times of resolution I I guess um one could think of of um imaging live cell imaging streams where you resolve where you try to monitor events at a relatively low resolution and then have online um automated image analysis that ident identifies relevant events zooms in goes at really high uh imaging frequency so um this is something that we don't do but but that we that I thought could be something of interest of course the technical challenges to overcome and and developing a robust workflow for for doing this.

Um my lab um um uses and develops single molecule uh methods and uh in particular super resolution imaging to study spatial and temporal organization of cells. Um one question of interest in the lab is genome folding genome organization um and how that uh regulates gene activity. Um and when we when we study uh genome organization again this is as as Nick said it's a diffraction um sort of limited imaging cannot visualize how the DNA is folded in uh 3D space inside the nucleus. Um nucleus is very crowded um uh chromatin DNA uh folding happens at small length scales. Um so to uh visualize this we need very high resolution um methods like super resolution microscopy. Uh but these super resolution microscopy methods are often uh very slow. Um and so we also are interested in dynamics of the nucleus and to study that we have to do it separately. Um so um for example label subsets of um um uh chromatin interacting proteins or chromatin components and and track their dynamics at fast time scales. Um and somehow sort of relate those two things together in in in separate experiments. And so um you know there's always uh in in microscopy I think trade off between spatial and temporal resolution um and um I don't know if it's possible to you know either optimize that trade off or or get rid of it completely. That would be um quite uh uh an an important challenge I think um to tackle.",
