            "transcript": "Okay, so I think we're ready to get started. Um, so I wanted to thank everyone for joining. I know it's a busy time of year, um, but I really appreciate you taking the time to meet with us. Um, so as you know, we're working on this, um, ideas lab proposal, and the goal of this meeting is to really kind of brainstorm some novel ideas that we can put into this proposal. Um, so I thought I would just kind of start by giving a little bit of background on the proposal itself, um, and then we can kind of go around and everyone can introduce themselves and talk a little bit about their expertise and what they're interested in contributing to the proposal. And then we can just kind of open it up for discussion and see what ideas we can come up with. Um, so the proposal is focused on, um, developing new technologies for sensing in plants. Um, so it's really kind of a broad topic, um, but the goal is to really kind of think about what are the big challenges in plant sensing and what are some new technologies that we can develop to address those challenges. Um, so the proposal is due in November, so we have a little bit of time, um, but we really want to get started on this now so that we can have a really strong proposal. Um, so I think that's kind of the overview. Um, so maybe we can just start by going around and everyone can introduce themselves and talk a little bit about their expertise and what they're interested in contributing to the proposal.",
