Uh, so recently there are starting to have efforts uh to shift to longer wavelengths so that not only the excitation is in the infrared region, but also the emission is also in.

That's of course not great because the probes are also bleaching. So kind of would much rather quantify an increase in fluorescence. Some of them are based off of GFP, other are based off of other kinds of proteins and their modalities under development for a really nice multiphoton excitation, but also single photon uh has been quite you know, broadly uh used. Voltage sensor imaging is super important for neuroscience because despite the dominance of really heavily engineered GFP based calcium sensors, we know that calcium reporting of neural activity is really limited. Uh, it's got really slow temporal kinetics, which helped us at first because we didn't have a good imaging methods to go faster. Uh, but it's slow, you know, it misses neuronal action potentials, it doesn't report hyperpolarization very well unless on a really slow time scale. Uh, it doesn't tell you very much about, you know, not nothing about some threshold events, which is you know, everything about how neurons compute is about sub threshold very interesting biophysics and integration across the, you know, unique and neuron type specific uh dendritic trees that they used to collect information with. Um and so yeah, genetic continued development of genetic probes is really important and the visible spectrum is is pretty full currently because a lot of people are also combining sensors and effector uh proteins such as the different kinds of opsins.

Sorry. But I think um there's I think a a huge growth area although um clinical translation becomes a little less obvious or a little bit larger barrier is developing contrast agents, right? And so not just agents which have different chromophore properties but maybe are responsive in some way, you know, or triggerable um rather than um, you know, so sort of distinguishing between different reactions rather than relying on um multi wavelength from multi chromophore kind of approach to distinguish between contrast agents or probes.

        "utterance": "Barbara Smith, ASU: Yeah, so we do it's electrophysiology. So, um, the micropipet electrode, um, was developed, I think, in this realm in the 1960s and um, they record neuronal activity. It's high resolution recording of typically single neurons, um, and their activity level, um, with the with the um, it basically, I won't go into detail. Um, so the electrode is placed into the brain and um, it's typically done either um blind or um using optical microscopy approaches from from external sources. So, uh, a microscope on the outside. And and so what ends up happening is if you had um, if you work with this blind, you would use like probably a DIC microscope and um, you can do this in in vivo and the electrode is placed in and uh positive pressure is is pushed into the electrode as it's moved through the brain tissue so that that electrode doesn't get clogged. The tip of the electrode is about um one to three microns in diameter and that electrode is is moved little very, very, very slowly into the brain, um, and there's no way to target selective cells of interest using the blind approach, but you can get deeper, right? So, um, the only way the most basic way that they know that they've hit a cell of interest is by creating a connection between that electrode and that cell. So they place it from a positive pressure and then we make a negative pressure from that. We create a bleb, so it sucks up part of that membrane of the cell. Um, we um increase the pressure and it opens up the cell membrane so that there's a direct connection between that electrode and the fluids within the electrode and the cell um solution. And and what ends up happening is the um, it ends up being able to record that cell, but you don't know what cell you're hitting until you start recording it. And if you've started recording the wrong cell, you have to remove that micropipet electrode, um, throw it out, place a new one in and then enter into the brain one more time. And so, uh, it's kind of a hunt and peck process. You can get deeper and people can record very well, uh, neuroscientists have been recording like that for for decades. Um, but lately with two photon microscopy, you can get down to about a millimeter and you can genetically alter or place in different kinds of dyes and and selectively target neurons up to a millimeter. But past the millimeter from the cortical surface, um, there are minimal ways to do it. So you can suction out a portion of the brain. Um, that's one way to do it. And then the animal is still alive and you can move down, um, and you can do within a millimeter of whatever area you've sectioned. Um, or if you're coming from the top, you can see cells about within a millimeter of of where that surface is. If you're exceptional, if you're doing three photon or multiphoton, you can get maybe two millimeters. Um, it's a little bit rough. Um, but the way that we're doing this is, oh, oh, uh, is we're integrating light and sound into that micropipet electrode, so you don't need a microscope on the outside to guide that cell. And so, um, we can get uh stains and genetic um genetic contrast throughout the brain and now we can we can tap into cells, um, of interest at at depths beyond one millimeter as deep as that. So we're combining um blind and an imaging guided approach by doing this, but without the microscope on the outside. Hope that made sense. ",
