You could stand up there and report back that elephants are the best way to do imaging. I bet you no one actually catches you on this, but anyway, if if I just go to the prompt that we had, um maybe as a as to kick this out, um maybe start out with optical ideas, which I think is the central to all of that and then let you guys take it. But the first one there is, are there methods beyond confocal and light sheet to address 3D regions deep within a tissue sample.",

Uh and so there might be a need to develop that technology much much further on on the optical side to push that to biologist because they needed to be turn key. So I I kind of agree with Genia that uh that uh it still looks very promising. There are enormous efforts waiting to be done. And then beyond that, I feel like um um another aspect is uh single shot 3D imaging, like computational imaging, uh light field microscopy or uh just any depth dependent PSF with matter surface, with the new materials where you can project depth dependent PSFs across the volume.",

But like I think like basically it's going to be there's going to be other ways to I think improve your ability to get those photon to create the excitation and to harvest photons. And um I think there's more opportunity because it's not it's not just reconstructing the PSF where you just have enough of a power density, you're also the pulse duration is becomes very important as well. Um and so I think, you know, ways to sort of solve all those issues or to get around them or to, you know, find new methods, I think is really where the opportunity will lie.",
