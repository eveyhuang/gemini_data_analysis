One is, you know, throw more photons at it and get deeper. Um two is if you are in a light sheet type uh context then, you know, do some uh holography for shaping of beams uh or use some penetrative probes uh which for many pre-clinical applications are possible and there it begins to be more about optimizing those so that you get the most amount of information for the least amount of um tissue damage.",

So for me deep tissue imaging means I'm looking at a piece of tissue excised from somewhere deep in an organism. However, over the last several years I was working on a project at the NCI called the imaging data commons where we had to think about collecting images related to cancer from a whole bunch of modalities. You know, initially this means radiology because those are most of the images that have been collected. We started and thinking or the group that's still working at is thinking now about other modalities like deep tissue imaging, you know. So how do you bring them all together, make them interoperable and interoperable enough to where you can then infer knowledge by asking a question about one type of data and pulling relevant information from other types of data like deep tissue.",
