I'm wondering for photoacoustic imaging, you know, I hear a lot about detecting hemoglobin and I assume that's because it's very concentrated and has sort of spectral properties that are that are easy to detect using the photoacoustic imaging. What other kinds of molecules can you detect and um, yeah, what is the kind of specificity?",

So if a molecule is not as good at emitting, it takes in a certain wavelength and it's very good for photoacoustics at that point because then that heat is a that energy is absorbed, it gets excited and then it can produce a photoacoustic response more than a fluorescent response. So you can use a molecule that's not very good um at a at being fluorescent, you can still use it for fluorescence but it's not so good um but you can also generate a photoacoustic effect from it.",

So melanin absorbs, everything absorbs. So it's a big challenge to actually figure out where your signal is uh if your signal is coming from where you want it to be. And and that's where targeted contrast agents they really help. So everything, like every part of our body is talking all the time. So whenever you're exposed to light, they are generating tiny bit of acoustic signal. So it's almost like talking.",

It's uh training is still a very important. I mean, eventually I suppose robotics can take this over.

There are challenges about it is that uh how to preserve the images on the way in and on the way out. So, so that is um that is uh the challenge that could be potentially solved by again light shaping because the the scattering from the fiber can uh be determined. I thought what is interesting from the discussion from Barbara and Carolyn is that um the combination of ultrasound and optics, I totally agree even if we spend all this money, all these efforts on optics, we probably will still be stuck at millimeter level, right? So uh the photons are going to be lost. They're going to be back scattered.",
