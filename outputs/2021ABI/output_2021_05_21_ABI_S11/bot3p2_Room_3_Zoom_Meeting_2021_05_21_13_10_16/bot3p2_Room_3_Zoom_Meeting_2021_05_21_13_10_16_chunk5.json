I mean, I was just thinking, you know, as everybody was talking, um something like you can think of plants are as super regenerators, right? Like a a bamboo plant for instance, if you ever have bamboo in your yard and you're trying to get rid of it, it's not going to happen. Like that plan is going to grow back. You can chop it down, you can cut off the roots, it will grow back. So it would be really cool to to look at a tissue like that that's really thick, um if you could get, you know, a centimeter or two into that tissue and and look at the, you know, the regeneration processes. I think that would be really cool application of of this kind of technology that uh has not been to my knowledge done at all before.",

This this scope or integrated. You so um let me try to read it out I suppose. What integrative techniques allow wide field screening of tissue to identify region of interest which can be subsequently imaged at very high magnifications perhaps super resolution. So in some sense that's been talked about maybe in other sessions but um I suppose in the context of deep tissue imaging is is um I don't know exactly how you would do that.

Or maybe even one that, you know, could allow you to do single molecule or whatever, you know, whatever else you want to do. Um that seems like it could be like a cool way to that.

That that is already really good. Um in that region wave front shaping means um so um when you are looking through the fog, you cannot see what's behind the fog, right? So that is because scattering. So the light travels in. So even if you have perfectly aligned colmated light, it scatters everywhere. So wave front shaping tries to compensate for scattering. So it kind of predicts how the light scatters uh from all these heterogeneous particles and then it kind of uh sends in this pre-aberrated light, which means it already have these uh uh compensation. We call it phase conjugation. Basically the opposite effects of the scattering that's happening in the tissue so that when this light travels through this fog or scattering tissue, uh in theory they are supposed to be canceled out and uh so what you eventually get is that it's uh it's you you use this wave front engineering to turn this opaque tissue into transparent, optically transparent tissue.
