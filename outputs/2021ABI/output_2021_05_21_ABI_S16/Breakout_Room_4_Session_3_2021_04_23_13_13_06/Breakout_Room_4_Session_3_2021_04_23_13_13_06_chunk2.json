So we look at real time monitoring basically and we also are working on variable um diagnostics, wearable sensors that they can monitor the physiology of the let's say human uh like temperature, heart rate, uh and environment like temperature of the environment and things like that. So we are interested to really see how environment and the um the human in terms of the neurotransmitters and the microbiome uh they are correlated uh using our sensors that we can contribute. Nice to meet you all.",

And my lab studies the effects of the the physical environment on the gut microbiota from the perspective of uh measuring how both the microbes can modify the environment themselves by producing metabolites, changing the osmolality as well as changing uh properties like the pH, but also is modulated uh by the environment uh because certain species will not be able to uh to grow at the same rate uh depending on how these physical factors are changed. And we find that these physical factors are really important uh in understanding uh diseases such as uh inflammatory bowel disease in which uh not only is there a strong inflammatory response, but there's also very important local changes such as uh oxidative stress, uh local changes in temperature if there's inflammation, uh changes in pH uh and malabsorption.",
