Um, and I think the points that have been made now by Chris and Carolina and others about like the need for genetic tools are very good. Um, in the absence of those, we might have to think about more global interventions, um, with small molecules or things. Again, it depends on the type of stress and it's taking kind of a sledgehammer approach because it's not a very precise mechanism, but if you're thinking about pH stress or oxidative stress, are there small molecule modulators, um, you know, I previously worked with vibrio cholera a lot and for a lot of those animal models, the way you get them to work is to dose the rabbit with an antacid to enable a relaxation of the bottleneck of the stomach so you get reliable colonization of the intestine.
