I do and many people complain saying that I'm just creating a stress to the host or the micro by changing the circadian. Yes, that is the biological uh uh stress. For the stress to me is change in homeostatic environment of the organism. Um and I like the idea of one of you said that the uh stress in one species can result in the stress in the others although environment may not be stressful for one species and could be with other and interactions. Okay. when you are discussing it, you have to just actually be clear in our mind, what do we mean with the stress.

Um which is all its own kind of question, like how do you define which which stress is the most important on a microbe?

Um, and I think the points that have been made now by Chris and Carolina and others about like the need for genetic tools are very good. Um, in the absence of those, we might have to think about more global interventions, um, with small molecules or things. Again, it depends on the type of stress and it's taking kind of a sledgehammer approach because it's not a very precise mechanism, but if you're thinking about pH stress or oxidative stress, are there small molecule modulators, um, you know, I previously worked with vibrio cholera a lot and for a lot of those animal models, the way you get them to work is to dose the rabbit with an antacid to enable a relaxation of the bottleneck of the stomach so you get reliable colonization of the intestine. So are there things like that that can address major bottlenecks in the host that affect microbial growth and colonization. It's just an idea.",

And then we talked about host stress like in PTSD, um Alzheimer disease or others. Then we talked about engineering in um genetics, for example, non model species maybe or organite type models, mass models and combining the physiologically relevant and reductionist approach. Um, it's important, I think Lisa mentioned it's important to make sure we are mimicking the environment properly. Um, so then we can study uh different factors in a reliable way. And uh the second question was the signals can be disrupted or intercepted as needed. How can? Can they be? So somewhere in bioengineering for probiotics. Um, I don't remember who mentioned that. Uh, I assume it's like related to synthetic biology maybe. Um, okay, what do you think? Suggestions? What did I miss?",
