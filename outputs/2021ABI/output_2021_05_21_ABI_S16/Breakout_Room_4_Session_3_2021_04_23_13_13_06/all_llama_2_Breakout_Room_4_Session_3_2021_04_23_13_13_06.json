I do and many people complain saying that I'm just creating a stress to the host or the micro by changing the circadian. Yes, that is the biological uh uh stress. For the stress to me is change in homeostatic environment of the organism. Um and I like the idea of one of you said that the uh stress in one species can result in the stress in the others although environment may not be stressful for one species and could be with other and interactions. Okay. when you are discussing it, you have to just actually be clear in our mind, what do we mean with the stress.

Um might be one way to start to get a handle on this because I guess from what I'm what I'm gathering from the conversation is there are just so many different types of stress, so many different types of stress response that we're thinking about that we need to kind of start to define, okay, which ones do we want to look at, how do we look at them? Um which is all its own kind of question, like how do you define which which stress is the most important on a microbe?

Oxidative stress is one of them, I guess this is one of common stressors to many things.

But I I I thought it's stress is really depends on the model we're studying, you know, if we're studying and the neurodegenerative disease and what the stress will be and uh in for the GI uh the GI disease and what the what the stress we should actually study or focus.

I host microbiome like interactions and system levels. I think this one although seems um can be actually understood in a like reductive models because you would just want to look at how each microbiome like each bacteria respond to different kind of stress. Um there must be a kind of sensor proteins in the bacteria and that can sense the stress and then has a like inter cellular signal pathway. Oftentimes is a activation of transcription factors. So I feel these actually can be studied um in individual that in a really simple model model case. Of course um in I guess in the gut there's still much more complications. However, I think even in a lab space already we can draw so much more understanding about um how they respond to each stress.",

But that is one model that you can experimentally take advantage and also see how you can disrupt it. How about the other models to look at the the host related uh uh stress example PTSD.

But um also one limitation with those other than other environmental factors is you may not sample all cell types, like it can be depending on how you in our case, depending on how you grow them and differentiate them, you may not get like the parietal cells that are the acid secreting acid secreting cells that are relevant for like pH stress. Um, and I think the points that have been made now by Chris and Carolina and others about like the need for genetic tools are very good. Um, in the absence of those, we might have to think about more global interventions, um, with small molecules or things. Again, it depends on the type of stress and it's taking kind of a sledgehammer approach because it's not a very precise mechanism, but if you're thinking about pH stress or oxidative stress, are there small molecule modulators, um, you know, I previously worked with vibrio cholera a lot and for a lot of those animal models, the way you get them to work is to dose the rabbit with an antacid to enable a relaxation of the bottleneck of the stomach so you get reliable colonization of the intestine. So are there things like that that can address major bottlenecks in the host that affect microbial growth and colonization. It's just an idea.",

Um, so first thing was um like anything that can causes the um dysbiosis, right? Um, under microbiome pH osmotic nutrient, um oxygen level. Host immune response. And then we talked about host stress like in PTSD, um Alzheimer disease or others. Then we talked about engineering in um genetics, for example, non model species maybe or organite type models, mass models and combining the physiologically relevant and reductionist approach. Um, it's important, I think Lisa mentioned it's important to make sure we are mimicking the environment properly. Um, so then we can study uh different factors in a reliable way. And uh the second question was the signals can be disrupted or intercepted as needed. How can? Can they be? So somewhere in bioengineering for probiotics. Um, I don't remember who mentioned that. Uh, I assume it's like related to synthetic biology maybe. Um, okay, what do you think? Suggestions? What did I miss?",

I know some groups are working on that.

So it's same way we have different species of bacteria with different genus. So what works in E doesn't work in. Second is a lot of the traditional method rely on homologous combination and the selection is antibiotic resistance. So we just don't know what sort of antibiotic resistance profiles certain bacteria have once we have to grow them in the lab to do all of that and then we have to figure out which plasma can go in and which plasma can integrate and things like that. So those are the challenges. I this just needs more effort, more volume of effort. Like the initial E methods were developed using phages actually by and other people. Um and so, you know, people just need to be more motivated to do it.",
