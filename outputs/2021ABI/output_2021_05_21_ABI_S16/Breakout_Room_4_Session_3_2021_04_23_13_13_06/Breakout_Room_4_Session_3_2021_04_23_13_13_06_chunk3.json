Uh first of all, you know, microbiome uh we we we can you make it broader, it's not just bacteria, right? There are others that are also involved. Uh so I think um actually this was one of the topics of our previous group, the the one that I was in uh talking about uh you know, there is inter species interaction, virus, uh fungus, bacteria and you know, others um and how they are affecting each other. So I think some of those they can be uh nutri nutrition for one species but like a stress or the byproduct of that metabolism, it could be a stress factor for another uh species.

Uh and for that discussion, we may consider the uh host derived stress and the other one would be the microbial stress. Right? Obviously lack of oxygen is a stress proof for aerobic bacteria whereas the presence of oxygen is a stressful for anaerobic and the pH and uh and in a gut for example, the movement of the gut I was intrigued that as a gastroenterology, fact please that the neuro scientist talking about the bubble movement um in in a host. the the kind of things that obviously I have to do it on a daily basis for the uh motility of the gut can be stressed um in um uh in the micro. I do and many people complain saying that I'm just creating a stress to the host or the micro by changing the circadian. Yes, that is the biological uh uh stress. For the stress to me is change in homeostatic environment of the organism. Um and I like the idea of one of you said that the uh stress in one species can result in the stress in the others although environment may not be stressful for one species and could be with other and interactions. Okay. when you are discussing it, you have to just actually be clear in our mind, what do we mean with the stress. Now what do you think the impact of a stress whatever you're going to define it is on micro and micro signaling and micro host interactions. Anyone.",
