Obviously lack of oxygen is a stress proof for aerobic bacteria whereas the presence of oxygen is a stressful for anaerobic and the pH and uh and in a gut for example, the movement of the gut I was intrigued that as a gastroenterology, fact please that the neuro scientist talking about the bubble movement um in in a host. the the kind of things that obviously I have to do it on a daily basis for the uh motility of the gut can be stressed um in um uh in the micro. I do and many people complain saying that I'm just creating a stress to the host or the micro by changing the circadian. Yes, that is the biological uh uh stress. For the stress to me is change in homeostatic environment of the organism. Um and I like the idea of one of you said that the uh stress in one species can result in the stress in the others although environment may not be stressful for one species and could be with other and interactions. Okay. when you are discussing it, you have to just actually be clear in our mind, what do we mean with the stress. Now what do you think the impact of a stress whatever you're going to define it is on micro and micro signaling and micro host interactions. Anyone.",

So trying to think about what what ways we can use to study, I guess in a more high throughput way what the impact of different conditions on these different taxa are. Um might be one way to start to get a handle on this because I guess from what I'm what I'm gathering from the conversation is there are just so many different types of stress, so many different types of stress response that we're thinking about that we need to kind of start to define, okay, which ones do we want to look at, how do we look at them? Um which is all its own kind of question, like how do you define which which stress is the most important on a microbe? Oxidative stress seems like a reasonable place to start just based on leaky gut and what we know about oxidative stress and um metabolism, but I guess that's what I'm trying to run through that.",

Um, and I think the points that have been made now by Chris and Carolina and others about like the need for genetic tools are very good. Um, in the absence of those, we might have to think about more global interventions, um, with small molecules or things. Again, it depends on the type of stress and it's taking kind of a sledgehammer approach because it's not a very precise mechanism, but if you're thinking about pH stress or oxidative stress, are there small molecule modulators, um, you know, I previously worked with vibrio cholera a lot and for a lot of those animal models, the way you get them to work is to dose the rabbit with an antacid to enable a relaxation of the bottleneck of the stomach so you get reliable colonization of the intestine. So are there things like that that can address major bottlenecks in the host that affect microbial growth and colonization. It's just an idea.",

And then we talked about host stress like in PTSD, um Alzheimer disease or others. Then we talked about engineering in um genetics, for example, non model species maybe or organite type models, mass models and combining the physiologically relevant and reductionist approach. Um, it's important, I think Lisa mentioned it's important to make sure we are mimicking the environment properly. Um, so then we can study uh different factors in a reliable way. And uh the second question was the signals can be disrupted or intercepted as needed. How can? Can they be? So somewhere in bioengineering for probiotics. Um, I don't remember who mentioned that.

Second is a lot of the traditional method rely on homologous combination and the selection is antibiotic resistance. So we just don't know what sort of antibiotic resistance profiles certain bacteria have once we have to grow them in the lab to do all of that and then we have to figure out which plasma can go in and which plasma can integrate and things like that. So those are the challenges. I this just needs more effort, more volume of effort. Like the initial E methods were developed using phages actually by and other people.
