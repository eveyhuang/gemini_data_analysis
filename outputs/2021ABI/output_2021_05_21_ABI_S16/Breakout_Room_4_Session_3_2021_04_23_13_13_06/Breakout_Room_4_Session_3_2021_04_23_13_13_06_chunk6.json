            "transcript": "Yeah, I'll just add to that also that we we also do work with organoids but with gastroids, uh, you know, generated from human mouse gastric tissue. But um also one limitation with those other than other environmental factors is you may not sample all cell types, like it can be depending on how you in our case, depending on how you grow them and differentiate them, you may not get like the parietal cells that are the acid secreting acid secreting cells that are relevant for like pH stress. Um, and I think the points that have been made now by Chris and Carolina and others about like the need for genetic tools are very good. Um, in the absence of those, we might have to think about more global interventions, um, with small molecules or things. Again, it depends on the type of stress and it's taking kind of a sledgehammer approach because it's not a very precise mechanism, but if you're thinking about pH stress or oxidative stress, are there small molecule modulators, um, you know, I previously worked with vibrio cholera a lot and for a lot of those animal models, the way you get them to work is to dose the rabbit with an antacid to enable a relaxation of the bottleneck of the stomach so you get reliable colonization of the intestine. So are there things like that that can address major bottlenecks in the host that affect microbial growth and colonization. It's just an idea.",

Um, so first thing was um like anything that can causes the um dysbiosis, right? Um, under microbiome pH osmotic nutrient, um oxygen level. Host immune response. And then we talked about host stress like in PTSD, um Alzheimer disease or others. Then we talked about engineering in um genetics, for example, non model species maybe or organite type models, mass models and combining the physiologically relevant and reductionist approach. Um, it's important, I think Lisa mentioned it's important to make sure we are mimicking the environment properly. Um, so then we can study uh different factors in a reliable way. And uh the second question was the signals can be disrupted or intercepted as needed. How can? Can they be? So somewhere in bioengineering for probiotics. Um, I don't remember who mentioned that. Uh, I assume it's like related to synthetic biology maybe. Um, okay, what do you think? Suggestions? What did I miss?",

So, um, you know, when the um host is under stress, like when we are under stress, so we know a lot of biochemicals in our um like in our saliva, for example, uh it is changing and we can measure them. Like, you know, when our cortisol level is changing, our um um hormones like I don't know, epinephrin is changing. Um, so and those have effect in in terms of um changing how uh microbes they proliferate, right? So there is really a connection, but I don't know if we really mention them anywhere. They are a stress response of the host, right? And they can modulate bacteria or perhaps other microbes as well.",
