      "transcript": "So I think the idea is that we can use the existing data to do some kind of like a prediction or classification, right? So, for example, we have the data from the healthy control and the patient, and then we can use this data to train a model to classify or predict whether this new data is from the healthy control or from the patient. And then we can also use the data from the patient to predict what kind of patient it is, like a classification. So, I think that's the idea. And then we can also use the data from the healthy control to predict what kind of healthy control it is, like a classification. So, I think that's the idea. And then we can also use the data from the patient to predict what kind of patient it is, like a classification. So, I think that's the idea. And then we can also use the data from the healthy control to predict what kind of healthy control it is, like a classification. So, I think that's the idea. And then we can also use the data from the patient to predict what kind of patient it is, like a classification. So, I think that's the idea. And then we can also use the data from the healthy control to predict what kind of healthy control it is, like a classification. So, I think that's the idea.
