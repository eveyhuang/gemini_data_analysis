We can we can definitely see the different difference between the proteins, we can definitely see the protein database between the two species and we pick up if we pick up the one model, uh we we we we did the bioinformatic analysis. We saw a lot of metabolism, amino acid disruption and the the regulation and uh ferroptosis and the uh in the autophagy related cell death and the endocytosis related uh the signaling pathway they all change uh in the AD in the context of the AD versus white type animals. And I think now we just focus on one of this pathways to manipulate. definitely we need to pick up the good protein, the good candidate to manipulate those uh the signal pathway.",

There are lots of other things and the genetic modulation that because if you can increase the resiliency of a stress response, you can have a much easier to disrupt the signaling and vice versa. I can't remember I've uh how many more do we have I think we've got more 15 more minutes because I want to make sure we have 10 minutes to uh uh summarize things. what I hear from you guys that in fact I like what said that that question make it much easier compared to other uh question we we had in the last two days to become reductionist to answer. if especially if there is a stress signaling in response to microbial stress that you can be a very reductionist one. But that is one model that you can experimentally take advantage and also see how you can disrupt it. How about the other models to look at the the host related uh uh stress example PTSD. We know the PTSD cause microbial changes. What do you think? So how do you decide which model you are going to use anyone?",

Um so you know, in terms of I I guess the thing that I have been thinking about though, which is again not not host related but um is I know that there are actually big changes in um in gene expression between different sorry, my cat is like having a moment. Um different uh kind of expression in in different states of bacteria. So for example, the bacteria that you culture in lab that might be um, you know, planktonic or swimming will have a different genetic signature than one that would be grown as a biofilm in lab. And so one of the things I guess that I've been thinking about is how would you sort of interface that with one of these organoid models. Um and I I don't know the answer, but I think that could be something that would be really interesting to think about.",

The microbiologist in since the last, you know, 50, 60 years or even more 70 years have mostly focused on developing genetic tools for proteobacteria like E coli salmonella and others. And bacterities uh people didn't really think a lot about. There were like few labs Abigail Salier and few others who were making mutations in bacterities.",
