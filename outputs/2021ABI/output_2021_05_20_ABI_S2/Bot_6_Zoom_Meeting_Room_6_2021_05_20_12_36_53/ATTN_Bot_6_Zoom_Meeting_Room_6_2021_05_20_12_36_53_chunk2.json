Um, so this particular session, all it ends up has to be is one one slide in a slide deck, but it's within this group that maybe a couple of individuals identify complementary skills or we're trying to identify maybe the bigger questions that some people may want to pursue. So it's sort of free form, but I'm giving you a sense of where it all ends up. So the report out is to say we'll just be a simple slide, we're not going to write a paper or anything from this session. And uh, but it but it it is important for us to get a a bit of input from everybody.",

I don't know whether it would be whether it's fret, whether it's something else. I think that would be technically it would be tracking in vitro because you'd be looking at the path or in or in vivo.

The emit um I don't know if you guys are familiar with it, but it's it's amazing. It's uh basically you just flash freeze a mouse. Um you'd have to have some sort of signal in it. It'll do I mean you can you basically turn an entire mouse into 20 micrometer sections. And so what it'll do is it's this giant knife that comes across and shaves off these cryo sections of this mouse.

Um you'd have to have some sort of signal in it. It'll do I mean you can you basically you turn an entire mouse into 20 micrometer sections. And so what it'll do is it's this giant knife that comes across and shaves off these cryo sections of this mouse. And then it'll it'll image and then reconstruct the entire whatever you imaged into a three-dimensional it's like an Ivis but with way, way better resolution than an Ivis. So",
