How do you get I think Brian we talked earlier about signal to noise being basically the problem of all of us you know in this in this entire you know log is that we're all looking for how to get the best signal to noise and you know pet's going to have the potential for being very high contrast imaging or a lot of signal and so my group does pet reporter gene development in that goal of doing gene and cell therapy imaging.",

But it has always seemed to me that micro CT while in clinic you can't really get you know the level of resolution that you can now in animals but I mean the radiation doses you get on some of these small animal images are so small now that you can get very high resolution and still image in the live animal. And so I've always wondered sort of why um you know people haven't sort of focused on um you know contrast like instead of contrast injectable contrast dies but contrast lipids or whatever that would be labeling single cells or that would be I don't know we we talked about actually like injecting iron or like soaking the cells in iron and then trying to chase them around in in our CT one time but of course I didn't have the bandwidth to do that.",
