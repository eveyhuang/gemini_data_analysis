            "transcript": "So in um so in optical imaging so my field is optical imaging we uh so we our field specializes in uh imaging resolution um and so we are actually very uh like imaging like cells and even subcellular features are very well within our capabilities. Um but in terms of um but in terms of answering the question about how can we see cells as they migrate through actual organisms the reason that gets difficult is our pain point is imaging through scattering tissue which is whenever you get into bigger biology that's what we struggle with. Like MRI CT pet they we're a lot more um limited by that than the other modalities are. That said uh there is there are a few hybrid approaches are coming in. And so at least for small organisms like um you know like zebrafish or maybe uh even a mouse brain where you like take off the skull and you put like a transmission window through it. In these types of uh specific scenarios there are systems where uh you kind of get pseudo optical resolution but with a lot greater uh penetration depth into the scattering tissue. Um and so I wonder if there's a way to track cells at least in that first millimeter or so depth into the scattering tissue and that might be really important for specific applications where maybe the cell you care about isn't going to go through the whole organism it's only is going to be localized to like the surface areas of the brain or of the spinal cord or whatever. Um and so some technology that I'm really excited about in this space uh like are like of course you have the normal very uh popular optical technologies like confocal and light sheet and stuff like that.",

And one of the benefits of this is that it's a label free. Um so it's basically the contrast it's well it doesn't have to be label free but it was initially presented as label free where the contrast is coming from um absorption. So of course you can introduce exogenous particles that are absorptive to give higher contrast to specific specific components.",
