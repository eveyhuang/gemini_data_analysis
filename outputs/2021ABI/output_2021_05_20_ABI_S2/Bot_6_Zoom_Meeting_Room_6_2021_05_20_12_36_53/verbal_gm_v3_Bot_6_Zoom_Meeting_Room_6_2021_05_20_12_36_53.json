Like MRI CT pet they we're a lot more um limited by that than the other modalities are. That said uh there is there are a few hybrid approaches are coming in. And so at least for small organisms like um you know like zebrafish or maybe uh even a mouse brain where you like take off the skull and you put like a transmission window through it. In these types of uh specific scenarios there are systems where uh you kind of get pseudo optical resolution but with a lot greater uh penetration depth into the scattering tissue.
