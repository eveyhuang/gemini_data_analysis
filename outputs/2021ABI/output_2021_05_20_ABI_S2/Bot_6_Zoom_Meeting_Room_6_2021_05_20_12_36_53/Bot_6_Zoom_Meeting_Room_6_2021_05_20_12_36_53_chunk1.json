So um, you know, fluorescent quantum dots that emit anywhere from the UV through the visible near infrared and um moving into the sphere now um for both um fluorescence imaging as well as fluorescence biosensing. So we're really excited moving forward um looking at taking some of our fret based fluorescent biosensors and uh developing them for swear imaging for in vivo use um and uh uh one of our we're trying to make some translational materials also. So starting with biocompatible and biodegradable semiconductor nanocrystals and then developing their optical properties rather than starting with things first made for solar cells and uh LED lights, maybe make them for a biological approach and then develop the optical things. So um those don't always fluoresce, so we're accidentally making some photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy um particles on accident as it happens. Thanks.",

And uh the research program that we are pursuing is uh interested in understanding the signaling networks that govern cell migration and we are using cultured endothelial cells as a model system and we're interested in both the signaling dynamics in individual cells um but also how these signaling dynamics in individual cells are coordinated between neighboring cells during collective cell migration. And uh we have a a two-dimensional model for collective cell migration which is basically just monolayers and cells are moving within the monolayers but also three-dimensional migration and and morphogenesis, which is something endothelial cells do. So a lot of our work relies on fluorescence imaging using um probes, reporters for cytoskeletal structures or for um for fret based fret based probes for activities such as ro GTPases. So we're tracking cells but in in in single cells we're also tracking um regions of cells like protrusions, retractions and trying to relate those morphogenetic processes to signaling activities.",

So we have some um synthetic chemistry efforts in the lab. Um, I'd say the the areas that we're the most focus on right now are imaging of infectious diseases. So one is how do you monitor bacteria trafficking around an animal or a human. So we do pet reporter um pet probe approaches for that. And then the second area that's kind of germaine to this topic is really the imaging and control of gene and cell therapies. And so if you look at, you know, the next breakthrough or pillar of medical therapies, it's probably going to come through these engineered systems where viruses and cells have been made to treat people's diseases and how do we get assessments of those um those therapies in situ.",
