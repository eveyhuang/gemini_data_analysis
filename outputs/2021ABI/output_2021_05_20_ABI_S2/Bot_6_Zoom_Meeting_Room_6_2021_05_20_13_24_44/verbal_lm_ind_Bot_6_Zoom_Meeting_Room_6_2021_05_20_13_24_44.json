I have idea um because of this uh COVID-19 uh vaccine, uh we had we had work on the SRI uh SRA um conjugation to the nanoparticles to uh silence the harmful genes for the cells related to apoptosis or related to the new rejection. Um I was fascinated uh to read the papers and I I also I got the vaccine uh to to know uh the the nanoparticle can deliver the RNA to to your immune cells. So um I mean if we can um work on some like imaging to see the um how this RNA uh works because because um because um before this uh COVID-19 before this uh vaccine uh it's hard for me to understand how you can deliver um like RNA to the cells and the cells going to translate to the protein and this protein can can be recognized by um immune cells.

There's, yeah, there are things like FDG that measures your metabolism, but you're looking at the body's own metabolism, um, and up regulated in immune cells. So there's a group down at Johns Hopkins, um, Sanjay Jane's group has been working on this and they've got some, um, labeled sorbitol for pet imaging, which is kind of cool because we don't take, we don't use sorbitol as a carbon source, but bugs do. Um, we're using an antibiotic, uh, trimethoprim to image bacteria themselves. Other people are using D amino acids. So there's a whole, you know, like chemistry world that's out there trying to develop probes specific for your question, um, you know, Brad about how to image pathology, um, using these probe development approaches.
