So there's a group down at Johns Hopkins, um, Sanjay Jane's group has been working on this and they've got some, um, labeled sorbitol for pet imaging, which is kind of cool because we don't take, we don't use sorbitol as a carbon source, but bugs do. Um, we're using an antibiotic, uh, trimethoprim to image bacteria themselves. Other people are using D amino acids. So there's a whole, you know, like chemistry world that's out there trying to develop probes specific for your question, um, you know, Brad about how to image pathology, um, using these probe development approaches.",
