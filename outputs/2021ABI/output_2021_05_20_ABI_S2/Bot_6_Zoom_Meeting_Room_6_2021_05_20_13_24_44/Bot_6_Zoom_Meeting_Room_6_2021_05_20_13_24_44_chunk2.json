One was that you would have to label exogenous cells and then you introduce them and then you track them and so then the question becomes what's the best label and you've just talked of a couple and then the that that paradigm changes to one where you're now presumably adding a contrast agent that's going to go and find a certain cell population and then stick to it or maybe longitudinally lay, you know, keep redosing all the time. There seem to be two general strategies. Each have their own particular technical challenges.",

That's one one um one thing um um I mean, probably we should also uh pay some attention on the uh theranostic like protect the cells or control the cells function after you put the cells in for the transplantation. Um I don't know. I have idea um because of this uh COVID-19 uh vaccine, uh we had we had work on the SRI uh SRA um conjugation to the nanoparticles to uh silence the harmful genes for the cells related to apoptosis or related to the new rejection. Um I was fascinated uh to read the papers and I I also I got the vaccine uh to to know uh the the nanoparticle can deliver the RNA to to your immune cells. So um I mean if we can um work on some like imaging to see the um how this RNA uh works because because um because um before this uh COVID-19 before this uh vaccine uh it's hard for me to understand how you can deliver um like RNA to the cells and the cells going to translate to the protein and this protein can can be recognized by um immune cells.",
