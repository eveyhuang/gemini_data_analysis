And so there are model systems in which you can do it, but then as you try and say scale the field of view up or scale the 3D information up, I just have a really hard time seeing with the current way that things are going, how that's going to happen really well, right? And so one place people have been trying is to do label free methods and then infer what molecules were there. So there's all these sort of ideas and so I don't know, I think it's going to take a big shift in the way that we approach these to try and get something out of it.",
