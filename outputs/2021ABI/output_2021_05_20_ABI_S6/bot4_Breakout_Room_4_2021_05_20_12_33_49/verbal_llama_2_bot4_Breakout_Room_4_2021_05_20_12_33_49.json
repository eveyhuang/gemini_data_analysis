And if uh if a larger project can be built around built with that utility where people can start designing their own hypothesis driven research around that shared resource. I think that's where the that's where the real power is. That's where things take off. And that's also where Allen fails is that there's a lot of partial data sets in some of the most interesting points and you just get to it and you don't quite know how to interact with it. As as a personal note, I think another thing that that makes one of these larger projects work or not work is can you drop a graduate student into it with a couple tutorials? Like if you have to be steeped in that large scale project in order to access it and and interact with it in any way, it doesn't work. You have to have here's how you get the basic data out.

So we just we're storing everything on our own, which is not really a feasible path forward because no one can really look at it except the people part of the network we're in.

So, you know, I still to me there's there's different time scales, right? So if we want to like we want to the promises about activity, but we can think about any molecular level activity that's transient.

But um when I I'm thinking about this questions like the football game analogy, right? If you have a single picture of the football game, who knows what you are going to be able to understand about that football game. It depends entirely on what is happening in that picture. And if you can learn anything, maybe you just see a bunch of men on a pile on a field, right? And you have no idea why they're there. But the more pictures you have, the more um you know, far away, the close-ups, the receiver in midair grabbing the ball, the more of those kind of images you have, um the better kind of hypothesis you can form and then you can actually do your experiments to test, you know, but that but that's the crucial part is doing the experiments.

Basically when you take a tissue from the patient and you put it in a mouse and grow in the mouse and then you treat the mouse with drugs and see how the tumor responds to that treatment. So you can just put it back in the patient then, the treatment that is. And one of the conclusions uh there was one talk that actually shocked me. So uh they did a study where they took this tissue out of the patient and put it in the Petri dish just to preserve for some time, which was not that long and then transplanted in a mouse. And then they uh did an analysis of this tissue and they saw that during this time the tissue was sitting in the Petri dish, there was a significant change in gene expression in I I don't remember the exact number but something like 40 different genes changed their expression. Um so my question is, so by looking at the, you know, football game and stuff, so this is not even the football game. This is I would say much worse because you're looking at something that happened post uh extracting this tissue. So if you want to look at the real thing, how do you even go back to the real thing?

Someone sent us an arabidopsis with the microtuble labeled to look at the streaming of them and it's a lens. Like the cell wall is a lens. So we have this very high resolution light sheet system, which is similar to this lattice thing everybody's heard about but a different idea. And it just moves the beam and moves the light. And so actually traditional fluorescence methods are not really amenable to like fast 3D imaging in it without a ton of work. And this was really amusing actually because it the guy basically who sent it to us, it was a random collaboration. He's like this isn't going to work but I'm curious to see what you see. And like I was surprised how bad it was. I mean you could actually see the beam like bend completely as it goes through it. So I mean I think there's lots of things like this across fields that can be learned from. Like if we could solve that problem it potentially helps solve scattering issues in other tissues, right? So this has actually got us thinking a lot about how to deal with that. And so it was really valuable for us to see this from somebody else's perspective of like, oh yeah, that's right. Like there are other things than cell culture, right? That we can just are pretty transparent in all for all intents and purposes. ",
