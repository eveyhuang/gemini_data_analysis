I think there's enough individual to individual variability where some of the explanation that can bridge those different levels uh would be best served if it can be across the same individual.",

Um and then mapping the chemistry across it. Um but you can to a certain extent, it depends on the time, but if you have enough samples, if you have enough replicates, you can look at time and how that changes. So for example, we're looking at root regeneration, you cut off the tip of the root, you can measure um regeneration occurs over a couple days. So, you know, you take as many samples as you can, you cut them up and and you can image them. And if you could do something like that with the brain, with the with the transcriptomics, with the electron microscopy, I mean that would be a really powerful way um in the same section to get a lot of information potentially over time.",

So I've started taking all of my data and so I collect whole brain data and now I register all of that into the Allen Brain common coordinate framework, whether I need to or not. And it's changed the way that I look at my data instead of seeing how individuals change and then trying to do statistics and put them together, I start thinking about, well, how do I build models out of the data as it is. And if it doesn't, if it doesn't work, then I need to collect the data in a different way to get it to fit into a larger model of some biological process. And it's this mixture of registering of registering data sets versus trying to use that registered data to build a model that can be applied to a stereotypical version of the thing. So that's something I've been struggling with, when do you register and when is it just data you collect to get replicates.",

And so we have this this it seems like a conflict of saying, do we want a huge amount of subjects or do we want a really deep dive into one subject or five subjects and to understand that variability and what it means. And and I think, you know, very different labs go in very different directions and then we end up viewing things with a very different lens that can eventually be hard to reconcile. Um but I I think there must be a way that we're we're trying to get at the same things, but we're just going about it really focusing on that that subtle constant variation of what happens within a network you identify and what happens in that network you identify when you look at it once in a many different subjects. Um and it's something I yeah, I'm still wrapping my head around. I know which side I do, but I don't know how you sort of engage with the other lens.",

And actually this has turned out to meet a lot of headlong resistance across different groups of, oh, well, we just need all of it. But this is not a tenable thing and quite often people don't use the data. So from our sense, we're really trying to understand like if you really want to answer, I don't know, how network A functions and you have some idea of how it's connected, can you come up with some sort of sort of framework which tells you something, right? And you can pick different metrics like fish information or something to then ask like, you know, along what ways am I most variable that I should fill this out to reduce the uncertainty in how it's acting. And I think there's a big lack of that in designing big imaging experiments at the moment where it's just let's just take a lot of data. Uh and again, this is from the molecular and kind of cellular point of view. I don't deal with people. So I'm sure there's different things in designing experiments with people, but this is my point of view.",
