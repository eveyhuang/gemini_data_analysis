            "transcript": "Hey everyone, welcome to the meeting. I'm really excited to talk about some of the ideas that we've been floating around for the last couple of weeks. I think there's a lot of really interesting potential here. So I wanted to start by just kind of going around and having everyone introduce themselves, say a little bit about their background, and then maybe one or two sentences about what they're hoping to get out of this collaboration. So I'll start with myself. I'm David Van Valen, I'm a professor at Caltech. I'm interested in using machine learning to understand biological systems, and I'm hoping that this collaboration will lead to some new insights into how we can use these tools to solve real world problems. So with that, I'll pass it off to Dylan.",
