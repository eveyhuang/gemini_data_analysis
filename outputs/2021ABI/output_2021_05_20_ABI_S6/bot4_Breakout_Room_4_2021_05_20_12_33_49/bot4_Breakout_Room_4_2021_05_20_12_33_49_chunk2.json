Um so I think the other thing that they suggested which I think makes sense is in the first minute here is to take a look at that slide with the sort of um the prompts and and then um think about how you might want to respond to that and then we'll we'll start opening the discussion from there.",

I know, you know, we just already talked about some of the organisms that people are working with. Um some more simple than others and where individual cells can already be tracked, but what do people see as some of the major hurdles and and major challenges that we have to overcome with imaging to be able to get to sort of the next level.",

Um you know, so you could imagine, you know, MRI down to fluorescence down to cryo um cryoEM.

He wants to do cryoEM of an entire human brain even though it's going to take 10,000 years. And the question becomes well what does that what does um cryoEM level resolution give you when we're talking about macro scale connections and is that are some elements of that data not important and vice versa, like do do macro scale issues really affect um you know submicron scale um cellular connections. So some of it you you have to get rid of because you can't handle all that complexity and so what are the things you get what are the things you keep and what do you throw away as you switch between scales.",

And we generate spatial omics data and it's like 40 terabytes and no one ever does anything with it. And then my question always is like this if you want to learn something about how the the network is functioning, then you need temporal data. So it's great to take all these, you know, huge maps and make these maps, but you know, I think there's a huge hole missing on the bigger, better, more resolution, which is like is it really that helpful to have that map if you don't know anything about what's going on inside of, you know, the network or doing these things. And so I I think for me I see a pathway to scale a lot of the imaging methods to to bigger samples, what I don't see is a a way to scale measuring things over time in the bigger samples at the moment where you have the resolution you need. I think that's a much bigger challenge personally for us at the moment.",
