And so the the data that we currently have are and and that's kind of what we've been discussing that that there've been experiments that have taken place that are not necessarily translatable to all the different labs and all the different information that we're looking for. And so I think maybe it kind of takes a a left turn here and and the question is in terms of um small activity and molecular mechanisms and and contrast with that.",

It cannot be to answer all the experimental questions we have. I mean, we have to do experiments based on whatever we find. But um when I I'm thinking about this questions like the football game analogy, right? If you have a single picture of the football game, who knows what you are going to be able to understand about that football game. It depends entirely on what is happening in that picture. And if you can learn anything, maybe you just see a bunch of men on a pile on a field, right? And you have no idea why they're there. But the more pictures you have, the more um you know, far away, the close-ups, the receiver in midair grabbing the ball, the more of those kind of images you have, um the better kind of hypothesis you can form and then you can actually do your experiments to test, you know, but that but that's the crucial part is doing the experiments.",

            "transcript": "If I may add um one thought to this. So I was uh the meeting uh in New Orleans uh some years ago on a PDX models. Uh for those of you who don't work with that, it's a patient derived xenografts. Basically when you take a tissue from the patient and you put it in a mouse and grow in the mouse and then you treat the mouse with drugs and see how the tumor responds to that treatment. So you can just put it back in the patient then, the treatment that is. And one of the conclusions uh there was one talk that actually shocked me. So uh they did a study where they took this tissue out of the patient and put it in the Petri dish just to preserve for some time, which was not that long and then transplanted in a mouse. And then they uh did an analysis of this tissue and they saw that during this time the tissue was sitting in the Petri dish, there was a significant change in gene expression in I I don't remember the exact number but something like 40 different genes changed their expression. Um so my question is, so by looking at the, you know, football game and stuff, so this is not even the football game. This is I would say much worse because you're looking at something that happened post uh extracting this tissue. So if you want to look at the real thing, how do you even go back to the real thing? How do you even know what the real thing is? Um, I'm still thinking about it.",

This is totally the way it is. Then you go in vivo and it's not there at all. So you're right that there's this other element which is there's some data that's actually not applicable because it's you're not looking at a football game, you're looking in the locker room, you're looking on the tour bus, you're looking somewhere else and it's not not the system you wanted, it's the system that lives in a dish.",

One was how do we integrate information across scales? And so a lot of a lot of these conversations kind of went around the details of that. Uh what is registration? Um how does how does one identify signatures to sort of move to I guess it should be modalities and scales. Um and then what's the value of a longitudinal individual data set versus um statistical replicates versus um registered groups. And then uh within that even if a if a network can behave differently across experiments then how does how do you handle that complexity? So those are the three main groups. I think I can collapse it into more than that and and I'm pasting I'm just going to dump all those onto the slide and maybe we can edit them down here in a second.",
