And we generate spatial omics data and it's like 40 terabytes and no one ever does anything with it. And then my question always is like this if you want to learn something about how the the network is functioning, then you need temporal data. So it's great to take all these, you know, huge maps and make these maps, but you know, I think there's a huge hole missing on the bigger, better, more resolution, which is like is it really that helpful to have that map if you don't know anything about what's going on inside of, you know, the network or doing these things. And so I I think for me I see a pathway to scale a lot of the imaging methods to to bigger samples, what I don't see is a a way to scale measuring things over time in the bigger samples at the moment where you have the resolution you need. I think that's a much bigger challenge personally for us at the moment.",

And actually this has turned out to meet a lot of headlong resistance across different groups of, oh, well, we just need all of it. But this is not a tenable thing and quite often people don't use the data. So from our sense, we're really trying to understand like if you really want to answer, I don't know, how network A functions and you have some idea of how it's connected, can you come up with some sort of sort of framework which tells you something, right? And you can pick different metrics like fish information or something to then ask like, you know, along what ways am I most variable that I should fill this out to reduce the uncertainty in how it's acting. And I think there's a big lack of that in designing big imaging experiments at the moment where it's just let's just take a lot of data. Uh and again, this is from the molecular and kind of cellular point of view. I don't deal with people. So I'm sure there's different things in designing experiments with people, but this is my point of view.",

So I think like what what hasn't been talked about is how yet um is how these collections for, you know, creating for creating like these integrated um, you know, multimodal understandings of, you know, different biological systems, is also the same data and associated labels that are going to create the algorithms that are going to be required to interpret like said data.

But at this point Allen Brain has been around long enough where I know to structure my experiments around those particular like time points. It's like I'm interested in those developmental stages because I have access to that data. And I think that's also the the power of certain model organisms where it's like you know the genome is there, you know all these tools are already laid out. And if uh if a larger project can be built around built with that utility where people can start designing their own hypothesis driven research around that shared resource. I think that's where the that's where the real power is. That's where things take off. And that's also where Allen fails is that there's a lot of partial data sets in some of the most interesting points and you just get to it and you don't quite know how to interact with it. As as a personal note, I think another thing that that makes one of these larger projects work or not work is can you drop a graduate student into it with a couple tutorials? Like if you have to be steeped in that large scale project in order to access it and and interact with it in any way, it doesn't work. You have to have here's how you get the basic data out. Here's some tutorial things. You have to be able to leave somebody with, you know, reasonable amount of training, but who are novices. They have to be able to make progress on on those data sets in order for them to have value to the larger community.",

And I would say that a very strong amount of effort has been put into the the omix side of it of integrating metadata across these things and doing that. I would say so far this is just a personal opinion is that the imaging side is a is a mess because everyone's not annotating metadata and there's no place to upload the data actually. So we just we're storing everything on our own, which is not really a feasible path forward because no one can really look at it except the people part of the network we're in. But even if we do generate all that reference data set, which is what you know, the goal is, it's still very difficult to know how to leverage that to to come back to this time issue. So, you know, I still to me there's there's different time scales, right? So if we want to like we want to the promises about activity, but we can think about any molecular level activity that's transient. That's lost in all the experiments that we've been kind of talking about here, right? In terms of a lot of what we're talking about. And so I I still see that as like a really big challenge of",

Um some of in some cells you see that the trafficking is okay, others you see that it's disturbed. And then you did endpoint multiplex uh fish. Um and you might find that the ones that had disturbed trafficking had, you know, this gene expression signature while these other ones didn't. You could imagine taking that signature and then going back into the um cell atlas data and seeing if you can find cells that have like that um that distinct signature.",

But um when I I'm thinking about this questions like the football game analogy, right? If you have a single picture of the football game, who knows what you are going to be able to understand about that football game. It depends entirely on what is happening in that picture. And if you can learn anything, maybe you just see a bunch of men on a pile on a field, right? And you have no idea why they're there. But the more pictures you have, the more um you know, far away, the close-ups, the receiver in midair grabbing the ball, the more of those kind of images you have, um the better kind of hypothesis you can form and then you can actually do your experiments to test, you know, but that but that's the crucial part is doing the experiments.",

Uh for those of you who don't work with that, it's a patient derived xenografts. Basically when you take a tissue from the patient and you put it in a mouse and grow in the mouse and then you treat the mouse with drugs and see how the tumor responds to that treatment. So you can just put it back in the patient then, the treatment that is. And one of the conclusions uh there was one talk that actually shocked me. So uh they did a study where they took this tissue out of the patient and put it in the Petri dish just to preserve for some time, which was not that long and then transplanted in a mouse. And then they uh did an analysis of this tissue and they saw that during this time the tissue was sitting in the Petri dish, there was a significant change in gene expression in I I don't remember the exact number but something like 40 different genes changed their expression. Um so my question is, so by looking at the, you know, football game and stuff, so this is not even the football game. This is I would say much worse because you're looking at something that happened post uh extracting this tissue. So if you want to look at the real thing, how do you even go back to the real thing? How do you even know what the real thing is? Um, I'm still thinking about it.",

Um how does how does one identify signatures to sort of move to I guess it should be modalities and scales. Um and then what's the value of a longitudinal individual data set versus um statistical replicates versus um registered groups. And then uh within that even if a if a network can behave differently across experiments then how does how do you handle that complexity? So those are the three main groups.

I think the technologies improved, data analysis has gotten better, data sets have gotten larger. Um but you know, that all has been integrated through that interface and all of us that work in that field find that super valuable where you you find some interesting gene or protein and you can go there and you can immediately see proteomics data, you can see transcriptomic data, you could even get any kind of um genetic information of who's done knockouts and it's more like a community that pulls it together but it is a huge effort but I mean it is something that makes me think from an imaging perspective if if people with all these different backgrounds and modalities and data sets could come together in an integrated way, um you know, I think there there's there's really a lot to be gained from that whether or not that could be done with images, I don't know.",

You know, I study plants. Um but if we're really interested in certain conserved mechanisms, there are other model systems that um have significant advantages for answering questions about dynamics or um how a specific kinase is working or something like that. I mean in the root for example, you can see time across the length of the root. So that's one reason we we work with it. The youngest cells are always at the tip of the root, the oldest cells are at the stem cell. So you can study aging, you can study development in that way. And 70% of our genes are conserved, right, with with a banana. So there are a number of of networks that can be studied in plants that actually have uh relevance for humans and that's just plants right there. many other organisms that, you know, if we can expand the types of organisms we can look into with all of these methods, I think we can address a lot of these challenges um experimentally.",

Like the cell wall is a lens. So we have this very high resolution light sheet system, which is similar to this lattice thing everybody's heard about but a different idea. And it just moves the beam and moves the light. And so actually traditional fluorescence methods are not really amenable to like fast 3D imaging in it without a ton of work. And this was really amusing actually because it the guy basically who sent it to us, it was a random collaboration. He's like this isn't going to work but I'm curious to see what you see. And like I was surprised how bad it was. I mean you could actually see the beam like bend completely as it goes through it. So I mean I think there's lots of things like this across fields that can be learned from. Like if we could solve that problem it potentially helps solve scattering issues in other tissues, right? So this has actually got us thinking a lot about how to deal with that. And so it was really valuable for us to see this from somebody else's perspective of like, oh yeah, that's right. Like there are other things than cell culture, right? That we can just are pretty transparent in all for all intents and purposes.",
