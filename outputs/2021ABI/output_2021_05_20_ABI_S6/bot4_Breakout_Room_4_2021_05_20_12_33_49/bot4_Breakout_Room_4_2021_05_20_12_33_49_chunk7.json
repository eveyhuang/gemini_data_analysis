And I mean I guess I'd be interested in hearing from people that work on bigger things, like how do you get more resolution or what would you need from us to to make it work better for you.",

I mean just from experience with the um in some of the parasite systems we work with in particular malaria and toxoplasma, they created these these databases that are toxoDB and plasmoDB which were created by a group at Penn and it's been interesting to watch that over the last decade as it's built up. I think the technologies improved, data analysis has gotten better, data sets have gotten larger. Um but you know, that all has been integrated through that interface and all of us that work in that field find that super valuable where you you find some interesting gene or protein and you can go there and you can immediately see proteomics data, you can see transcriptomic data, you could even get any kind of um genetic information of who's done knockouts and it's more like a community that pulls it together but it is a huge effort but I mean it is something that makes me think from an imaging perspective if if people with all these different backgrounds and modalities and data sets could come together in an integrated way, um you know, I think there there's there's really a lot to be gained from that whether or not that could be done with images, I don't know.",

You know, I study plants. Um but if we're really interested in certain conserved mechanisms, there are other model systems that um have significant advantages for answering questions about dynamics or um how a specific kinase is working or something like that. I mean in the root for example, you can see time across the length of the root. So that's one reason we we work with it. The youngest cells are always at the tip of the root, the oldest cells are at the stem cell. So you can study aging, you can study development in that way. And 70% of our genes are conserved, right, with with a banana. So there are a number of of networks that can be studied in plants that actually have uh relevance for humans and that's just plants right there. many other organisms that, you know, if we can expand the types of organisms we can look into with all of these methods, I think we can address a lot of these challenges um experimentally.",

Um, you know, I'm at I'm at one end and I I do not know how to think about manipulating a 14 year old person the same way as an 80 year old person, must much less the same way as a mouse or the same way as a banana. So I I think that I I agree that I want to use imaging in the context of testing hypotheses and putting together imaging at different scales would be a key aspect of that, but my I my conceptual limit is understanding how we could kick the tires in a similar enough way to really learn from that hypothesis testing across species, etc.",

Like the cell wall is a lens. So we have this very high resolution light sheet system, which is similar to this lattice thing everybody's heard about but a different idea. And it just moves the beam and moves the light. And so actually traditional fluorescence methods are not really amenable to like fast 3D imaging in it without a ton of work. And this was really amusing actually because it the guy basically who sent it to us, it was a random collaboration. He's like this isn't going to work but I'm curious to see what you see. And like I was surprised how bad it was. I mean you could actually see the beam like bend completely as it goes through it. So I mean I think there's lots of things like this across fields that can be learned from. Like if we could solve that problem it potentially helps solve scattering issues in other tissues, right? So this has actually got us thinking a lot about how to deal with that. And so it was really valuable for us to see this from somebody else's perspective of like, oh yeah, that's right. Like there are other things than cell culture, right? That we can just are pretty transparent in all for all intents and purposes.",
