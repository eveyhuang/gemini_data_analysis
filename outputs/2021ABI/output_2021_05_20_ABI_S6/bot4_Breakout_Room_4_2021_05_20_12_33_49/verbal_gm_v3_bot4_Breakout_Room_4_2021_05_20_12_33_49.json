Basically when you take a tissue from the patient and you put it in a mouse and grow in the mouse and then you treat the mouse with drugs and see how the tumor responds to that treatment. So you can just put it back in the patient then, the treatment that is. And one of the conclusions uh there was one talk that actually shocked me. So uh they did a study where they took this tissue out of the patient and put it in the Petri dish just to preserve for some time, which was not that long and then transplanted in a mouse. And then they uh did an analysis of this tissue and they saw that during this time the tissue was sitting in the Petri dish, there was a significant change in gene expression in I I don't remember the exact number but something like 40 different genes changed their expression. Um so my question is, so by looking at the, you know, football game and stuff, so this is not even the football game. This is I would say much worse because you're looking at something that happened post uh extracting this tissue. So if you want to look at the real thing, how do you even go back to the real thing?

I mean just from experience with the um in some of the parasite systems we work with in particular malaria and toxoplasma, they created these these databases that are toxoDB and plasmoDB which were created by a group at Penn and it's been interesting to watch that over the last decade as it's built up. I think the technologies improved, data analysis has gotten better, data sets have gotten larger. Um but you know, that all has been integrated through that interface and all of us that work in that field find that super valuable where you you find some interesting gene or protein and you can go there and you can immediately see proteomics data, you can see transcriptomic data, you could even get any kind of um genetic information of who's done knockouts and it's more like a community that pulls it together but it is a huge effort but I mean it is something that makes me think from an imaging perspective if if people with all these different backgrounds and modalities and data sets could come together in an integrated way, um you know, I think there there's there's really a lot to be gained from that whether or not that could be done with images, I don't know.
