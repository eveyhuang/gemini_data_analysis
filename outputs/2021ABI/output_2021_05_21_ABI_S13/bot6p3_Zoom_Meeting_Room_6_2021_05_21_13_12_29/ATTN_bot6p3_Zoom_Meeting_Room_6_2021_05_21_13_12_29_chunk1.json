Um I am really interested I chose this session because in development we have a lot of images. So we take high resolution um across time and space these beautiful images, but I think in my field at least we don't do enough to quantify the and actually get all of the data we can out of these images and I thought that um it would be really great to figure out how to take these, you know, Z stacks, these confocal whatever you're you're using and figure out better ways to actually define, you know, cell tension, protein interaction, um and and and pull as much out of that as possible.",

I am interested in how the heart grows and since I'm a cell biologist, I focus on cells because that's kind of what we do. And so I'm interested in how cells both proliferate in the heart and also enlarge. Uh and to do that we use a variety of optical uh so light based uh microscopes all the way from very low mag imaging for screening purposes uh like 10 or 20x objectives low mag uh up to super resolution and now for better or for worse we're doing expansion microscopy plus super resolution. Um and that's pretty much what we're doing. Uh and the whole goal is to see basically how a heart muscle cell grows actually enlarges and then survives different conditions that uh would necessarily kill a human if it would happen in vivo.",
