I was going to actually just address something Dylan Dylan mentioned and Ferdinand mentioned earlier that does it matter whether or not there's lab reproducibility and the answer is when we start thinking about the session I was just in, which is transitioning animal models to then human therapies, yes it matters, right? So you have to be able to see the same thing across models, across cell types that you expect to see to be able to ultimately get to where most of us are interested in getting is curing human disease or human disorders. And so I think that it does matter that we have to address that and I agree that it starts even within a lab, within a system.",

And so literally same objective, two different numerical apertures has a uh you know, I'm sure super resolution is very susceptible to that.",

So how about having a neural network that transforms? So you have images from one side say and from another side, uh everything's the same, maybe different cell cultures but same idea, same data basically. Uh so now you have a neural network that converts the data from one side to to tries to predict how the data acquired at site A would look like at site B if it were acquired at site B. And now you have uh it's basically what's it called? Is it a GAN? Uh it would be yeah it would be some kind like no it's not again, but you you have a discriminator, right? So you have a discriminator that now decides if uh something is a real image or not. So you basically uh train a neural network that can do this transformation between the two sides. And if at some point it works perfectly, you have a network that can transform the data really to the same type of artifacts and and same types of things and if it doesn't work perfectly, then you know that the information is just not there. So it's just not comparable data.",

I was thinking the same thing where the we assume it's true that the biological specimen is the same. Like but like Mimi was saying, maybe this group slices a little bit differently, this group doesn't, this group uses a green dye, this group uses a red dye and and we assume though that they are the underlying truth, they are the same. And then we know point spread functions, we know we can we can map those pretty reliably and if we use point spread functions to make sure that we can then align those two and we can make them equivalent using something like a point spread function or something like that. I was a very similar idea where we have to assume that with all the variabilities that that are are true between these two groups, they're both mice, it's both the same section, the same region anatomical region and and yeah, I'm intrigued by that idea. I don't know how it works.",

Uh but then there are also I mean it's possible with neural networks to have a discriminator that can really uh tell very well if uh an image that it sees is from a certain population of images.
