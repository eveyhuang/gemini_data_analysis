Personally, I don't care much about that because I think if if you publish something and you study something and you find something uh and someone cannot reproduce it, you still found something. I mean it's a problem certainly that another lab cannot reproduce it, but I mean truth is not generated by one publication anyways. I mean someone will shed different light from a different angle on the same problem and then uh knowledge is generated over time. For example, in my field uh with the imaging technique that we use, uh the literature is completely heterogeneous. Some people find something, some people don't find it, they find the opposite thing. Uh and that's also because of course the patient cohorts are different. Um but I think if if we uh do something with our technique and we reproducibly find the same thing in different groups, uh then it is some sort of evidence. If someone else finds something different in a different cohort with a different group, then we maybe have to think about um what does that tell us? What does it really mean? Is it due to the different technique or is something else different? In MRI field what's really a problem and just to shed a different angle here, um is the specificity of the quantitative imaging. So what are we even measuring there? Because if if someone talks about quantitative MRI, one thing I've learned in the past 15 years, it's not specific. If someone tells you you can do myelin imaging, it's not only myelin. Uh if someone tells you they're measuring iron, it's not only iron. It's always affected by other things. And uh a problem and even if you if you read the read the literature naively, of times it's very hard to understand because I think many people don't understand that their technique is limited and uh if they do, they don't want to put the finger on it because the reviewers might not like it. So for me it's more the people need to be educated about what the limits are of their own techniques and the question for me would be how do we solve the specificity issue? So how do we really get techniques that are that are measuring what we want to measure and are not affected by other things. For example, we try to measure iron, but all the techniques many techniques that measure iron are also affected by myelin. So if you have a demyelinating disease and myelin changes, uh what are you even measuring there? I mean what are we even doing as Crystal said, I mean does it even make sense? ",

And this idea is starting to get adopted by the more computational community as well where it's like here are all of the steps that we're going to do before we've ever even done any of it and so not only does it take out researcher degrees of freedom that idea of, you know, parameter scanning um to figure out what works, um but it also in theory improves reproducibility to the point where like literally anybody could else could do this and tell you your results before you've even done it yourself. Um of course the problem with that is incentive uh is is one of incentive where you you as an academic gets get no reward for doing this other than the thrill of having your work be reproducible. Um and so there has been an effort to try to there are some entities that will publish the results of your pre-registration regardless of the outcome assuming that the pre-registration passes peer review.
