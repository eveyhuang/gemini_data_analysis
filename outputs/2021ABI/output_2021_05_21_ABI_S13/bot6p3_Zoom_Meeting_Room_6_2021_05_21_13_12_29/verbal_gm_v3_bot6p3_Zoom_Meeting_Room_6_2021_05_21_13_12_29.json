Personally, I don't care much about that because I think if if you publish something and you study something and you find something uh and someone cannot reproduce it, you still found something. I mean it's a problem certainly that another lab cannot reproduce it, but I mean truth is not generated by one publication anyways. I mean someone will shed different light from a different angle on the same problem and then uh knowledge is generated over time. For example, in my field uh with the imaging technique that we use, uh the literature is completely heterogeneous. Some people find something, some people don't find it, they find the opposite thing. Uh and that's also because of course the patient cohorts are different. Um but I think if if we uh do something with our technique and we reproducibly find the same thing in different groups, uh then it is some sort of evidence. If someone else finds something different in a different cohort with a different group, then we maybe have to think about um what does that tell us? What does it really mean? Is it due to the different technique or is something else different? In MRI field what's really a problem and just to shed a different angle here, um is the specificity of the quantitative imaging. So what are we even measuring there? Because if if someone talks about quantitative MRI, one thing I've learned in the past 15 years, it's not specific. If someone tells you you can do myelin imaging, it's not only myelin. Uh if someone tells you they're measuring iron, it's not only iron. It's always affected by other things. And uh a problem and even if you if you read the read the literature naively, of times it's very hard to understand because I think many people don't understand that their technique is limited and uh if they do, they don't want to put the finger on it because the reviewers might not like it. So for me it's more the people need to be educated about what the limits are of their own techniques and the question for me would be how do we solve the specificity issue? So how do we really get techniques that are that are measuring what we want to measure and are not affected by other things. For example, we try to measure iron, but all the techniques many techniques that measure iron are also affected by myelin. So if you have a demyelinating disease and myelin changes, uh what are you even measuring there? I mean what are we even doing as Crystal said, I mean does it even make sense? ",

And this idea is starting to get adopted by the more computational community as well where it's like here are all of the steps that we're going to do before we've ever even done any of it and so not only does it take out researcher degrees of freedom that idea of, you know, parameter scanning um to figure out what works, um but it also in theory improves reproducibility to the point where like literally anybody could else could do this and tell you your results before you've even done it yourself. Um of course the problem with that is incentive uh is is one of incentive where you you as an academic gets get no reward for doing this other than the thrill of having your work be reproducible. Um and so there has been an effort to try to there are some entities that will publish the results of your pre-registration regardless of the outcome assuming that the pre-registration passes peer review. Um and that seems like that might be a pretty effective way at least on the computational end of helping out with reproducibility.

Uh so there are there are some limitations but even if you are doing a a low mag image of the same of of obvious structure like say mitochondria or the ER at different magnifications, you have to use different algorithms to quantify those. So not just switching from modalities but the actual magnifications of the same modality are not standardized even in the same lab. So if if if if we're switching to a new modality before we fix the the magnification problem in the same modality. I think Crystal really laid out well that if you have the exact same equipment, you should be able to reproduce the data. But none of us have the exact same equipment. And so that only applies if I have the exact same camera you have. And then you tell me exactly what you did and I could probably get close to reproducing it. But I bought the camera that was the cheapest that did the what I wanted it to do. So I don't know some of you probably have my cheap camera too, but most of you have better cameras um for for for imaging and so we have this magnification problem before before we switch modalities. magnification is key.
