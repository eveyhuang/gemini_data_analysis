You know, just having the human be the one that sets the threshold is to me this this this problem that I think is pervasive and like you said, you can give somebody the same image. So I I I I don't know the answer to it. I think it probably involves deep learning or something. But I think that, you know, and I had a discussion about this yesterday with somebody that's in the deep learning field and and their take is that ImageJ is now already obsolete and that all of this is going into the deep learning realm and people that like me that use ImageJ are going to get left behind. And I was sad to hear that, but I think it just seems like it's true.

And the end result of that is you're guiding the the the computer to make make decisions, but the end result is a standard that and and and we typically use this. We in our lab is like someone threshold holds her images and they give the other person the actual elastic parameters and they can threshold their images exactly the same way.

        "transcript": "I I have to admit I don't completely understand the discussion right now, but I see uh there was a point made that there's a limit of reproducibility in the literature. Personally, I don't care much about that because I think if if you publish something and you study something and you find something uh and someone cannot reproduce it, you still found something. I mean it's a problem certainly that another lab cannot reproduce it, but I mean truth is not generated by one publication anyways. I mean someone will shed different light from a different angle on the same problem and then uh knowledge is generated over time. For example, in my field uh with the imaging technique that we use, uh the literature is completely heterogeneous. Some people find something, some people don't find it, they find the opposite thing. Uh and that's also because of course the patient cohorts are different. Um but I think if if we uh do something with our technique and we reproducibly find the same thing in different groups, uh then it is some sort of evidence. If someone else finds something different in a different cohort with a different group, then we maybe have to think about um what does that tell us? What does it really mean? Is it due to the different technique or is something else different? In MRI field what's really a problem and just to shed a different angle here, um is the specificity of the quantitative imaging. So what are we even measuring there? Because if if someone talks about quantitative MRI, one thing I've learned in the past 15 years, it's not specific. If someone tells you you can do myelin imaging, it's not only myelin. Uh if someone tells you they're measuring iron, it's not only iron. It's always affected by other things. And uh a problem and even if you if you read the read the literature naively, of times it's very hard to understand because I think many people don't understand that their technique is limited and uh if they do, they don't want to put the finger on it because the reviewers might not like it. So for me it's more the people need to be educated about what the limits are of their own techniques and the question for me would be how do we solve the specificity issue? So how do we really get techniques that are that are measuring what we want to measure and are not affected by other things. For example, we try to measure iron, but all the techniques many techniques that measure iron are also affected by myelin. So if you have a demyelinating disease and myelin changes, uh what are you even measuring there? I mean what are we even doing as Crystal said, I mean does it even make sense?",

You know, is there a solution where you send your images in and you say this is the feature I'm interested in, you know, what data can be derived from those features. Um and then that way it sort of takes out sort of the the subjective sort of input into things. I'm just trying to think because there's been a lot of talk about activation energy and I I'd share that same issue where I think about deep learning and I have no idea where to start. And and so we can do some image analysis. We've repurposed uh tractography in a DTI based method for fluorescent intensity and so we can do tractography on fluorescent based images. So that's kind of one approach we've been able to take multimodality analysis and use it in different ways. But if you were to ask me to do deep learning, I would immediately go to somebody else and say, here are my images, what can you do with them? So how do we how do we sort of bridge that gap, reduce that activation energy while still trying to increase reproducibility.",

And this idea is starting to get adopted by the more computational community as well where it's like here are all of the steps that we're going to do before we've ever even done any of it and so not only does it take out researcher degrees of freedom that idea of, you know, parameter scanning um to figure out what works, um but it also in theory improves reproducibility to the point where like literally anybody could else could do this and tell you your results before you've even done it yourself. Um of course the problem with that is incentive uh is is one of incentive where you you as an academic gets get no reward for doing this other than the thrill of having your work be reproducible. Um and so there has been an effort to try to there are some entities that will publish the results of your pre-registration regardless of the outcome assuming that the pre-registration passes peer review. Um and that seems like that might be a pretty effective way at least on the computational end of helping out with reproducibility. Now once you get into things like deep learning models and you know, this kind of probabilistic training procedure, we are still kind of grasping for ideas because now you're talking about a model whose behavior is not entirely deterministic. Um and so simply pressing play um given, you know, a guy a series of steps is not by definition always going to give you the same result. Um and so that's kind of still an outstanding issue.",

But then there's the proliferation of like tweak plugins that take something that instead of funneling everybody through the same thing, then it starts proliferating laterally and that where that's where like I think a lot of the variability pops up.

I don't know. I'm sorry. Cell profiler, some other things. Um, and then you have the students manually doing it using image day or other methods and I think that first, it's really necessary to sort of every lab would have to normalize these data within the lab within the same sample before crossing modalities.

So if I'm looking at so this is actually something had had brought up is looking at um going from 2D to 3D, right?

Uh so there are there are some limitations but even if you are doing a a low mag image of the same of of obvious structure like say mitochondria or the ER at different magnifications, you have to use different algorithms to quantify those. So not just switching from modalities but the actual magnifications of the same modality are not standardized even in the same lab. So if if if if we're switching to a new modality before we fix the the magnification problem in the same modality. I think Crystal really laid out well that if you have the exact same equipment, you should be able to reproduce the data. But none of us have the exact same equipment. And so that only applies if I have the exact same camera you have. And then you tell me exactly what you did and I could probably get close to reproducing it. But I bought the camera that was the cheapest that did the what I wanted it to do.

So you have to be able to see the same thing across models, across cell types that you expect to see to be able to ultimately get to where most of us are interested in getting is curing human disease or human disorders. And so I think that it does matter that we have to address that and I agree that it starts even within a lab, within a system.",

So how about having a neural network that transforms? So you have images from one side say and from another side, uh everything's the same, maybe different cell cultures but same idea, same data basically. Uh so now you have a neural network that converts the data from one side to to tries to predict how the data acquired at site A would look like at site B if it were acquired at site B. And now you have uh it's basically what's it called? Is it a GAN? Uh it would be yeah it would be some kind like no it's not again, but you you have a discriminator, right? So you have a discriminator that now decides if uh something is a real image or not. So you basically uh train a neural network that can do this transformation between the two sides. And if at some point it works perfectly, you have a network that can transform the data really to the same type of artifacts and and same types of things and if it doesn't work perfectly, then you know that the information is just not there. So it's just not comparable data.",

And then we know point spread functions, we know we can we can map those pretty reliably and if we use point spread functions to make sure that we can then align those two and we can make them equivalent using something like a point spread function or something like that. I was a very similar idea where we have to assume that with all the variabilities that that are are true between these two groups, they're both mice, it's both the same section, the same region anatomical region and and yeah, I'm intrigued by that idea.
