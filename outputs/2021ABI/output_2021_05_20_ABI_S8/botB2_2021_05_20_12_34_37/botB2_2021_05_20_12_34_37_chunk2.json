Um, and and one of the things I can say that you really want to do is get to know each other's expertise through these discussions because because you know, um, that that's how little collaborations get started. I just love seeing people sitting there at little tables in uh in or in Tucson uh after a day and a half and I knew that one's a biologist, that one's a chemist, that one's a mathematician. Boy, that they they're they're going to have some fun. So, so that's a lot getting to to know each other is really important. So, and I will pass over to uh Lingyan, is that how you say?",

I was trained as a biomedical engineer uh for my bachelor, master and PhD. And also in the postdoc training I was working in uh when Dr. Way Ming's lab. And uh we were developing the uh SRS stimulated Raman scattering microscopy and we combined with the multiphoton fluorescence microscopy to visualize cellular metabolic activities. So um for my background, I think I combined the biological questions and also the um optical imaging technology together to um utilize this uh subcellular resolution imaging technique to visualize um the metabolic activities in cells and tissues or even live animals. So very nice to meet meet meet you meet you guys today.",

Um I'm a new assistant professor at UCSD. I started in November 2020 actually a pandemic year, so it's been exciting. Um my research is in nanophotonics. So I develop new nano optical material platforms and my hope is that um basically my research lab can leverage the complex manipulation of light that's enabled by these materials to probe the structural properties of biological matter both at the tissue scale or at the molecular scale. And kind of I think a a question that I'd like to ask the group uh related to this topic here label free imaging is can we maybe think beyond having markers and just use light as a marker in itself. So how can we structure light in complex ways um which is in some in many cases possible with nanophotonics uh to probe the the systems that we're interested in.",

So I feel very personally hurt and offended to be in a label free uh discussion because I love labels. They're amazing. So what we do is we make nanoparticle based sensors that we can put into in situ based measurement systems where we can look at spatial and temporal dynamics for analytes of interest in systems of interest where the analyte and the system are primarily what people are interested in funding. So work from DOE on energy stuff, NIH on health stuff, NSF on environmental stuff. But our core technology is all how can we make these nanoparticle based probes that we can put into biological systems and most of our questions revolve around the area of homogeneity and heterogeneity in these biological samples where life is not the same in all three dimensions. It's all over the place and chaotic and trying to measure that is one of the big challenges that we're trying to address.",

Uh my original training is applied uh optics and optical physics uh was developing components in optical fiber gratings and inverse problems. Then from there I moved to biophotonics and imaging during my post doctoral work. We worked on near infrared optical imaging, some x-ray imaging and in my lab currently we are looking at techniques where we can enhance the contrast in soft tissue at depth without having intrinsic contrast if possible, but we also look at contrast enhanced imaging. Some of the work is in looking at uh maximum information from every detected photon using single photon counting detectors and using it for phase contrast x-ray imaging, understanding how phase variations in x-ray can generate additional contrast without uh contrast agents and how do you then model this light propagation and and retrieve the information back uh to get additional information which you can otherwise not get for example in current mammography and other. So one big goal would be uh label free enhancing contrast early stage detection of cancers. Uh so yes Kevin uh Kevin just mentioned working with contrast agent. We are also looking at contrast agents for these advanced techniques. Uh while that is not the ultimate goal, we we can learn a lot about heterogeneity like uh you mentioned earlier uh classification uh what are the limits we can understand by using contrast agents. So both both are I think needed um to continue. So there is some interest also in multimodality coming back to the near infrared optical imaging uh that I was working in the past. So now there are the field has advanced since I last worked on it and I guess I've learned some more from doing other areas. So there is some interest in coming back to the near infrared optical ultrasound and these multimodality techniques and how can you combine information from these uh so those would be some of the future goals.",
