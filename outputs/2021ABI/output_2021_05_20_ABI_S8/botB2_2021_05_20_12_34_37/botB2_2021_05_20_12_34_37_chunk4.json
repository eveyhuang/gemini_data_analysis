We have no safety studies, no information. Let's throw it in a patient. Look, whereas on a cell line, that's perfectly feasible to accomplish.",

If you're talking about just in cellular level in out, you know, not in vivo, then probably label free is not required as much. Uh, if we are trying to find solutions for in vivo, I think if you want to get enough signal out, then uh, then that that would be the where the questions might lead to can is it even possible? But I really like the idea of the the hybrid uh thinking of new ways to uh think about these nanoparticles uh, you know, which could be less harmful uh and might still work for in vivo in some capacity.",

So they can actually they have pretty clear scattering signatures that can be used to mark them um in a label free way. and this has been shown in microfluidics, but there I think Minnie's point really comes in that if you want to image this in vivo, then you'll have, you know, in the depth of the body, many multiple scattering effects. So how can you filter those out in a clever way um for instance getting rid of background signals um and there for instance there are some studies that use uh nanoparticles that are up converting. So for instance you excite them with infrared light which can go deeper into the tissue and they emit fluorescent light. So so there are um some approaches like that to address the depth issue as well.",

So one for me the challenge is to actually remove the long angle scatter so that it doesn't interfere with the small angle scatter. You know like the small angle scatter resides in the first harmonic and the you know the uh the baseline has the small long angle scatter. So there are lots of methodologies as you know that to remove scatter and we have been very successful with for thicknesses as thick as a breast. Okay, so like you can clear uh a lot of that.
