And I'm generally speaking interested in the molecular structure and function of proteins and how they interact with one another both in cells and outside of cells in the context of neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. And so we sort of kind of try to design sensors or or experiment where we can kind of probe the coupled interaction between structural changes in molecules and how that affects cellular fate and metabolism. So I guess from there I'll ping pong to Anuradha.",

      "transcript": "Uh, hello everyone. This is Anirudh here. Uh, I'm currently an assistant professor at the University of Toledo, uh, in the Department of Physics. Uh, before this, I was at UCLA and uh, before that I did my grad school from University of Michigan. Uh, I also hold affiliate position at the University of Michigan. Um, so my research, uh, it can broadly be divided into two parts. One is very similar to what Kevin mentioned. So I also work with nanoparticles. Um, we develop different types of nanoparticles, polymeric based, metallic, hybrid. Um, and then we use it to get different kinds of information from animals or even from inside the cells. Um, and with these nanoparticles, we use different kind of optical imaging modalities such as fluorescence, photoacoustics, um, and even basically use it to enhance the scattering from from samples. Uh, we use them for diagnostic applications as well as for therapeutic applications. So it would be like theranostic nanoparticles. But there is also the other part of my research where I work with label free microscopy. Uh, so one of the things I do it's called holographic microscopy, uh, which basically depends on the phase change of light as it goes through the sample. And the type of imaging we do, it's an on chip imaging methodology where we do not use any lenses to image. So what this does is it lets you image over a very wide field of view so that uh, the field of view is almost 20 to 30 times compared to a conventional microscope. So yeah, I'm looking I look forward to talking to all of you guys and exchanging different ideas. Um, and so let me ping pong to the next person. I guess Joyati Day.",

Um, so the yeah, I work on like, uh, like, uh, unfortunately not in a like, uh, at a much higher resolution like a, uh, I mean, clinical resolution. So I work on, um, mammography. So I one of the things that, um, I'm working on is, uh, building a phase contrast X-ray system for, uh, you know, finding the microcalcification clusters, um, quite early even before the tumor is developed. And so, um, so, uh, we hope that, um, the three, like I, uh, have that innovation, phase image and the, um, the, uh, what's it the, the scatter image, small angle scatter, it's a coherent scattering, scattering process.",

      "transcript": "So, uh, Dr. Nim? Yes. So you're next. Yeah, I think yeah, I think uh, even though we work on so my life we've been working on label free microscopy for a while, but uh, the truth is, you know, we have been working towards the hybrid label free and labels uh, more recently. That's something that we feel probably even more exciting. For example, uh, for example, you know, in my own community, you know, Rama microscopy, most of people in the Rama microscopy have been working on label free imaging because uh, you know, that's one of the selling point of Rama that you don't need a fluorescent labels, you're just using the chemical bond, you can uh, extract information. But the truth is, if you actually could deliver some, you know, cleverly designed labels, you actually could, you know, gain even more information or even uh, new information that are beyond the fluorescence. So just give you one example, uh, we use heavy water because heavy water, you know, all the cells, tissues and animals use heavy water as a not only as a chemical not only as a solvent but actually also as a chemical reagent for a lot of synthetic activities. Since like protein synthesis, DNA synthesis all requires water. So if you dilute water into a heavy water, the deuterium bond will actually participate in all the synthetic pathways and eventually will end up in the biological molecules. And uh, and the carbon deuterium bond is well known to be Rama active. So we use that as a reporter or sensor depending how you call it, uh, to look at, you know, synthetic activities of cells, tissues or even animals and we can extract all those metabolic activity information.",
