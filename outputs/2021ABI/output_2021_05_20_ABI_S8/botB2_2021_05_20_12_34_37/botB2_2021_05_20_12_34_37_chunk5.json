It's I can send you a potential paper, you know if people are interested in looking at it. It's alternative method and it has lots of complementary things to x-rays. So just one of like one of the papers I'm sure there are other many others. So for biological just just wanted to throw it out there that some of the methods have automatic you know like the one of the advantages of interferometry is that you're getting coherent scatter and it's undiluted with the long angle you know the blurring mechanism.",

So but yeah so for metal like what we are interested is in bone you know like a little bit bone and bone and so basically it has less metal metal inter metal artifacts than x-rays so that's that's one of the things that we are interested in.",
