Okay? So, are we going to follow a line of thought where we think that the signals that are generated by the microbes that are present in the gut vary as a function of time and do we then want to change those signals as a function of time? And do we think there is a cyclic reputation of those of the production of those signals?",

I think if we define what are the functions and functional modules that are interesting or targets for perturbation, I think that's going to be really key to all of this because then you can define the genetic material which you can then, for example, drop into a microbe or identify microbiota that exist in a natural community as a source for probiotic supplementation, right? I do think there's a whole component of spatial temporal variation and how we think about delivery that's important. So, for example, a lot of the analysis are done on fecal samples, right? If you actually want to get it into the small intestine, like that's going to be potentially much more challenging where you require completely different tools.
