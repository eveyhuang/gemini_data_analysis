So like ketogenic diet for epilepsy, for instance, is shown to modulate glutamate and glutamine ratios in the brain. And so that's one very specific thing.

Okay? So, are we going to follow a line of thought where we think that the signals that are generated by the microbes that are present in the gut vary as a function of time and do we then want to change those signals as a function of time?

I do think there's a whole component of spatial temporal variation and how we think about delivery that's important. So, for example, a lot of the analysis are done on fecal samples, right? If you actually want to get it into the small intestine, like that's going to be potentially much more challenging where you require completely different tools.
