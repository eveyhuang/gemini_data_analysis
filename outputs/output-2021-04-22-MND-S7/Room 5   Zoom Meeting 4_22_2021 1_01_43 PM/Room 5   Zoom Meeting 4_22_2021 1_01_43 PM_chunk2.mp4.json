I'm curious because we have seen with different kinds of like dietary manipulations that certainly there is like some still variation even in the response or the activity. Do people know what the exact activity even we want to modulate for benefiting neurobiology?",

I don't think there's one thing we can point to that's that's universal for a neurological outcome. But there's definitely examples of specific things. So like ketogenic diet for epilepsy, for instance, is shown to modulate glutamate and glutamine ratios in the brain. And so that's one very specific thing. But I don't think we could generally make some argument that modulating the microbiome in a certain way will always have a neurological effect.",

Like, if you think about electronics and telecommunication and you know, things like that, you have a periodic waveform and then you try to change the amplitude of it or the frequency of that in a time in a temporal fashion. Okay? So, are we going to follow a line of thought where we think that the signals that are generated by the microbes that are present in the gut vary as a function of time and do we then want to change those signals as a function of time? And do we think there is a cyclic reputation of those of the production of those signals?",

            "transcript": "Yeah, maybe I think to that point, I think there's potentially difference between modulating the composition or the function, right? I think if we define what are the functions and functional modules that are interesting or targets for perturbation, I think that's going to be really key to all of this because then you can define the genetic material which you can then, for example, drop into a microbe or identify microbiota that exist in a natural community as a source for probiotic supplementation, right? I do think there's a whole component of spatial temporal variation and how we think about delivery that's important. So, for example, a lot of the analysis are done on fecal samples, right? If you actually want to get it into the small intestine, like that's going to be potentially much more challenging where you require completely different tools. So, I think both, like, how do you control that in space as well as in time are probably just different ways to think about that.",

So first of all, to identify how the microbiome or specific molecules that are produced by the microbiome are modulating host response or immune response or any other disease, any specific disease. And then try to supplement with this specific molecule rather than trying to change microbial composition because this is this is challenging.",

For example, supplementing with metabolites and what's the permanence of that versus So for example, like I think a lot of early probiotic data at least suggests that even like the bacteria and yogurt, for example, that will only transiently colonize your gut for a couple days and then pass through. So if you're thinking about effective strategies for modulating the microbiome, what kind of time scale are we talking about? This is more of a long-term question, like if you were thinking of a clinical intervention or something, but would this come in the form of a supplement that you would have to administer like multiple",
