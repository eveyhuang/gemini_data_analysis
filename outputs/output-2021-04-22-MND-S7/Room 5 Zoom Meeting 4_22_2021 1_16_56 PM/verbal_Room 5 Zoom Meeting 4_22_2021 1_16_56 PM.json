Inflammation does seem to pop up consistently. I forget where my thought was going here. But the mechanism of action by which inflammation might be mediating these different effects. We definitely know the microbiome modulates systemic immune responses and modulates neuroimmune responses. But how is that signal, that inflammatory signal, being potentiated from the gut to the brain? I think there's probably a session tomorrow on neuroinflammation specifically that we can all talk about. But there's these cell dependent effects where peripheral immune cells are getting, are being trained in the gut or getting signals directly from the gut and then crossing to the brain. But there's also the fact that the descending signals from the brain, from the spinal cord, and from the Vegas are actively also receiving these inflammatory signals. And we don't quite know how inflammation in the gut is telling those pathways to become dysfunctional or have altered function. So I think inflammation could be playing a role kind of in those two different, two different ways. But also then if inflammation is playing such a big role, then maybe the microbiome, we can bypass it. If we can, we don't need to necessarily modulate the microbiome if we can modulate inflammation, which there's a lot of really good pharmaceuticals that can do. ",

There are so many factors that are, that, you know, whether it's actual individual strains or communities of strains or specific metabolites. How do we go down to the mechanistic level to be able to find those specific actors to be then go back for the engineering component, right? People have done a number of these pro-biotic studies and looked at potential effects, but very few actual mechanistic kind of, you know, down to the molecular level insights, or at least the ratio of those is very poor. So are there ways, for example, that we can drastically increase the throughput at which we can discover new neuromodulatory microbiota without going through testing individual strains and then measuring brain activity or other systemic activity? Because I think that cycle seems so slow that I feel like a lot of effort is going towards that, right? And so we're almost kind of like, if something happens, we see something, and then there's this lamppost effect where basically all of the work is focused on in those specific areas.

So, typically, this is a system identification problem or network reconstruction problem. If you have very high quality temporal data and suppose we have absolute abundance, then there are a bunch of methods available so that they can infer the interspecies interactions. If you have, if you don't have the very high quality temporal data, if you, but you have high quality static samples, then there are any, there are also some methods available so that you can infer the interspecies interactions. So my point is that you don't have to always rely on the metabolic method. Okay, we've developed a method to analyze cross-sectional data. So suppose you have a bunch of static samples, roughly static samples, then the key idea is that the interspecies interactions somehow are encoded in the difference between different static samples, as long as they share some common species. And mathematically, you can prove that the interspecies interactions are somehow encoded in the statistic sample difference. But the point that we, this require a large number of samples. Suppose you have 1,000 species, then this require more than 5,000 samples with different species collections. This is a big number. And also we require absolute abundance. Suppose we can provide this type of data, then we can reconstruct the network for you. It's an ecological network. It's a direct and weighted signed graph. ",
