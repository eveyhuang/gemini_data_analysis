That's why it's okay because the scale up requires a lot more bigger scale demonstration, but this is scale out means they copy paste, copy paste. So that although economics scale may not be as good, but you'll get there faster. So very different approach compared to power plants.",

How to stitch them together, very important. And how to capture CO2 and deliver to the surface of catalyst so that you can do reactive separation, huge research area. I'm sure that you're going to be talking about it tomorrow for sure.",
