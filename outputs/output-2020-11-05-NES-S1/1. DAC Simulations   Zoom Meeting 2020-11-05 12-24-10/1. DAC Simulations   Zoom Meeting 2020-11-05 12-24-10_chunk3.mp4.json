The technologies, we shouldn't do one technology fits all because if you're doing direct air capture, again, power plant I built in New York versus Beijing can be exactly the same. But direct air capture in Beijing versus New York would be very different. Just because we have different environment, right? So, um, something to think about. Either they have to be different system or they have to be operated differently.",

Um concentration issue. I think it's better to replace it with thermodynamic limitation, right? Because I think the that problem is the thermodynamic, right? It's a it's a thermodynamically limited problem, right? We know that the mass balance is an issue. So I guess it's better to change it change it to thermodynamic limitation.",

Where to place it, how to place it. But because none of us are expert in simulation, we can almost think that deck is like a black box. And then they can assume like this black box captures 60% of CO2 at the rate of whatever. Then they can do it becomes more atmospherate modeling. But none of you are in that area. So how about this? If I ask you, right? The whole point of this, um, the event is that first of all, or you guys are rising stars in your field, we want you guys to think out of box and collaborate with each other, so create a whole new area of science and research areas, right? So if I ask you that you can do deck plus conversion or whatever system, you have to put it somewhere with the minimum environmental impacts. How would you do it?",

I think it's important for any technology to uh to be actually considered um if it's going to be considered as a viable option, the benefit cost analysis should be considered as well. What I mean, for example, if we consider X Y axis, right? where we talk where our Y axis is energy or X axis, let's say, uh is just again different technologies. I think we need to have an additional access where we consider the implementation, the cost, technology readiness, feasibility, right? All of these things. But also at the same time other other um other considerations like, you know, logistics of deployment, like um public acceptance, right? incentives structures. In other words, uh we I think as scientists, we we're not only we not only need to focus on the the science part of it. I think it's also imperative to consider benefit cost analysis. I think this is important especially when it comes to DAC because we know that is just like I said is uh is from mass conservation point of view, that's an issue, right? Now, the amount of energy input is most is larger than the amount of um energy actually output. So the the output energy that we get and also again thermodynamic issue that I mentioned or energy intensiveness of this problem. So to summarize, I think what I call benefit cost analysis is important as well.",

She does biomaterials and she said that when you wear mask, there's increased local concentration of CO2 inside your mask, right? Especially N95 because the pressure drop is high, right? And then what happens is elevated CO2 concentration has impact on human alertness, like the nervous system. So that they wanted to ask me, can we have insert in the mask so that which has grabbing onto CO2? Actually, we have technology like that. Now for mask, divers divers have to wear the breathing in and out with the oxygen tank, right? So they usually have a scrubber for so they recycle the oxygen, but they want to scrub out the CO2 so you don't get toxicated. And usually they use lime as a scrubbing column.",

You know, since that direct air capture is also intermittent too because the temperature is swinging throughout the day and all this. So your operation unless you're changing your reactor system all the time, the speed stock is fluctuating so much, you have to operate with that fluctuation. So how to do that smoothly and better, right? For example, your CO2 conversion system needs to be consistently like a steady state operation when deck is not. There are a lot of questions on these integration of different pieces when they have very different uh operating behaviors.",
