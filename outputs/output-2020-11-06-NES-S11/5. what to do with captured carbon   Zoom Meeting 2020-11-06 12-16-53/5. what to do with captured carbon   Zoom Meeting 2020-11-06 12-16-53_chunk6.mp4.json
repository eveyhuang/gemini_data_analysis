So the bigger your operation is, the more um environmentally or the least less environmentally impactful they are and the more economical they are. So a lot of the small ones fold in the US. Um just because they're like family farm scale. Whereas the really big ones actually have a shot at price parity. And I think one of the points that someone brought up is really novel is it's they're more interesting in areas where it's really hard to produce food because you can do it either in an urban environment or in a remote location. So like um in some of the more remote villages in Hawaii, they've got a lot of these systems where it's just really expensive environmentally and economically to bring food to the villages.",
