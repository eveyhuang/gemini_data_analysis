Um I'll say that the well, a couple things maybe, but in terms of the the one minute sort of idea or thing I'm thinking about, um you know, one thing I'll just throw out there is sort of thinking about ways of building sort of multifunctional uh either interfaces or materials that that sort of satisfy a number of the requirements that you need for CO2 separation, especially from air. So, um you know, so you you if you're doing say CO2 capture from air, you want something that's the oxygen that's not uh sort of sensitive to oxygen. Um you also want ideally something that's non-volatile. So if if you're doing this in an organic solvent, you're going to have issues with solvent loss. Um and then you want something that's uh redox active or that sort of responds to an electric field or potential. Um it will capture CO2 in one state and releases in another. And I'm curious as to whether it it makes any sense and you know, maybe in in typically what you would do is you pick the solvent and then you pick the active material and you sort of mix the two together, you know, you sort of build your system from there. Um I'm curious whether it makes sense to also think about trying to do or make sort of multifunctional sorbents that would fulfill a number of these requirements simultaneously. So for example, you start with uh like an ionic liquid, for example, which would not where you wouldn't have as much of an issue with uh volatility. And that is sort of your backbone and then you sort of build on top of that some sort of functionality or something either redox active or electric field responsive that does your that does sort of the switching uh sort of CO2 reversible CO2 binding release component. Um so I'm just sort of that's sort of what I'm I'm thinking about. Um is is whether you could build these sort of chemical uh these sort of new material systems and then you you you know, you put that in like a reactor um and one could then think about how effective it actually works in a in a real system, but yeah, that's that's one thought.",

And we can also uh improve the selectivity for CO2 and suppress it for oxygen to improve the sensitivity. But ultimately the redox active carrier is um you know, can be sensitive to oxygen and not necessarily maybe the electrolyte itself. But the um I think the main one of the main problems is um the ionic liquids are viscous, no matter you know, how you design them, they are going to be end up, you know, more viscous than your aqueous systems.

And then if you swing it back, you oxidize it back to the immune form, it would release it. Um, but I don't, yeah. The oxygen sensitivity is a good question.

So many of us in this room work on CO2 reduction. So one of the things that we've thought about is instead of reducing CO2, let's reduce the alkox. It would be an alkyl carbonate or carbamate, right? These are the products of CO2 capture with amines and hydroxides or alkoxides, respectively. And if we could just directly reduce it from there, that's a solution. And I would argue that some of the CO2 reduction alkaline cells basically do that, right? Because you're probably not reducing directly CO2, but you're reducing bicarbonate or carbonate at those pHs. And so I think that is an interesting approach, and so sort of just reshifting our thinking about CO2 reduction to reducing bound CO2 to some of these capture agents directly. And then related to that, I realized there's no geochemist in the room, but I know that in sequestration, right? There's certain minerals that are, this is my limited knowledge, that are stable to bury underground. And so can we electrochemically generate the precursors to these minerals to then directly synthesize them, capture, and then just bury that? And so those are just some of my thoughts, is that maybe we don't want to regenerate, we just want to make the product directly from the CO2 that's captured.",

One, David just touched on on basically CO2 conversion or capture into solids. Something that we somewhat started doing in our lab. I'm not sure if oxalates are any more useful than carbonates, but it's something that has been pursued in the literature about 20 or 30 years ago, and it's actually doable, basically doing electrochemical conversion of CO2 to oxalates, which is a solid. And then another point, the solid state chemist and me immediately starts thinking about, well, if I wanted to give a surface to Phil or to Jenny so they could do their reactions, what would it be? And I'm guessing whether or not if there's an opportunity here for nitrite-based porous or nitrite-based moths or nitrite-based types of materials that can perhaps give us the opportunity to create that amine that we've been talking about. I mean, there's been some success. I'm not sure if we are all convinced of the success of doing nitrogen reduction using nitrite-based materials. And then that sort of leads me to perhaps a super off idea of how about if we could, we know that flue gas has a lot of nitrogen in there and very little CO2. So who knows if we could like have a double whammy here where we do CO2 recovery of flue gas on the nitrite surface that will take the majority of the nitrogen of the flue gas and convert it",

But I think within the within the thermodynamics we mostly focused on like enthalpic effects and not really like entropic effects. So the one thing that I have been fantasizing about is um since we're on the topic of electrochemical simulation. Um can we think about materials that would like have some induced entropic effects that would drive uh let's say the regeneration of CO2. I mean apart from enthalpic effects we can also have you know the entropic effects. Um and related to this, you know, we also discussed about these redux active CO2 carriers or redux active molecules, nucleophile. Um how about um designing the solvent around it. So you know this reduction potentials was too negative. I think um Jenny mentioned that. Well, I think we can design the interaction between these molecules with the environment to shift those potentials. So for example, I mean since I work with ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents, I'm thinking about like hydrogen bonded systems that can interact with these species and shift the redox potentials so that you are in a better place and not like driving some other unwanted side reactions. Um and that has some entropy theme underneath it. Um I think those are the things that I thought about. And another thing is um we have worked with like encapsulated ionic liquids. So these had um these had graphene oxide material in its shell. So we thought okay, we have a conductive uh you know shell material. And initially we thought that we can use it at like energy storage, but it was kind of a naive idea because these are um you know, um kind of encapsulated liquids and they don't feel any voltage uh distribution. But in the context of CO2 capture and conversion or regeneration, um they can actually work as electrode materials where the ionic liquid or the core material can serve as like CO2 reservoirs. So you don't have to worry about um you know, have to bring CO2 to uh to the electrode surface. Um I mean you can tell me if it's a crazy idea but um something that that I think is something that we thought about in the past and kind of um you know, fits into this discussion I think.",

The nice thing about electrochemical technologies as compared to say thermochemical technologies that is it you could be more effective when you're smaller, right? Thermochemical technologies usually make a lot of hay when you're really large and can take advantage of sort of heat integration and infrastructure, right? And so, you know, one of the things is, are there applications that you could think about where electrochemical technologies or some of the things we're talking about here are uniquely positioned because I assume that in cabin capture, it's really just like, you know, alkaline pellets, right? Um, you know, Apollo 13 or something like that, right? And you know, if that's true, then the question would be, are there opportunities to kind of say, are there, can we sort of walk down the technology curve from let's say carbon capture to maybe in cabins to maybe buildings to eventually direct air capture?",

You see you're taking, you know, you're capturing from 400 BPM and you want to go to one bar because you want to see crystal or uh convert. Um, if instead you still capture from air, but your requirement was only to go to like two or three percent, let's say, that concentration of CO2 would be useful if you were doing something like algae. So, like algae actually don't need to go all the way to 100%. If you if you get up to a couple percent, even 5%, um, they they can be pretty effective. So you can, you know, use it to do things like algae, um, like uh like fuels for aviation fuel or whatever. You can, you know, you can there's a whole bunch of other work engineering algae to make particular um products. But but that could be sort of another like a sort of a step down um the curve where you are doing CO2 capture. Um and it is useful uh because, you know, we're not going to get electric planes anytime soon.

So, for example, you could sort of think of it as flow batteries are an easy example because you can separate power and energy. And so if you want an energy intensive application, the cost is dominated by what's in your tank. Um, if you have a power dominant application, it's dominated by what the what it cost you to make the reactor. Uh in these kind of systems, it's a bit different, right? And it would probably the way you'd want to think about it is throughput, right? So it's kind of what is the capital cost of your reactor? And then how much CO2 can you put through it because that's how you're going to make money, right? Um, and so that's how you should think about it. I mean, capital cost is important because, you know, bank ability, like someone's got to pay for the thing, right? And so if you think about like the first solar cells, they they kind of stunk, right? But they're still working and they're small and you can put them on your roof, right? Um, and so, you know, if for electrochemical systems, you could build at that sort of scale, local residential scale, and that allows you to do a lot more learning um as you go, and allows you also to make smaller products, which mean that there's less opportunities for for screw ups and a lot less money involved. Um, for a lot of sort of, you know, the larger scale systems like I guess carbon engineering, I mean, I think that system is is is pretty big in the base case. And I don't know how many of them they've built. I'm not so I've seen a lot of pretty pictures, but I don't know if I've actually seen a plant. Um, and so there's some some something about like, well, who's paying for this? How confident are you that this is going to work? Yada yada yada, this kind of stuff, right? So I don't think electrochemical systems can be infinitely small for sure. Um, but you could be a lot smaller than thermochemical systems. And actually if you look at scaling analysis, thermochemical systems can beat out electrochemical systems at large enough scale, right? Just because of heat integration, we're really good at that.
