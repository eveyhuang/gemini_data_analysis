Um, I I did notice that we never even mentioned the word tandem catalysis uh in this section. Um, I don't really want to bias the conversation but uh uh I mean we can yeah, so is this still viable? I mean do we have to make CO2 to CN directly electrochemically work if we actually have uh like basically a century of experience working with carbon monoxide. Um, so I don't",

So with this question about how to design catalysts to function in dilute streams, we actually try to cheat that a little bit with the development of these dual functional materials, right? And so you have this catalyst material that captures the CO2 out of dilute streams and then the second step is then to react the captured CO2 which is in the form of a carbonate into some um valuable added products. So the way that we've been trying to circumvent that at least with thermal catalysis is developing a material that can capture in dilute streams and then react that after you concentrate that CO2 stream then react it later. Um, but I was also listening to the conversation about carbon carbon carbon carbon coupling electrocatalytically and it's also very difficult um with thermal catalysis as well. And people have been thinking about um oxidative coupling of methane, you know, with CO2, uh where you can make like ethylene. And the biggest issue there, the selectivity is low. There has been decades of research on this field and the needle has been moved only a tiny bit. And so um, you know, it's like where do we address that? How can we improve catalyst materials to actually do carbon carbon coupling of captured CO2 as well. So that's a prominent um question in thermal catalysis.

But I wonder if maybe kind of bringing in some of these ideas that Leslie's talking about and you know, what if you had a, you know, thermal catalyst with the direct air capture and you're using like, you know, uh thermal energy from the plant in order to power, I mean you've got these big fans running. I don't really know that much about DAC to be honest. I'm in the field of uh thermal catalysis as well, but you know, wondering if maybe there was a different um, you know, a different method there that could potentially work.",

But I I like this this idea in general though of addressing the question of how to do uh chemistry at low concentrations of CO2. I love the idea of circumventing that by saying we're going to concentrate the CO2. I I think it's I think it's a great strategy to that uh problem in general.",
