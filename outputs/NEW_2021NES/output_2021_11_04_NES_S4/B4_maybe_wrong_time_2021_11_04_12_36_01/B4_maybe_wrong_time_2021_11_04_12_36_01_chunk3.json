And um when I think about the proposed um solutions that we have, for example, we can do carbon storage, that seems to be the one that will get the most immediate climate change benefit. But if we're looking in the long term, what sort of value added products will be helpful um that will sort of coincide or or um um be uh something that we can use in analogy to petrochemical based products. And so that's a question that I always think of because um I think it's really great science that we can develop CO2 and methane and make it into aromatics or all of these different nice molecules, but I don't want us to end up in the same situation that we're in now and and we have another silog of like, okay, now what do we do with these products.

Um and so from the energy conversion frontier, um some of the biggest questions that we ask is like what is the double layer, what is the structure of the double layer and how does that um like how does that affect um the conversion process. And so kind of the thing that I wrote down was like in terms of again, completely biased in terms of the things that we've been thinking about for quite some time. Um but you know, we don't know what the structure of the electric double layer is. Um how do ions order at interfaces and how do they interact with intermediates is something um that I think needs to be resolved if we're going to um design efficient energy conversion devices. Um then there's just all these questions about, you know, whether we're looking at gas based devices or aqueous or solution phase and that's a whole another question. Um but just at the heart of it is how do we what is the organization of ions at these interfaces is the question.",

And I think a lot um for me one of the important questions when it comes to design these types of compounds is is from a materials perspective which we spend a lot of time talking about, there's a whole um volume of material that may or may not be participating in in the overall reactivity of the surfaces. And so how do you leverage the surface chemistry to optimize the reactivity, keeping in mind that these defects as Kelsey mentioned or or other types of things happening within the bulk of the solid is also playing a role in the net chemistry. And so from that perspective, how can you then design active sites at the surface of the material on the atomic level that will then enhance your overall reactivity. And so selfishly that brings you to clusters, which are obviously the answer to everything. So um so I think that like for me thinking along those continuum and in selecting the types of of catalysts um that you're interested in studying is really important.",
