So it's like something how to approach the statistics maybe something I have to worry about and I I feel like like uh artificial intelligence might be very helpful because the computer they can generate whatever whatever we want. So if we can actually come back to some difficulty to find some molecular descriptors or any descriptors of the system if I can capture one and maybe I can let my machine to generate all the probabilities and if I already have a relationship they can just speed out the the the final final result final product.",

With respect to machine learning as as I think you're all probably aware to get a good model requires a lot of data and uh and even then it's of course dependent on what what you train and and so there um so you know I think I think it's it as uh more data becomes available even you know experimental data there will be ways to use experimental data too to to to train models and uh and it will help. It won't I don't think in general it's going to provide much insight but it it could potentially offer some suggestions for future directions of molecules or materials. Um Ellen.",

And I know that we have to propose some design principle but usually I strongly correlated to this what I called structure features or environmental features. So as I mentioned earlier I hope what I model is what exactly is there but but it's still very difficult to know that I keep asking experimentalist do you know do you have exact control and do you think the surface configuration actually change in the react in the reaction procedure but usually I cannot get very good answer. Like I know like we do the like the CO2 reduction on copper but I I feel like the the surface charge of the copper I also say maybe the oxidation number it keep changing. These are the things that actually all leads to the complication that we we we want to think about but it's it's hard.",

I mean it's it certainly is much better when you can when you you can find an experimentalist who's willing to do those fundamental well characterized experiments. So for example you can do electrochemistry on single crystal electrodes right? And so that's that is a way but even then things can change under operating potentials and so um and and so it but you can get closer to something that is uh easier to compare against that's all I can say.

Uh so like the fuel cell community has like decades of research which shows that in a you know a catalyst layer where we have you know multiple materials where you might have a polymer which is an ion conductor might at a certain length scale might um go into a confinement and that will affect transport effects right you know. Um and so I think that like in I get like for this whole energy conversion particular focus that we're talking about with the CO2 um reduction uh there's a whole kind of emerging field in terms of understanding how do we combine materials for synergistic transport and um the reaction um so I think that again most of our conversation has been focused on the mechanism which is widely important but also as we think about synergizing electron and gas transport it's going to be a little bit more challenging to think about what's the synergistic combo.",
