So, um, it's the kind of the two-prong question of do we need to wait or even to say, do we even have the time to wait and look at this from the atomic scale up and take every step there, or can we learn from some of the previous chemical process industry to see, um, we need kind of the large scale testing and assessment there to feed the relevant conditions into the the fundamental science.",

So as part of the first year of the C look, we have developed a gas tight rotating cylinder electrode cell where we put the model uh copper polyline copper electrode and we rotate it at different uh rates. And as you rotate it, even though you have the same potential, you actually start to see dramatic changes in in selectivity. We already also we have the preprint in in our website. So what we see is that actually mass transport control selectivity and the the the problem is a little bit more complex. So you actually have a lot of uh CO that is a main reaction intermediate that dissolves and hangs around near the surface of the electrode long enough. So at the the near the surface of the electrode it actually behaves as a sort of CSTR, a continuous stirred tank reactor and then uh what happens is that we get a lot of high uh conversion of CO and uh theory is trying to do a lot of mechanistic understanding of of those systems actually on under high uh conversion of CO and uh typically you don't study kinetics under those conditions, right? Uh but now that I think we have a good uh system, right? Uh uh a reactor that you can control mass transport and and see the influence of mass transport in electrocatalysis, I think uh now what we see is that we can actually understand the the mechanism of CO2 reduction on copper uh much easily. Uh it makes a lot of sense and then uh what you have in gas diffusion electrodes is essentially a system where the the residence time of carbon monoxide is very long. Uh so",
