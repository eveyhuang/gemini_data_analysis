Uh so long story short, I think the challenge was to get an electrochemical cell that allows you to control mass transport and at the same time allows you to do product quantification and detection. Um so I think we have accomplished that through and I think that that that should open the the door to scale up these systems.",

I'd like I'm very grateful for David's support and for our facilitators Chris and Ellen as well as our excellent participants. So there were several aspects that came up uh over the course of our discussion uh particularly in the context of the need for DAC. Um so one of the nice things about direct air capture is that it can be deployed independently of point source emissions and as we continue as we continue to use fossil fuels, there is going to be an increased need for DAC, particularly from sectors that are challenging to decarbonize such as transportation.",

            "transcript": "So for example, if you're in regions of the world where uh moisture contents are different or in certain locations where the compositions of air are even different, separation technologies will need to be tailored for such regions. Uh this is a challenge but it's also an opportunity because it locks it it helps us unlock many fresh ideas and innovations in the context of DAC. Uh and perhaps you can take some of that understanding and translate that for CO2 capture as well from diverse set of um emissions. So with that said, our team uh sees the challenge of variability of compositions as something that can actually unlock more innovation. So we think it's actually a positive in the context of uh innovating in this space. We also think that understanding durability, economic costs and incentive structures are crucial under real world operating conditions and this actually goes back to the point that uh Carlos had made about uh the need for molecular scale science as well as the process scale engineering to come together to inform economic costs and incentive structure incentive structures. So they so really there is a need for cross scale thinking in this particular line of work. Uh this line this approach may be unconventional for some of the other research areas but in this area, it is crucially needed.",

We wrapped up our discussion from a rather big picture perspective of where DAC and CO2 capture are headed and so when we look at industrial decarbonization, we're starting to see that there is defossilization of crucial commodities like ammonia, even cement and construction materials. This is something that's going to get realized over the course of the next 10 to 20 years or so. So in this context of defossilization, what is going to be the emerging role of DAC and CO2 capture? It's an open ended question but that is where we choose to wrap up our discussion. So thank you for the opportunity to present.",

            "transcript": "Um we took a little bit of a different perspective from the previous group and looked at a little bit more of the upscale challenge. Um uh I think the previous group kind of articulated that uh there's opportunity for DAC to be um uh operate uh independent of point of source um applications. Um one of the things that was a pretty like well established thought process that we talked in great detail was um the value proposition of combining point of source um treatment with DAC. Um given the fact that a lot of the infrastructure can be repurposed um and having that onsite is going to be potentially an economic advantage for that approach. Um we talked a lot about Zorbins, um uh just we talked about Ecam, electrochemistry and Zorbins. Um most of our discussion was on Zorbins with a little bit of echem at the end, but from the Zorbins we talked about it'd be nice to have a singular Zorbint that operated um across various concentrations so you could um have it um very versatile in terms of operating with point of source as well as direct air capture and both of those applications where you have concentrations. We talked about the challenges again with different properties based off of geographic locations and why that might be a more of a challenge to have a singular um Zorbint. Um we talked about uh again, larger scale issues um in terms of treatment trains, um whether we want to integrate um direct air capture with point of source or we want to combine those um to produce um uh you know, fuels or integrate it with conversion applications. Um how we integrate multiple technologies is going to be a um energy systems level challenge. Um we also talked a little bit about uh kind of how we can innovative ways for um integrating direct air capture. There was a lot of discussion on um transportation um areas like planes, submarines, spacecraft, things where we have a lot of moving parts already and how can we potentially utilize these systems that have existing infrastructure that would be valuable for DAC um as a way to um excentuate DAC as it exists. Um given that the fossil fuel and DOE announced today the earth shot for $100 um per ton for DAC. Um we talked about what are pathways toward that goal. Um whether the innovation um and advancement in science and new technology will get us there. Um some of the thoughts were really about how we can just use repurposing um and potentially the less glamorous um approach of like how can we take um abandoned coal mines or abandoned infrastructure and repurpose that for DAC systems may be the fastest way to getting to that goal. Um however ambitious that is because most um DAC is around 300 to $500 currently. Um we briefly talked about policy um and uh the different opportunities and there was an a one cited evidence of of a uh positive policy um or mutualistically positive policy um where farmers if we're thinking about um carbon um capture in soils, um there's mutualistic benefit to the farmer for soil health and different ways that we can inter um interject policy to um accelerate the adoption of DAC. Um and lastly, we ended our conversation not to um let electrochemistry um not hit the stage a little bit about really um the versatility of electrochemical systems for carbon capture and carbon conversion. Um but other than that, I think that's really covers what we discussed.",
