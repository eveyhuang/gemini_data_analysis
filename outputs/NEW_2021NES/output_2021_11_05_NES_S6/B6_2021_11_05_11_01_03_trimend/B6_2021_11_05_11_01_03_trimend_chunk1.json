So I think it's been long enough that if we're missing one person, I think we're just missing them. And so in the interest of time, we'll just get started. And so, welcome everybody. Let's have our our second breakout of the Scialog. I am going to start with a few logistics. I think at this point, you've done it once, so you know how we're rolling, but just in case. They have posted we're we're session 2.6 and if you go to the Scialog folder, let me move this. You will see that this is the facilitator folder, it always takes a while for the actual folder to load. But you should see a Google Doc for rough notes and then the slide that we can complete or that you're going to want to complete for the report out. Oh of course now it's taking a while to load. But anyway, everything gets done on Drive and therefore the documentation, you know, it's easy where to put it. Okay, so now I got it. So you go to virtual meeting materials, you'll see the rough notes for 2.6. So that's a Word document and if you go to the main folder, there's the Scialog meeting slides, which is the central slide deck and that's where we will or where you will add your contribution for 2.6, which is on slide, let's see, 40.

And also that means that we need a recorder. So yesterday we had the same person do both, but other groups didn't and it seems like it works well also when there's one there's one person doing each. So one person records on the rough notes and the other one is more in charge of distilling ideas for the key points. So either way it's fine by me, but I need volunteers. So who wants to volunteer for either role or both? Somebody that hasn't done it, somebody that didn't do it yesterday. Who wants to volunteer for either role or both?",

And I'm an assistant professor at the University of California, Riverside in the Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering. My research group mainly focuses on the development of chemical processes and heterogeneous catalysis for the breakdown of things that we consider waste. So for the purposes of this conference is the waste carbon. And so what we really develop is catalytic absorbents that can selectively absorb CO2 and convert them into either fuels or syngas and and right now our focus is on olefins.",

I'm from Yale University, chemical engineering. And my research interest actually is a heterogeneous photocatalyst. So you can think about initially doing hydrogen production from water by using particle-based photocatalysts. But now I'm actually expanding that to any of the heterogeneous thermal catalysis that actually do that as a photocatalyst platform by making chemical synthesis, organic synthesis, and etc. So that's what we do.
