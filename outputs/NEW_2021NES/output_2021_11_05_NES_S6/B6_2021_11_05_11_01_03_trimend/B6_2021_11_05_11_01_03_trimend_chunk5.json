They there may very well be but uh that's a great question.",

You have your active catalyst component embedded in other functionality that is helping to concentrate methane. The problem is methane in particular is difficult to get to bind strongly to anything. But um people have shown things like that can help for CO2 where you have functional groups nearby that bring CO2 in and then drop it off at the catalyst. Um that might be a way that you could take some of these catalysts that don't work well with low partial pressures of methane and increase the local concentration of methane enough that they'll actually hit it and do catalysis. I I I'm guessing people have had thoughts down these lines, but I haven't seen it pop up in the field of porous materials anyways, like in metal organic frameworks.",

So if I think about the contrast between CO2 and methane capture, um with CO2, I know how at low enough pressures, so let's say 400 ppm equivalent, how to create a chemical bond uh with a surface um at those low concentrations with a high enough affinity between the molecule and the surface. With methane, I can't envision specifically an electronic interaction between an active site and methane that would essentially bind methane or give me that sort of a sharp affinity and shape of iso shape of the isotherm. So maybe it's easier with CO2 because it's been done and I we've seen it in the literature, but that's that's what at least I think limits me in my mind and I don't know if others have ideas as to how you could create the strong affinity between I mean we all recognize that it's an apolar molecule relative to CO2, but is there what would what is a creative way to create a let's say strong chemical bond between um a site on a surface and and methane.",

They do require high pressures, but you could I guess I'm thinking about embedding a catalyst site inside of an artificial clathrate essentially, the methane wants to come into class in clathrate there and then it gets you've got a very strong oxidizing source, you do H atom extraction, oxidize it. Um that's a lot of complex architecture to put together. Um but I don't know uh you know, that's one thought. I guess you're totally right. Otherwise, what intermolecular forces does methane like to do nothing really. It it's crappy at Vander walls interactions, it's crappy at any kind of dispersion interactions, but at least it does like to to form this perfect little pocket of oxygens and hydrogens and sit in there nicely. So I don't know if we can take advantage of that as a trick to get it to bind actually with some affinity at least.",

So it's uh and then I did the quantum mechanics and all that. And so what I learned from there is that Vander walls is not so bad after all uh especially for methane. Um still not polar um but when I did all this very high um start level stuff um and uh in in in cough. So so so you get some of it uh from the Vander walls, but also the mechanism on the nanopores actually changes, right? So instead of doing layer by layer because of the nanoconfinement, um you get a a lot of thermodynamics from there. So what you were saying Phillip about the the caltrates being just designed for that size is super important if not essential because you overlap the the the things.",
