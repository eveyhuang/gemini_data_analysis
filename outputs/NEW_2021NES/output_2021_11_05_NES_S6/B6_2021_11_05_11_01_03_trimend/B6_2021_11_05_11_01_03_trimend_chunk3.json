So those kind of things, but I think the varies, the issue is the varies a bit um from let's say PPM level or less than PPM to hundreds of PPM, which is much higher than the ambient um methane concentration. So I think it's not considered a point source because it's already diffused. If it's if the cows is inside a building or inside a barn but then you can essentially take the exhaust and consider that as a point source, but actually when it's in open land, you still have a PPM level of this methane, which is much higher than the conventional the the the base level in the atmosphere. So how to capture those dilute methane gas and that will be a resource for the farm.",

Um and so you know the discussion at least from some experimentalists who are trying to develop absorbents or zeolite based absorbents for methane is to try to to collect them at point sources um just because there is no I would say uh reliable chemistries that could effectively remove methane out of the very dilute streams. It's just a nonpolar molecule. It likes being single. So that's also a difficulty as well.",

Another thing we haven't talked about is coal mines because methane is um emitting from coal mines. relevant to people the um talking about. And uh and it maybe it's relevant to what we are doing. we are trying to see what's the limit about methane um lowest concentration methane can do and I think recently there's other people trying using platinum based reactivity based capture. Um they sell it as a methane based sensor but it's uh it's indeed it is a way to capture relative low methane concentration, but I agree with the floor it's uh it it's a pretty inert molecule.",

            "transcript": "Given the the dilution and the inertness of the molecule um it seems like another useful approach could be to have something that just oxidizes the methane to CO2 maybe even integrated into some kind of air capture process. Um you know the the challenge is is getting that to happen at at room temperature or you know temperatures where you would be doing typical absorption and desorption. Like it's usually got to be quite a bit hotter and we don't want to be putting that kind of heat into higher atmosphere. Well Adam, I think what could be done, I mean this is a kind of aggressive geoengineering approach is um one could make volatile catalysts that go up in the atmosphere and with UV light oxidize the the methane to CO2 and then we fix the CO2 on earth. Yeah, potentially. I was or or even maybe rather than catalyst something like generating extra ozone but like up in the stratosphere where it wouldn't be because it's actually not good for people that to have it down in the you know the the layers of the atmosphere what we're breathing, but but basically more radical creation up in the upper atmosphere. Some kind of solar powered plasma discharging thing on weather balloons or I don't know.",
