And uh this is uh not so common uh spectroscopy compared UVs infrared and chemical we use. Uh seems this technique can be uh useful to gain additional information about the uh you know catalytic process and the chemical process for CO2 reduction. And another thing we discussed about the in situ operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy, uh emission spectroscopy. And the channel is uh if we want to to track the reaction intermediate for CO2 reduction. So at the moment it's hard to do uh carbon K edge measurement, okay. And um for uh further understanding, we think uh you know, you know, computational uh modeling are very important, machine learning and which is popular and AI are popular too popular too at the moment. So they can provide opportunity to uh for automatic data process data analysis and which can help us uh to uh understand and better understand our experiment data and to train uh the data uh which can eventually help us to design better catalyst and to improve improve the uh you know operation condition and uh you know chemical process. Okay. And uh I think another thing is about we we need uh more study computational study to understand the CC band formation. If you want to make C2 above product from CO2. Yeah. I think that's uh face summary from our discussion. Maybe Mike and someone else can can chime in.",

            "transcript": "Um, so you know, one of the pervasive themes that we had through our discussion was in terms of mechanisms of electrochemical CO2 reduction, do we even need to know the mechanism? And and this discussion was came out of um how the chemical process industry has developed prior to this with a lot of Edison type experiments where they build things and maybe do a kind of um high throughput or some kind of screening at a relevant industrial scale to find operational conditions or not. And so it's an open question of do we first need to understand mechanisms at an atomic lab scale. Um, and then if those do translate, um, we need to make that translation clear because both computationally and experimentally, um looking at mechanisms are typically done on well defined surfaces or well defined systems with, you know, probably not a lot of flow or or or um mass transport, but if we look at what this technology would potentially need to be at a high TRL, um probably the conditions would be very, very different and the mechanisms would probably change. And this has implications for both the materials, so materials durability, um and selectivity requirements changing as a function of operation conditions, um degradation modes will probably be different, you know, flooding happens at at larger scales and salt formations which may not need to be dealt with at the lab scale. So, um, it's the kind of the two prong question of do we need to wait or even to say do we even have the time to wait and look at this from the atomic scale up and take every step there, or can we learn from some of the previous chemical process industry to see um we need kind of the large scale testing and assessment there to feed the relevant conditions into the the fundamental science. So we recognize the need for both the applied and fundamental work, but I think one of the key messages is that we need that feedback loop to be much quicker and more direct and lean on what's been done with with other even electrochemical technologies. Um, you know, looking at what kind of characterization, I think we all agree and with the other group as well that operando and in situ characterization is absolutely necessary. Um, you know, doing ex situ work and looking at sites afterwards, there may be reconstruction um or or changes that are not due to the catalysis. So, um getting good time spatial energetic resolution on various operando techniques is necessary. Um, we briefly did talk about CO2 reduction uh and saying that you know, copper is a great material but it can't do it all uh or it can't do it all very good. So, um either looking into ways to alloy copper with other materials to steer selectivity or put it in a different local environment um uh with ionomers or electrolytes that could change its selectivity beyond the intrinsic proper properties of copper. Um, and then a lot of discussion with with uh process systems integration life cycle assessment is if we want to site an electrochemical CO2 reduction reactor in a chemical uh process or industry, um, we may need to take use of waste heat from other processes that can help tune certain things. Um, I think the advantage of electrochemistry is flexibility, uh whereas thermochemistry you kind of want to keep it at a steady state. So, um that that's I think the major points uh that came from our room.",

And uh the the thing is that we also need to to probably do experiments in the lab scale in a in a in a in a system that is actually relevant to to any scale up or industrialization. So as part of the first year of the, we have developed a gas tight rotating cylinder electrode cell where we put the model uh copper poly copper electrode and we rotate it at different uh rates. And as you rotate it, even though you have the same potential, you actually start to see dramatic changes in in selectivity. We already uh also we have the preprint in in our website. So what we see is that actually mass transport control selectivity and the the the problem is a little bit more complex. So you actually have a lot of uh CO that is the main reaction intermediate that dissolves and hangs around near the surface of the electrode long enough. So at the near the surface of the electrode it actually behaves as a sort of CSTR a continuous stirred tank reactor and then uh what happens is that we get a lot of high uh conversion of CO and uh theory is trying to do a lot of mechanistic understanding of of those systems actually on under high uh conversion of CO and uh typically you don't study kinetics under under those conditions, right? Uh but now that I think we have a good uh system, right? Uh uh",
