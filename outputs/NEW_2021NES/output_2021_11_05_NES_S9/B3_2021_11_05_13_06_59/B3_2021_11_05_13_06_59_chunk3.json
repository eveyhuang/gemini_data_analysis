But anyway, um electro fuel project was can you have bugs without having um photosynthetic route, can you make biomass using electrons. So basically you have like for example iron, right? And changing their oxidation state, can you feed that biological system to make fuel.",

Like they were even looking at the in situ in mind sites. I think that's what they were doing. At least my colleagues at Columbia were doing it that way, Scott. So I remember because if you go there, there's enough ionic species with different oxidation states. So you can use that and they were trying to merge um copper mining or acid mine drainage with uh making biomass, which was kind of interesting. But I haven't heard uh doing anything with the photosynthetic route. But I like these crazy ideas, but I don't think it's that crazy because people start thinking about it. I think there's a lot of interesting happening at the interface of different disciplines, right? Electrochemistry with the biology and whole that other things.",

Uh basically acetate serve as the energy source and the carbon source at the same time. Uh we do have a paper um uh still in the review and moment uh talking about this particular approach. Uh so NASA actually have some interest uh in how to grow food without any um sunlight directly involved. So this is one of the project uh my collaborator actually got founded through NASA.",
