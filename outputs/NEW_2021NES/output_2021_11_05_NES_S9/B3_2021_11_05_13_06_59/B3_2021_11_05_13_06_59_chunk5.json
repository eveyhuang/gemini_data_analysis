So so there's definitely like this opportunity to do process intensification and add value by, you know, oxidizing something that's more valuable than just making O2.

Um, in terms of broad strategies to control the environment, you know, in terms of electrolyte engineering or trying to get local pHs or what have you.

Is this really negative emissions or is this a niche thing that we're all funded for and want to do, but isn't really going to do anything to to the carbon uh balance in the planet or if it is, how is it actually negative emissions?",
