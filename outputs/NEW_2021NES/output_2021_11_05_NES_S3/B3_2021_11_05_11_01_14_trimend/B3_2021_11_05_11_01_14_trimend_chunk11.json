Um, for storage, we talked about CO2 mineralization and some physical phenomena that needed to kind of understand or accelerate that process, um, or better understanding of precipitation and dissolution phenomena, both sort of solid liquid, so at the solid liquid, um, interface when you're, um, sort of forming these sort of solid minerals and at the liquid gas interface when you're actually dissolving CO2 into your liquid, um, sorbent. We also talked about, um, some interesting ideas about mining, coupling mineralization with mining of valuable elements. And then finally we talked about some design criteria to keep in mind when, when thinking about these things. So thermal conductivity, especially if, um, you know, the heats of adsorption and desorption are playing a role in the sorbents, electrical conductivity for the electrochemical materials, transparency, if we're talking about using, uh, light as a trigger, uh, materials that can accommodate self-healing or assisted healing processes, um, and then just taking a lot of knowledge from the catalysis community, um, that they've developed about, um, adsorption and desorption and sort of balancing the energetics of those two processes and to inform the design of materials for, um, I think thinking about sorbents again in this case.

And, um, it seems like we had agreement that maybe point sources would be the best option, however, um, even if we try to, um, develop some sort of technology that can take methane from these point sources, they're actually pretty dilute in terms of they have a lot of variability, um, where you can have a few PPMs of methane to hundreds of PPM, um, for example at agricultural sources.",

So it's leaving the chemistry of methane alone, the molecule, which is naturally nonpolar and then doing something with that, maybe changing the pressure or temperature to try to store it. Um, the second is trying to make it more reactive. And so we talked about the idea of reactive capture. And then the last thing, um, is actually taking inspiration from nature, so using microbes.",

And actually this is a solution that has been, um, starting to develop in Japan and they actually have some technology to do this.
