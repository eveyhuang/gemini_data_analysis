Right so so so basically what I'm trying to see if there's a way to explore plasma catalysis to do both conversion and capture and conversion within active sites of materials.",

We you know we could come back around to the sort of how we can use computational and machine learning or high throughput things or whatever for doing synthesis and characterization. Or the the other thing that we haven't talked about is integration of materials into systems. And you know what do you see as your challenges there. You know sometimes it's are we working on materials that would never have a possibility of being used in a real system for moving towards negative emissions but maybe we're learning things from that that could help us on other materials that would have practical applications. And so so this idea of how to integrate your materials into a real process is this something that you think about or you know I'd like to get your thoughts on this.",

            "timestamp": "02:19-04:02",
            "transcript": "I can maybe comment a little not so much necessarily on direct process integration but more something that has to be considered I guess as part of that that doesn't receive that much attention on materials characterization side which is just thermal conductivity and like managing heat during absorption and desorption processes. Particularly for solid adsorbents but I assume for liquid sorbents as well. And I think particularly when you're thinking about thermal swing type processes for absorbing and desorbing CO2 you're kind of there's intrinsic kind of thermodynamic inefficiencies that are kind of built into what you're doing. So like absorbing CO2 is always going to be exothermic and that's going to heat up your material and when your material gets hot it's going to absorb less CO2 in almost every case. And so you need to have systems in place to manage those temperature increases during absorption processes. But then you want to put heat into your material to desorb the CO2 so there's kind of an inefficiency there because you're trying to dissipate a bunch of heat just to put a bunch of heat back in. And so there's opportunities to think about how to to deal with that. And the same is true during desorption. Desorption is endothermic so your material gets colder and holds on to CO2 if you're doing a pure thermal swing. And so I think thinking about that is important and then also just there's usually not very much that's understood about thermal conductivity of different types of sorbents and that's a property that's not often measured but is really important in terms of being able to have easier an easier ability to control heat transport and manage temperature fluctuations in any kind of CO2 capture system.",

            "transcript": "I could sort of comment on electrochemical swings. They're not implemented but like I don't think they're implemented commercially but folks are trying to do that. I think two of the big systems level problems that we have or at least maybe device first on the device level is you usually need an electrolyte and a liquid and that if you're bubbling something through you have a lot of mass transfer challenges so I think one of the big challenges of actually implementing is figuring out ways to do it with a direct gas phase sorbent that has electronic conductivity without the need for a liquid electrolyte. The other big problem is the counter electrode. You often have the one electrode being used for CO2 capture and then the counter electrode usually is very inefficient and it's often getting destroying something so optimizing the counter electrode is also one of the problems. So one way that folks have come up with systems is one electrode is absorbing and the other one is releasing in some sort of swing system that's symmetric so that was perhaps one of some of the challenges there.",

            "transcript": "I think in general just like the connection between what we do on a lab scale and like a on the fundamental level even just synthesis wise but also like the characterization and and testing compared to something that's on a more application scale like when you're making like a lab scale device versus an application scale device are are you going to get the same performance metrics or when you scale up your synthesis is it going to make you know is it going to work as well as as the lab scale. So I think translating from lab scale to a more application scale there's a lot of of challenges or things might not go the same way. So that's something.",

So you are talking about scaling up right now right so how you are going to put your material. I think I heard what Katie was saying yes it's true sometimes to scale up it's from micro to big scale it's crazy. But for sure there are first step that we have to think about there are bench scale and then there is the prototype and then we can scale up. So there are different phase that you can go through and I mean I'm a process engineer as a background. You will find out the way in order to put your best material because I'm not a material science so I'm always relying on material on people that works on the material and say hey is it going to work okay I will figure out how to do how to put this material in our system absorption desorption temperature swing pressure swing. I also heard humidity swing if I well understood. So there will be way to brainstorm how to how to put this material in order that is going to work and in order that is not going to lose efficiency. And for sure there are other parameter that we are not considering.",
