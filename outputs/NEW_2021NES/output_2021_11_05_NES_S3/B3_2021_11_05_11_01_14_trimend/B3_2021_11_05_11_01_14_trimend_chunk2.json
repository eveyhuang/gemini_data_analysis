            "transcript": "And so I'm thinking of levitation in terms of the mechanics of materials. Um so for example, I could elaborate a bit on the mechanics aspects. So for example, when it's related to either of the three processes mentioned, separation, sorption or storage, uh there's fundamental properties, mechanical properties of the material that's changing. For example, certain absorption of gases leads to some of these materials becoming brittle. Some of the absorption can result in volume changes and all of this affects material reversibility and fatigue. Um so that's one thing that I could see as a limitation of current materials, but of course there are challenges on the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects as well, but um that's how I'm looking at this problem.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I I think I can talk a little bit about that as well. Uh uh since uh uh I bring out the mechanics and nano mechanics kind of uh you know, topics. A lot of these materials are very, very heterogeneous materials and you know, if you look at the materials at a very small length scale, they're all different in the you know, between the neighboring domains and they have different uh phase distribution and mechanical mechanical effect coming out of that as well. And that really brings up the the challenges for how do we properly categorize this kind of materials. Uh categorizing materials in a very heterogeneous system without knowing how to characterize the material, we might not be able to establish the the true relationship between the properties and and the synthesis. And the other thing is that the the the computational efforts, right? We now at the point that we can predict so many things and there was a very interesting article on chemistry of materials a few uh a few weeks ago about predictive synthesis. So we can predict synthesis using computer, but if you look into those kind of predictions very, very closely, sometimes they even violate the very basic kinetic or even thermodynamic laws. Um and we need to have experimental verification of the theoretical studies. But at this point, either the performance testing or the materials characterization are much slower than the rate of computation. So we need to have um advanced tools that can categorize materials that can measure performance at a much faster rate. Meanwhile, we need to use more advanced data analytic analytical methods, uh not just conventional data analysis, you need to have, you know, machine learning or that kind of capability to to do large scale data analysis for experimental results and then they can couple with high throughput theoretical prediction. I think that's a lot of gap right now between what can be synthesized and what is predicted.",

Yeah, I think this is a really interesting idea of, you know, that we could screen, we can screen materials uh computationally and we can do that relatively fast. Uh making and screening materials experimentally certainly has more challenges to it and uh so I'd be interested in uh any of your thoughts or ideas or things that you've done that have worked to advance that um uh higher throughput um synthesis and and testing of materials experimentally.",

But we have not done yet high throughput synthesis. I think that's something a lot of people are doing right now. How to, you know, use robotics to to synthesize materials, for example. Uh that would be a great way to go. Yeah, and also there's uh some quite of hesitation from I'm an experimentalist. I'm sometimes I'm hesitating to take what my colleagues predict and ask my students to synthesize them. Uh you know, often times you can spend, you know, months, sometimes even years to synthesize something that's even, you know, almost impossible, right? So I think that's that's that's put the stopper for me to really actively uh pursuing collaboration with some prediction.",

Uh for some of the polymer absorbents is even harder. I think the synthesis takes much longer. So uh I was approached about doing some high throughput on some of the types of polymer materials that we have and one of the limitations is actually doing the absorption tests. If you're doing it like a like a well-defined thermal absorption it's maybe easier than doing an electrochemical absorption. So I think uh one of the main uh challenges for some of these types of materials is finding some sort of test that can infer the final absorption without actually going and doing it. So if there's some sort of midway interaction that we can collect a lot of data uh because they said we need this amount of data and we are two orders of magnitude less in terms of the materials that we can actually be useful for their training set. So I thought that was one of the challenges. Um and then one of the other challenges I thought that a lot of the computational screening is being used for affinity of the CO2 um and the selectivity, but I think it'd be nice if the computational chemistry folks could develop also stability tests uh instead of just equilibrium equilibrium binding, they could also develop high throughput kinetic um tests somehow that they can say uh screen out things that won't be stable because if we do that experimentally it's going to be so much work.",
