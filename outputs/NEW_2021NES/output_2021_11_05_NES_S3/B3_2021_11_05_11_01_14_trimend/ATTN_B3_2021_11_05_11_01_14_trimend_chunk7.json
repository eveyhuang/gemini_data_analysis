So challenges, so one of the things we kind of talked about a lot was um sort of these gaps between computational predictions and experiments, synthesis takes time. Uh predicted structures may not actually be synthetically accessible. So basically like, you know, so we've all these machine learning things are great, but like actually keeping it connected to what experimentalists are actually can do on a reasonable time scale. We also have the gap between lab scale and application scale. Um and then these degradation processes I think we were talking about towards the end. So these reversibility cyclability issues, the fact that many of these I think particularly in the the sorbents function at sort of these non equilibrium conditions. Like this part of how they work is that you know, you're you're you're you're changing um their operating conditions and then does that contribute to these degradation processes. Um I don't know if there's more here to add.",
