So when it's synthesized, there's usually something filling in the pores and that's why that's the thermodynamically favored product from the synthesis, but then then in an application there's no longer a solvent molecule or something like that templating the pores and so it's it's kinetically um meta stable.",

Um, but maybe rather than like self-healing, some type of assisted healing is like a a better thing to kind of think about at least in the context of porous materials where you do something periodically, um, kind of like zeolites that are used for like hydrocarbon cracking reactions, right? every so many cycles they get heated up really hot to burn off all the carbon junk that's just accumulated on them.",

And so um there's a lot of uh flow through electrodes that have been used in batteries and stuff and they be used now for desalination. I think we sort of co opportunity to explore um these sort of um absorptive materials in electrochem for uh CO2 capture. I don't think these have been looked at uh too much.
