            "transcript": "I was wondering if we could think about it the other way. Can we optimize maybe the types of amines that we would use either just mixed in a liquid system or tethered on a surface, um, similar to photocatalysts where they found actually that having amines tethered on photocatalytic, um, responsive particles helps to activate the CO2 and now you have this carbamate molecule, um, which you can actually make into much more interesting products. So I was going down the trail of this chemical synthesis. Okay, but now we just said maybe thinking about scale chemical synthesis is not truly negative emissions based on the amount of CO2 that has to come out versus the chemicals we use. So I was trying to think, okay, maybe as a question, what should we make? Should we be making blocks of carbon coal and we're going to rebury that or are we interested in carbon composites and new building materials? Is that something that's at sufficient scale, um, to be called negative emissions. ",

But then the source of whatever is going to be the alkalinity that forms the carbonate is always the the major issue. But I think um in some ways the the scale of what we need to do is so staggering, whether it's, you know, even batteries for electrification or scaling up capture systems. I think the materials intensity is something that we will have to reckon with in a really hard way no matter what the solution, uh even if it's solid sorbents, liquid sorbents, there's no way to get around it.",

But when we are talking about, I think Jen was talking about a little bit too that we are not looking at the technology we're going to deploy within 10 years. We are, but that's not the only thing. We are talking about decarbonization and climate change mitigation at 2100, right? So the technology we're going to deploy in 2050 even, we may not have it now, right? Because it takes assuming it takes about two decades to commercialize from your idea. It's a far off, which means that we really need to work on the fundamental science and engineering for the future technology which we're going to develop. So be open minded in my opinion and uh ultimately best carbon management is do not take fossil carbon out of the ground, period, right?
