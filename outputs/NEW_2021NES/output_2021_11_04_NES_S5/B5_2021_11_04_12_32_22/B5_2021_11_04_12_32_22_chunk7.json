But there are there are definitely some disadvantages of these systems like like the stability issues, etc. Okay, so because, you know, for for molecular systems, uh the the the atoms are linked not always by very strong bonds, but sometimes very labile bonds have to be used. So under pretty harsh conditions, especially when there is a heat, where when when there is um quite high or low potentials applied, these bonds might tend to break causing stability issue. Yeah. So there's there's always a trade trade off for for for a system.",

And like instead, it's almost like extraction, right? So you need to mix this air quite a bit, not only finding reducing power. So we have to design even materials how to increase the feature area, all those things. Much more challenging, but interesting at the same time.",

            "transcript": "One of the things we haven't talked about yet that I'll throw out there in case you're interested is um if you imagine a future where we are going to have to pipeline CO2 because we're doing CO2 capture from point sources, um industry, air, etc. There's certain specifications that are required for purity of the gases to go into pipeline. And actually the the the one of the more difficult ones to meet is an oxygen purity. So probably the least discussed but still important separation related to DAC is because you're capturing from such an oxygen rich stream that even if you have very good selectivity to CO2 and you minimize the amount of energy to do the separation and everything looks good, you tend to capture a not insubstantial amount of oxygen as well and quite often you can't hit the pipeline specs for oxygen. So for those of you who design absorbent materials, um CO2 water is a really important selectivity and then CO2 oxygen is probably the next most important one, but it's one that so far not many people talk about.",

So if uh we want to get rid of oxygen, maybe that's an argument for the oxygen reaction being beneficial to CO2 capture. I'm not sure, but if you are at the same time electro reducing oxygen, you're really diminishing its concentration. People normally consider that a bad thing, but if you want to spec that is uh CO2 pure, maybe that's a good thing. So you want to have oxygen reduction catalyst together with a CO2 capture binding site. I'm not sure if that's uh I'm not sure if the water that it makes or whatever it makes, if that's good, maybe it could be just as bad, but",
