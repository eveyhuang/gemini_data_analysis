So we we uh so what we do is uh in a in a fundamental level, we we like to uh develop models at the continuum lens scale, so which are microns or you know, hundreds of nanometers and size. And at the very fundamental level, we plug in a bunch of partial differential equations, which for example could be describing the thermal stability of your system or it could be describing a diffusion process in your system or it could be also describing a stress relaxation in your material system and and what we do is we then build these models to help us predict and understand for example, uh how absorption process for example occurs at the fundamental lens scale or how does nucleation of microstructures take place in fat and crystalline materials and then link how how the evolution at a few microns lens scale affects properties which could be related to mechanical strength, it could be related to energy conversion, could be related to energy storage. So that's so that's the kind of fundamental framework we develop. We've looked at uh materials that are used for batteries. We looked at a bunch of functional materials and we are in the moment building a model to understand uh absorption and grain boundaries and things like that. Yeah.",

So few things the Department of Energy is suggesting is you need to have a minimum pressure drop because you can't really compress entire air to push it through the reactor, right? So minimum pressure drop. Uh you don't target 90, 95% CO2 capture. This is almost impossible. So I think a target is usually 60%. I think that's the least number I saw correct me if I'm correct. And uh the last one one of the things is the other impurities. So like uh in the point source capture there's not much oxygen, but in air we have 21% oxygen. So oxidative degradation of materials would be a lot faster and you have some rainy days, so fluctuating humidity, there will be particle that fine particles dust going around other things like VOCs. If you look at the 400 ppm versus other impurities, they can be quite comparable. So you have to really think about all those challenges. So very different system in my opinion.",

So you want to achieve you know, the high typically the the highest air velocity you can without having to move to compressors. There are startup companies that are totally passive though. Uh there are projects here, Arizona State and other places where um if you get to a suitable height above the ground, the average wind speed is already very similar to what you would have um from fans. So there there there are people who are approaching that as well. And coming back to Alissa's prior answer about what makes it different from a conventional carbon capture in chemical engineering terms, um you should think of direct air capture as an extraction whereas the um point source capture is typically a purification where you're you're held to recover as much of the CO2 as you can whereas uh you use the amount that you recover from air as an additional optimization variable um and operate as an extraction. And typically that leads to 50 to 75% removal as uh sort of an optimal that a lot of the current startups have found.",
