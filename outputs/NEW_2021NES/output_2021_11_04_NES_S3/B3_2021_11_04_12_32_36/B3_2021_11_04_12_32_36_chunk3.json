So if I think about um operating CO2 and hydrogenating CO2 um essentially to a liquid fuel like methanol, let's say. Um I think the ratio of methanol to CO uh at least if you carry out the thermodynamic calculations tends to favor um a product like CO significantly and in terms of the thermal catalysis approaches I haven't seen all that many catalysts that at low CO2 pressures can uh produce methanol with at sufficient selectivities and I don't know if there's an approach to do uh steering selectivity towards methanol uh using electro and or photocatalysis that would uh not be accessible let's say using thermal catalysis but that's just uh a thought that comes to mind.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, so so there's a lot of cases where particularly if you can drive something with like coupled proton electron transfer or or like hydroxyl addition to do either reductions or or oxidations uh from from from water say, uh you can get different selectivity uh you can push one route relative to another um in a way that you wouldn't get thermally because when you heat things up other pathways are also activated. So like a hydrogen, you can speed up the relative rate of a hydrogenation to a CC bond cleavage that wouldn't directly be influenced by the the potential or maybe only in a very kind of indirect way by the field or something. Um so so you can definitely get selectivity enhancements but then there's there's trade offs with that because then you can get like parasitic hydrogen evolution instead of the the hydrogenation you're trying to carry out. So there's there's pros and cons and then the question is like can I design the catalyst to have a high enough faradaic efficiency uh you know, to still make the electrochemical pathway favorable.",

Uh I think from the perspective of molecular catalysis, I think we now understand that tuning the electronics of the catalyst is a pretty uh easy and and well understood way to change turnover frequencies. Um so you know, adding let's say electron donating or withdrawing groups off of some ligand backbone, um you can scale the activity of a molecular catalyst in this way. Um so I think more broadly speaking, maybe the thermodynamics of uh various catalysts is is where there's a lot of emphasis. I haven't seen quite as much on trying to understand uh how design of catalysts affects their kinetics.",

But what I heard him saying about the transport what you're saying right now is that kind of interconnection of not just thinking about the design or the chemistry of it per se, but how you're putting it into a system and how that affects like you're saying the local conditions. So I think that interplay between the two um is critical too. It's just my thought.",

            "transcript": "Oh no, sorry, I just missed the first part that maybe was more engaging and someone knocked my door so I apologize for that. Um but I'm just hearing few things about thinking out of the box. I mean my research is as I said is focused on catalysis and separation at the same time. So what you can do with catalysis, yes, we can increase the selectivity but then we will have some trade off and what I'm doing right now is doing the reaction and just separating what product of the reaction in the same time that the reaction is taking place. So I'm going since it's an open system.",

            "transcript": "And I apologize if I'm going to offend someone with this word but we are going to overcome the thermodynamic equilibrium. Some most of the times I was like, Simona, we can, you're going to violate the second level of thermodynamics. I was like, yes, because it's just an open system. So as soon as the product is formed, you're going to separate so you're going to push more the production of the second product. So for example, I'm working on a hydrogen production, sure, starting from hydrocarbon, sure. And so we have some um reaction that are thermodynamic constraint as you know, water gas shift reaction or meeting steam reforming reaction. Sure, they're coming from fossil fuel but could be any kind of other hydrocarbon. And as soon as the reaction is taking place, you're going to form CO2 and hydrogen. Hydrogen is separated. So the reaction is moved forwards to more you know, um react react products formation. And so you can create two streams at the end, one that is pure hydrogen and the second one that is pure CO2 and with CO2 you can do whatever you want because because it's also at high pressure. So designing a catalyst, yes, but I believe is not the designing of the catalyst. We have also to think about the overall box and say, okay, we can do something more on that one because I was thinking, okay, I can improve, I can improve like you know, the efficiency of the catalyst, okay, bigger surface area, how can I spread out, you know, we have always the same material and how can I spread out all the active catalyst on that material, it's amazing. But then we have to think just a little bit, I believe one step as I said out of the box.",

            "transcript": "If I might add um and and build on what uh Simona just said is there are a lot of different ways that um you're not violating thermodynamics versus second law but you can steer the reactions and so separating off products as they're formed is one very uh powerful design principle. We just got a new proposal doing that. Um and but another one and this comes to something Fic said, I believe Fic said it. Um when you have a really deeply endothermic reaction um so like water splitting if you just did thermolysis, it's an impractically high temperature but you can break it into multiple reactions uh at lower temperatures for various trade offs. So it's second design principle to push you maybe uh to out of the box to think in terms of is how do you sort of split one reaction that might be really hard sometimes into multiple reactions that are easier and can be manipulated uh differently and also get your separations like uh splitting water, the oxygen and hydrogen happening in two different reactions. So those are just want to throw that in for you to think about.",

So that's been a goal of chemist for a very long time.",
