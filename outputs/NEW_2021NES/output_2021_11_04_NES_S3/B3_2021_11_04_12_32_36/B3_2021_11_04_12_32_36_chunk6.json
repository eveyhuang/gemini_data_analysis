Um it's interesting that I didn't hear any controversy about, you know, thermochemistry is no longer good with, you know, we need to throw it out and, you know, everything is electro or photochemistry now because it has to be clean. So I see a lot of building on top of each other, uh but you're also making your own problems more complicated because now you're, I mean you have to worry about multiple you were complaining about having to deal with 10 parameters and now you combine two different um, you know, processes and now you have 20 parameters and I'm according to Eva maybe be coupled. So what are you going to do about all that?",

Usually, if you take two systems and combine them together, if they're not sort of well thought out, it's just kind of bad at both things, right? Um, the nice thing about having sort of multiple unit operations um in order related to one another is you can independently optimize and size each of them, right? Um, in many cases, you know, when you just to give you an example like the relative rates of each of those processes in sort of a multi-step system, ultimately the the slow step that will determine how fast the process goes. And so sometimes if let's say you can break out the slow step into a different reactor, just make that one way bigger, right? And then you can drive whatever process you need, but if it's all in the same reactor, you're kind of stuck at that slow step. You're right, Jordi, um, you know, there now you're making two reactors instead of one. Um, and there's different optimizations that can be done there, but um, you know, there's value in in doing that in terms of optimization.",

Um but I think there are some systems where the some of the parts uh does not equal the sum of the whole. Uh and so I think it may be interesting to consider how do we identify those types of systems? Like how can we uh plan or or uh anticipate situations where a combination of different strategies together is actually going to be much more beneficial than just sort of smooshing uh components that each do their own part together and hoping for something that ultimately will be probably worse than if we did each one independently.

Uh I think a lot of process intensification efforts have aimed at coupling catalysis and separations where the catalysis piece proceeds the separation piece of the puzzle as an typical chemical plant, but here you're looking to couple a catalytic process with a separation process where the catalytic process is downstream of the separation process as opposed to more traditional process intensification efforts. So, uh I haven't in my mind, I mean I've read papers, many papers about these integrated approaches, but in my mind I haven't seen the specific advantage of having a single step capture and conversion process especially direct air capture and conversion process articulated. At least I haven't seen that articulated well. So, I'm sorry I'm just pointing out shortcomings for the most part and not uh not providing any answers here.",

There was an early on conversation that you guys were having that I don't think that thread was pulled on um entirely, which is, you know, there are a lot of different ways to, you know, inject the energy if you will and steer the reactions. Um, the the question was asked, how do we know, you know, which one to use, you know, use a, you know, electrochemical force or use a thermal force or um, whatever, um, pressure, um, is another one I suppose. The the conversation kind of got dropped as to, you know, and then, you know, maybe you can combine them all uh in different ways and different parts, you know, like Fick was saying, you know, uh in doing react, you know, reactions here in one reactor and in another reactor is are there some design principles uh that would help you think through which force to use to to help steer the unit operation.",

Uh so so I've thought about this exact thing a little bit and I I I think the framework to me um would be to start so so I think we're going to assume that we're getting electricity and we're like this is our starting point. We're trying to move away from you know, coal fired or or whatever process we're using to get to the electricity. So say you start with electricity, the question is then should I pump that directly into a process or could I turn that into heat and use heat? And the the Praveen asked for something articulate. I'm I'm going to be very inarticulate because I haven't completely thought this through but but you know, you can always turn the electricity into heat for basically unit efficiency. Um, I think in some cases if you're not trying to drive against too large of a gradient that the electricity might be most effectively used for pumping heat because you can do that at higher efficiency than just turning it directly into heat, but then there's some auxiliary hardware and and maybe, you know, the actual don't work out. But but the framework I would always think in terms of is I have this many units of electrical energy, is it better to pump them directly into the process or to siphon some off to to pump heat in or turn them into heat and with with that process do any better.",

To a process design and all of these one can be combined together in terms of process intensification and I I agree with Adam that says, okay, you can transform electricity to heat and we can use electrochemistry and then thermochemical. But all the time we have also to think about is it worth it and what is the what are our constraint and what could be the best. So direct air capture, I believe that is working as it is because it's already commercialized.",
