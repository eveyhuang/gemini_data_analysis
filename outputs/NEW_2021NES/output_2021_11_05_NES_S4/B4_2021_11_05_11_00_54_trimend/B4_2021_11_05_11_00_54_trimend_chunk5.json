            "transcript": "Hello, thanks. Uh so I have a few points I wanted to mention uh just in in response to a lot of these comments. Uh the first is that I've heard a lot of discussion about uh you know, development of the catalyst. Uh but I think we've also learned that the reaction conditions can be just as important if not more important. And so I would be really interested, you know, to maybe map that space out much more in depth than it has been mapped out. Um you know, all of these sort of high throughput screens of different metal alloys or different ways to excuse me, combine uh materials to make the electro catalyst are useful for sure. Uh but but I think we need um larger screens as well of, you know, ions that are present or of the electrolyte of the solvent of all of the different reaction conditions that go into this. Um so so that's one thing. Um and then to the provocative statement of whether we really need mechanistic information. Um I'm not excited to say this, but I think maybe I would I would hazard a guess and say no, not always. Um because as you pointed out in in the chemical industry a lot of times I think those conditions had been uh determined just based on a large number of experimental uh attempts, right? And then people found what worked the best. So maybe that's what we need in this case as well just as Charles mentioned determine a system that will uh be potentially practically useful and then try a lot of these high throughput screens uh there and whether or not we completely understand everything uh on a mechanistic level may not matter uh given the time scale we need to make these changes.",

            "transcript": "Um is with regard to operando spectroscopy. Um and the fact that uh it's it's awesome as Wilson pointed out that we can look at ensembles of of intermediates for example or of species on surfaces, but most of the time that's done under steady state conditions. And so I think it's really limiting our ability, you know, it's nice to make claims that this is useful and and I think it definitely is useful in part, but uh those are not short-lived intermediates and you don't get kinetic information by doing things at steady state.",

I think um the the last one is is in fact critical that usually what you can actually see is not is could be a bystander and um we need things that are able to look at very short-lived intermediates. Uh and that's that's just a much more challenging problem. It doesn't, you know, it's it's it's something that certainly has been tackled in the gas phase and and uh and you know, should be tackled in the condensed phase as well ultimately. Um and and uh I think you're I was trying to think you're what was your second point? I was also really um happy about your second point too. Can you remind me?",

So it's it was a very crude way of doing, you know, high throughput screening back then and that's how they optimized uh conditions.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, but I think, you know, one thing that can that we can apply on everything, especially computationally kind of is the comment. Like you've all a lot of you have commented on the high throughput studies, right? They can only take us that far, but then to actually include all of that complexity that we're talking about is truly needed. That is where the actual development on the computational side is needed. So we are still lacking a lot of the computational tools for those for us to study those processes. So there's like a big big opportunity within those spaces as well. I mean, we've talked about the development of experimental tools, but it's just as equally important, I think to develop some of the computational tools, especially if they're fast enough to study some of these some of these processes that we're talking about. But it the question in the end that I find the most well, among the more interesting one is, what is the level of complexity that a computational system or a model system needs to have for me to be able to represent in quotation mark real real system. And I don't know the answer because as you as you pointed out, Eva, it's it's a question of how do all of those local effects, those local environments, the operating conditions, how are they actually changing at given system? And we don't know the answer to that. So it kind of to have that computational prediction, we need to have some kind of a benchmark with at least one system experimentally. So having that first step, I think is I mean there are groups that are working on this, of course. So I I'm I think that there'll be a lot of really interesting things coming out, but how can we do this faster is the other thing that is of course the the clock is ticking. Um but it just coming back to the short-lived intermediates was one one thing that I wanted to mention. I mean, there are there are tools. I mean, the a lot of the national labs are having x-ray capabilities and some of them are developing tools to probe some of these short-lived species in aqueous environments actually. So I think that is something that is really, really cool if we can really uh truly get get to that at some point. Um um any other thoughts? What else have did you jot down that we might not have covered so far or any comments on what anybody else has said so far? Wilson, I think Ashleigh, go ahead.",

Um but I just wanted to say that, you know, I I'm coming from a UHV background and so I have these similar questions as obviously what's come up today is, you know, it's so far removed from the real systems. So, you know, what kind of contributions can model systems add to better understanding active sites. And it's been touched on a bit that um Alex how you just mentioned there are some national labs that are doing um not not only um experiments in aqueous solutions but also in an electrochemical cell. I just saw a talk out of Lund University and I'm like, I don't know how in the world they were able to accomplish this what uh complex next slide. Yeah.",
