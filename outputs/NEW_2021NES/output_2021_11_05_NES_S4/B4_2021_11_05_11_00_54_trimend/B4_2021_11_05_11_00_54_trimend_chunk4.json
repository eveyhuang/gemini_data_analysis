            "transcript": "discussed in the in the previous conferences. I think a mechanism is is is really needed uh not just because we're living on this but also because figuring out a mechanism as Emily mentioned is very important to decide the red limiting step which is really the limiting factor that suppresses uh the the high activity of a catalyst, right? And I totally agree that a mechanism is really hard to confirm but much easier to disprove, right? But the thing is if if we can propose uh several mechanisms and then we disprove as many as possible then at least we can narrow down the possible catalytic pathways.",

Talking about the test bed, I I I totally agree with Charles that a test bed is needed but it's probably very hard to figure out one single test bed that people who work on different scales are happy about. It's probably to figure out several test bed in different at at different scales, you know, so that people who work on fundamental science can have one test bed who work on the small scale industrial uh scale can have another etc. So uh that's my two points on this.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, hi. Not trying to change the topic, but I was trying to look think of more of a from a material perspective. So for instance, I understand that copper or some other good metals are very good at uh, you know, doing a job of an electrode or an electro catalyst if you will for some of these reactions. Is there any opportunity? This is again, I don't know know some of these things. Is there any opportunity to explore newer materials? Let's say oxide heterostructures. I have seen oxides having a lot of different kind of properties. Are we uh already fixed on okay, this is the material we are going to use and somehow try to fashion or you know, maybe the kinetics are better or the reaction, you know, rates are better or there is opportunity to also look at novel materials that could achieve something similar or maybe at a faster rate or is there something there? That's I do not know that. Just so I mean, I have not directly done work on CO2 on but I know a lot of copper 111 surfaces, I believe cobalt, they are all good candidates, but I do not know if other opportunities lie.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, and just adding to that because copper does some things very well. Others other metals, like all metals almost can have some kind of a product distribution starting with CO2. The question is what is the ultimate product that we're interested in, right? So if our target is to make something else that that what what copper is doing, maybe there are other opportunities as well in in terms of actually looking at other materials. So just just keeping that in mind, I think it's something that the community is really targeting a lot finding something that can replace or improve copper for that specific purpose to do the exact chemistry that copper is able to do. But if we're interested in making, I don't know, I'm just going to take something out of the air, you know, um a hydrocarbon instead, not that we would want that, but just as an example, there are other alternatives, right? So just just bringing that up that from a mechanistic point of view, I think that uh there are a lot of opportunities as well.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, um so with regards to like materials discovery, was that kind of brought up, right? Um a goal of actually understanding the reaction mechanisms would be you have to actually you you have a basis for pursuing some sort of rational materials design. Um but the problem especially with like true materials or heterogeneous catalysts is that you're not dealing with a defined catalyst structure, right? You're dealing with at a practical level millions of independent little structures in the system at an interface that are driving a reaction, will have different binding energies, will have different performances and stuff. So to me that starts to become more of an experimental challenge of how you actually differentiate what's going on within those types of complex interfaces. So something that I would just kind of point out and ask is like if there was a holy grail type experiment that you could perform to understand really and probe and test some of these different reaction mechanisms experimentally, um what would it be? And what would you actually need to do? Do you have to get down to probing individual reactive sites at an interface or what?",

            "transcript": "We can do a lot of this with um vibrationalscopy. So you know, infraredscopy can give us information about absorbates and concentrations of species, ionic species close to the surface and then Raman spectroscopy can give us um I think more to what you're talking about Caleb is the vibrational modes that include the metal surface with the absorbates. So a combination of thesescopy under operating conditions is is a challenge to be able to do this because you know, you can imagine if you're aqueous system and you're evolving gases, that's going could have interference with with light and transport issues. So it's there's a technical challenge, but um there's a there's a few chemical techniques that can give this quantifiable information.",

But once you go to these heterogenized systems, like in some ways relates to this point you were bringing up earlier about how much does that apply what we know uh for these well defined systems when we go to heterogeneous materials, how do the mechanisms change and how do the rate limiting step change or are the rate limiting steps of catalysis even relevant when you have issues of mass transfer or electron transport or things of that nature, but it's a tough a tough challenge. I'm I'm not sure.",

            "transcript": "Other other comments on the how to probe the heterogeneity of of a heterogeneous catalyst material basically. I mean, ultimately we know that there is one or multiple active sites, right? How they're distributed, how many, where and what they're doing and then their competition with all of the other chemical processes that are taking place is obviously something that is I mean there are very few reactions that that has actually been done where we started with well defined crystals all the way up to something realistic that actually can be put in a real chemical reactor. I mean right the the ammonia synthesis, the N2 reduction comes to to mind, right? Where we actually know what the active site is and it has been proven that even though if you have very complex systems that is still the active site even if they are still in a I mean the active sites tend to be a minority sites um unfortunately. So um just just keeping that in mind. We want a lot of them, but they're still in minority. So we're wasting a lot of material, of course. Um",
