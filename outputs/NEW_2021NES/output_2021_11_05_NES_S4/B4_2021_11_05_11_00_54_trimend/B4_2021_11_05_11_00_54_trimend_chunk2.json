In the group that I led yesterday Ashley was there so and so was Gary. So I thought it would be good to have just one person who would do both because as you're taking notes then you know what you would want to say. On the other hand it was pointed out to me that there is an advantage of having two because you can have the two people confer at the end to make sure that they have extracted what are the main bullet points and if you have a person who's going to be reporting out they're already looking at the notes of the person who's recording all the weeds and then being able to pull out the ideas at a higher level. So it might be better to have two people if we can accomplish that.",

            "transcript": "Sure. One of the things that I've been trying to understand and struggling with that I think we can all benefit from given the urgency and the timeline we need to solve the problem is translating mechanisms in general but here for electrochemical CO2 reduction translating them from a lab scale to where we envision how things will be used at a larger scale. And there's issues with materials durability and functionality and then operational conditions. If we're running either computations or experiments at a really atomic level a lot of the computations are done in vacuum or with little amounts of solvent because it's so computationally intensive to do these things and then we want to be able to translate that to then how does that help us design an electrolyzer that's 100 megawatts or something. And so there's a lot of steps in between and I'm always concerned that a mechanism we find in the lab may not be the same mechanism that will be used for and so kind of closing that loop and there's a value to all of that. We need the basic science to understand the mechanisms but I think we need the input and the boundary conditions that we envision a technology that doesn't exist. We don't have a 100 megawatt electrolyzer to look at durability. We have to learn fast about other fields like fuel cells and electrolyzers water electrolyzers and start to put those boundary conditions and even operational parameters on more fundamental work because the mechanisms will change and I don't think we have the time to figure out a mechanism at one scale take 40 50 years to make that work there. I think we need to close that loop as soon as possible.",

So I just want to bring up one thing that I thought was very informative building off of what you just said and that was so I was in a meeting just a couple of weeks ago actually where the topic was mechanisms of surface reactions. And the chair very provocatively basically opened up and said do we honestly need to know all of the mechanisms at the atomic scale for us to make things to work? Which all of us were a little bit shaken by because that's kind of what we do for a living right. So we of course want to know as you pointed out we really want to know what is happening at the atomic scale but is it actually necessary? So I want to just kind of continue building off of your discussion is it actually necessary of course the chemical industry is out there and a lot of it does not have any or very little understanding of the actual mechanisms. So how this is exactly to your point do we need to know it how do we do the feedback loops and what is the actual knowledge that is necessary?",

It might be better I think to use the heat for the capture process from some of the discussions having the past few days in terms of concentrating CO2 but I think the general idea of process integration is is key because the outlet of one thing is the inlet for another thing and that means",
