So we did a very deep, deep dive in whether for example manganese is in fact a critical raw material or not. So actually the quality of manganese that we would need for us to to use in an in an industrial setting makes it a in fact a critical raw material because there's only one place where you could get it from which is a politically unstable region in Congo. So it was kind of a you know even though it's earth abundant it's not abundant in the quality that one would need to utilize in a technical setting. So I thought I'd share.",

You know carbon dioxide upcycling is a is a big problem of course but there's a lot of of material recovery that one could do cathodically. You know and this isn't known in the in the in the electrochemical and engineering field and the idea we started developing is that we could potentially also induce polymer breakdown with some really clever chemical tuning of the reaction environment. So if you had a soup of many different things that you could recover you could tentatively be doing multiple different kinds of processes if you applied the right potential if you had the right pH.

Yeah so we've got some benchmarking. Yeah that we can put maybe to a separate a separate thing talking about test bed reactors and some issues with benchmarking. Yeah. And I I like the idea there was a lot of discussion about you know not just do we need to know mechanisms can we know mechanisms really but I like the question of do we even need to know them in order to to advance the technology and to me that's still an open question. I think we need both but I I like that as a kind of a provocative way to help other people think about it.
