So we did a very deep, deep dive in uh whether for example, manganese is in fact um a critical raw material or not. So actually um the quality of manganese that we would need for us to to use in an in an industrial setting uh makes it a in fact a critical raw material because there's only one place where you could get it from, which is a a politically unstable region in Congo. So uh it was kind of a you know, even though it's earth abundant, it's it's not abundant in the quality that one would need to um um uh utilize in a technical um uh setting. So, um thought I'd share.",

Um, you know, and this isn't known um in the in in the electrochemical engineering field and um the idea we started uh developing is that we could potentially also induce polymer breakdown uh with some uh really clever uh chemical tuning of the reaction environment. So if you had a soup of many different things that you could recover, you could tentatively be doing multiple different kinds of processes if you applied the right potential, if you had the right pH.
