So essentially you're in the dark because you think that you're looking at the same material but what we see is that mass transport even when you're doing spectroscopy or when you're doing electrochemistry plays a big role on on CO2 to to CO and to further reduced products, right? So multi-scale modeling is is key. But using well-characterized cells I think is is what we found that was really the challenge.",

Like, you know, the same description that Carlos was just mentioning in terms of the differences that we see in performances in terms of electrochemical cells at the bench scale, those challenges are still really real in terms of being able to do in operando characterization at the at the beam lines. So, so I mean, I think for the past four to five years that I I remember very naively saying, yeah, we're going to go and do this brand new group and we're going to do an operando and it's going to be great and we're going to get all sorts of mechanism elucidation through spectroscopy, it will be perfect. I'm this is year five. And we're still figuring out what is the best cell that is going to, well not only the best cell, but also the surface that is going to give us the opportunity to probe that double layer, get the spectroscopy information as well as the product distribution analysis that Carlos is mentioning.",

But but and I think we we've we've sort of tried to promote this heavily last Scialog, the need for essentially do what the battery community has been doing really nicely in the past two to three years, which is benchmarking and sort of, you know, converging, citing, these are the set of, you know, modeling, theory, calculation, experimental work that we need at the most fundamental level and this is going to help guide, you know, laboratories regardless of what your background across the across the world. And I know Charles likes benchmarking, right Charles?",

      "transcript": "I do but but I I'm I get concerned about benchmarking for CO2. So, you know, CO2, especially CO2 reduction and especially electrochemical CO2 reduction, and I will say just as an aside, I think it's worth discussing whether electrochemical CO2 reduction is actually, I mean, I'm funded like all my work from it, so yeah, let's keep doing it, but is it really the most reasonable way of CO2 conversion? But moving away from that and assuming that it's great, you know, the problem that I see is that it's becoming saturated, CO2 reduction is being saturated with groups that publish and say, I have a new catalyst, it's the best ever, here it is. And benchmarking gets away from some of that, but what we saw when we did HER and OER benchmarking is everyone just tweaked their system to meet the new benchmarks and they basically, I mean, we got lots of high surface area nickel foam supported OER catalysts that of course have high activity per geometric area, but then it took a back seat to, I mean, sort of the mechanistic studies took a back seat to that because if you didn't meet certain performance metrics, you couldn't get published. And so there would be no way for you to think about, well this catalyst didn't work as well, here's why it didn't work as well, going back to some of the failure modes. That sort of fell away and I think it really hurt the OER community for several years because there were just so many papers about, well we have the best catalyst, look, it's 200 millivolt overpotential, it's 150 millivolt overpotential based on basically fake metrics because they gamed the system.",

      "transcript": "That's a really, really great point, Charles, and that that that you made. And I think with the HER community, the journals got flooded with just metrics, metrics, metrics, none of which are really credible because not anybody, you know, there's no real NREL version of a solar cell you're getting getting really tested, right? And I think it probably did this field more harm. And looking back a decade, one of the and I was a Scialog fellow at the photocatalysis one, I think one of the things that they did really well is re-emphasize new mechanisms, like the search for and looking for new science that could power this. And if if that's what we could achieve here today, I think that would be incredibly powerful is is looking at what strands of mechanisms exist and how they could be brought together and then diverge again to get you to whatever product you want to get to. That could be superb. And Katie, you had, you didn't raise your hand but you were very excited about something.",

      "transcript": "Yeah, so Charles brought up a point that I was wanting to touch on is like is electrochemical versus photo conversion versus photocatalytic or photoelectrochemical conversion and I think thermochemical catalysis is also sort of in the prompt and what are the the differences or similarities in terms of mechanism for for these two? Can you like can you think of a catalyst that would on an electrochemically give you sort of one product distribution versus photocatalytically, thinking about semiconductors, photocatalytically give you a, you know, tune your product distribution through the mode of catalysis, I guess is what I'm getting at. And so having thinking about that and in the spirit of sort of all of the above solutions, right? If you if you come up with like if you focus too much on like electro-catalysis and you find like you know copper being the you know that's going to be our champion electrochemical electrocatalyst, is that enough to like then crank out copper, you know, are we running into a problem like there's not enough copper to do this on the scale that we want to do it on, right? And so I think sort of like an all of the above approach, so so thinking in on all axes is important. But I think you can learn from like the photoelectrocatalysis can learn from the electrocatalysis community and vice versa.",

It's very divided in the field, right? So the people that do electrocatalysis don't like the people that do thermocatalysis and and so on because they believe that they're the ones that know how to do it right. Right? So, so is there a way to compromise the stage where you can, I don't know, combine different avenues, I don't know, like is it possible to combine electrocatalysis with photocatalysis? That one is possible, I'm pretty sure. But like electrocatalysis with thermocatalysis and things like that to achieve different products or perhaps modify the mechanisms to achieve better efficiencies or more reliable efficiencies.",
