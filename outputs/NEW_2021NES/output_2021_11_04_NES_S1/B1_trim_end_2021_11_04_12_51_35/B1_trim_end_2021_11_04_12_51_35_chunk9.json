Today, we're going to brainstorm some novel approaches to accelerating drug discovery using AI, specifically for neurodegenerative diseases. Ben, I know you had some initial thoughts on leveraging genomic data. Do you want to start?",

            "transcript": "Yeah, thanks, Lauren. I was thinking we could develop a predictive model that integrates multi-omics data—genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics—to identify novel drug targets. The key challenge is the heterogeneity of the data. But if we use a graph neural network approach, we could model the complex biological interactions and potentially uncover pathways that traditional methods might miss.",

            "transcript": "I love that, Ben. The GNN approach is powerful. To build on that, what if we also incorporate patient data from electronic health records? We could add another layer to the model, linking molecular data to clinical phenotypes. This could help us not just find targets, but also stratify patient populations for clinical trials. We'd need to be careful with data privacy, of course, but the potential is huge.",

            "transcript": "I agree, this is a promising direction. My main concern would be the computational cost and the interpretability of the GNN model. These can become black boxes. Maybe we could integrate a SHAP or LIME framework to help explain the model's predictions. That way, we can validate the biological relevance of the identified targets and pathways, making our findings more trustworthy for the bench scientists.",
