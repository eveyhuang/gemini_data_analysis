And I think Caroline brought this up at the very beginning like how do you you have certain intermediates how do you where do you go from there or how do you control like you said those reaction trajectories down specific pathways? And a lot of that is you're not going to or you know there's maybe high throughput is one way to go but you're really going to have to understand mechanisms to to to get good answers there.
