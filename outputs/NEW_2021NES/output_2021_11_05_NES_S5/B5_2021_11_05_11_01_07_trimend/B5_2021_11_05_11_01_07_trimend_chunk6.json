If let's say the earth has the calcium as in its calcium oxide base uh in the rock then I think we have a negative uh emission. We have we can have a negative uh absorption but it's already in the format of rock is based basically calcium carbonate um they already become a very big carbon you know absorber already over the past you know billions of years.",

So nature did all this trouble of sequestering all the fossil the carbon in the form of fossil fuels and nature also did that with limestone.

If policy can come in and say that look we need to treat limestone as a as already a carbon sink we we we should think twice before getting it out of the ground and using it for something then maybe they can give other materials a chance. I I I was thinking of this let's say when when we are comparing electric cars and gasoline cars uh for a long time we've seen that maybe electric cars are going to be going to be far away but what what has come to to to to be realized that well electric cars are fast they're fun and and people want want them uh so uh the issue is that in in building materials how can we make uh uh people change their perception of materials and want something that is uh more sustainable uh so that we don't touch those easy to access natural materials.",

So actually nice program um branding I'd say for Raphael for your universities that those are the key words people want to hear. And I've been here I've been at the BU 10 years. I was at the DU before that. So we're talking about 15 to 20 years that I've been somewhat in the field between graduate school and elsewhere. It's flipped. It's flipping fast and it's been in the last I I'd argue like five years that the students, right?
