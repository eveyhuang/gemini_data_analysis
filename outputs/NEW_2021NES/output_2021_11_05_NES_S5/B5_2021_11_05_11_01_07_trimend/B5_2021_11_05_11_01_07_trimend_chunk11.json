            "transcript": "Yes, so I'm Katie Knowles, I'll be sort of reporting out what we did based on the sort of detailed notes that Ellen took uh during our discussion. And so um so we're talking about uh materials for separation and storage and uh we talked a lot about the challenges for materials discovery and development. And I think some of these um are continuing on some themes that were discussed in other groups. So gaps between computational predictions and experiments, the fact that like if um if a computational study identifies a new material that might be um advantageous for uh separation or storage application, it takes time to actually synthesize that material or it might not be possible to synthesize that material. So um taking uh feasibility into account when doing these um these uh sort of computational uh predictions. Um we also I uh identified the the need for training sets for machine learning approaches. So um uh sufficient characterization data under the dynamic operating conditions that a lot of these um sorbents uh work under um is needed uh for for this. Um we also talked about some of the challenges with scale up. So so lab scale experiments synthesis versus application scale. Um so things that you consider to be in operando on the lab scale might not truly represent your application scale um conditions. I think this was touched on in some other groups. Um so degradation processes and reversibility or cyclability issues for the um the sorbents that you know, absorb and then we want to release the CO2 at like the storage or conversion um area. A lot of these sorbents function at non-equilibrium conditions, so might eventually break down. Um some of these degradation products might be sort of the active materials in the storage or catalysis that you're doing. Um and then I think this point kind of goes back into the modeling where we need to understand what the uncertainties are in the model uh uh predictions in order to um you know, apply them in a useful way. Also interfaces are key in these uh sort of material applications but hard to understand. So interfaces is where most of the action happens but it's all these complex processes occur. The interfacial structure is dynamic and different than bulk structure and therefore hard to characterize. Um we also talked about some underexplored sort of physical phenomena related to um CO2 separation and storage. Um in this uh sort of the area of sorbents, we talked about light or using light or electrochemistry or humidity swings to trigger desorption might be sort of new um axes to think about um in this context. Um for storage, we talked about CO2 mineralization and some physical phenomena that needed to kind of understand or accelerate that process um or better understandings of precipitation and dissolution phenomena both sort of solid liquid. So at the solid liquid um interface when you're um sort of forming these sort of solid minerals and at the liquid gas interface when you're actually dissolving CO2 into your liquid um sorbent. We also talked about um some interesting ideas about mining, coupling mineralization with mining of valuable elements. And then finally we talked about some design criteria to keep in mind when when thinking about these things. So thermal conductivity especially if um you know, the heats of adsorption and desorption are playing a role in the sorbents, electrical conductivity for the electrochemical materials, transparency if we're talking about using uh light as a trigger. Um materials that can accommodate self-healing or assisted healing processes. Um and then just taking a lot of knowledge from the catalysis community um that they've developed about um adsorption and desorption and sort of balancing the energetics of those two processes and to inform the design of materials for um I think thinking about sorbents again in this case. So I think that sums up a lot of what we talked about.",

            "timestamp": "05:04-09:58",
            "transcript": "Um so we talked about methane capture and valorization and one of the initial um starts of the conversation was what are the potential emitters or emissions. Um and so we're thinking agricultural sites, um fossil fuels of course is a major emitter. Um but then also we have methane in the atmosphere. And so is it really conducive to uh try to capture um if we're going for negative emissions, methane out of the atmosphere and you know, how would that work? Will we work from point sources or do we work from dilute sources? And um it seems like we had agreement that maybe point sources would be the best option. However, um even if we try to um develop some sort of technology that can take methane from these point sources, they're actually pretty dilute in terms of they have a lot of variability. Um where you can have a few PPMs of methane to hundreds of PPM. Um for example at agricultural sources. And then there's other mediations um for removing methane. Um uh for example from cows and that's changing their diets and and um other technological innovations like having the mask or something. Um but if we talk about uh developing technological solutions that we can eventually implement here with the um people there within this group, um we talked about a lot of different things. And I'd say that you can probably divide it into three. So it's leaving the chemistry of methane alone, the molecule, which is naturally nonpolar and then doing something with that, maybe changing the pressure or temperature to try to store it. Um the second is trying to make it more reactive. And so we talked about the idea of reactive absorption. And then the last thing um is actually taking inspiration from nature. So using microbes. And so um the I'll go along this list of possible solutions. One of the first ones was why don't we just oxidize methane all the way to CO2? Um and even though it sounds like it might be counterintuitive, we could potentially possibly integrate this in direct air capture um technology. And so um even though it is um something that might sound controversial, it still will get the ball rolling because we have existing technology for um direct air capture that we can possibly utilize in combination with some sort of oxidation of methane steam. Another um possible solution is actually um forming methane clathrates. And so if this solution if we was to um approach it is to add water, have high pressures, but the downside is that you have very low temperatures about -20 degrees Celsius to form these methane clathrates. And actually this is a solution that has been um starting to develop in Japan and they actually have some technology to do this. Um another um idea that was really exciting um in terms of of the way that we would add some sort of functionality or activity to methane is what we uh deem as reactive absorption. Um which is also something that's explored with CO2 as well. Um so the ideas explored here was the use of electric fields to some somehow mediate methane absorption or we can use light to activate the carbon hydrogen bonds. Um so that it's more reactive to absorption of a sorbate uh sorbent species. Um there's also when um some interest perhaps in the development of electro photocatalyst systems in which we can activate the methane um and then um sort of uh convert it into something that's more reactive and then um uh in a for in effect have a negative emission technology here or um do some sort of radical chemistry that can um pull these bonds away and they get more reactive. Um and as far as inspiration from nature, um we can also have methane capture by enzymes. There is this enzymes that can absorb methane um at relatively low concentrations and at um ambient pressures. Um and then there's also microbes that can capture methane um from relatively low concentrations as well. Um that's everything that we discussed for the methane capture valorization uh conversation and adjust.",
