Zorbit properties we discussed well we got on a tangent where we're talking about um that Zorbins might can we just design a Zorbit that works for both capture and storage, but also um that that we one might one Zorbit might not fit all the criteria because they're geographically specific or obviously the environment's going to play a role in what Zorbit is a good Zorbit.",

Um but we're discussing basically like that there this is just opportunities of of different DAC systems. Okay, let's see. Um down here I've kind of put these as underneath DAC. Point of source versus direct air capture or combined. If you're building infrastructure for point of source capture um there's a capital benefit for coupling. Um development and optimization of treatment trains may be a pathway to get to net negative over the life of the plant. Um and then there's a lot of discussion on soils which some of that I did not I missed but pre concentrating CO2 in soils and buildings and leveraging H fac systems. I think this is essentially having the discussion of um how we can combine existing infrastructure for DAC.",

This is when people were talking about airplane submarines, spacecraft um given the fuel consumption especially in transportation that's the motivation. Um combining capture with low carbon energy sources. Um we talked about the capital costs for right now direct air capture is around $300 to $500 per ton um where at point of source it's you know, 100 um and getting to $100 per ton we discussed pragmatic engineering approaches um where repurposing infrastructure may get us there faster. Um we discussed briefly policy and its role and there was again example of soil health where you can motivate farmers essentially um to use best practices because you know, there might be a benefit to so essentially a duality of benefits um beyond capture but also soil health. Um and yeah, the concrete if we can add some more this is when I was playing around with the organization if there's anything about the concrete that um you guys felt was salient that I missed, let me know.",
