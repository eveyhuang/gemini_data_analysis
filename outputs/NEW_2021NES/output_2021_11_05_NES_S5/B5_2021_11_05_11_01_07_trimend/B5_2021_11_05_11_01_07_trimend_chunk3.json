The energetics for doing DAC are out an order of magnitude higher than point source, so why not just focus on the point source there?",

If I'm wrong about the numbers, but based on the state of the art technology, um if you direct capture CO2 from air, the price could be $300 to $500 per ton of CO2 to do the capture. Uh but from point sources that could be around $100 or even lower sometimes uh depending on the um energy input. Um yeah, I think the direct capture is uh is completely uh more challenging than the point sources. And uh I think uh people also calculated that the about one third of the emissions are coming from the point source. So uh it could be a very near term target for us to to invest more on covering that. But long term for sure direct air capture is the ultimate goal for us to remove the CO2 from air.",

Um but in the future when there's a ton of renewable power out there, there's going to be big spikes where there's like tons of wind or solar on the grid and then you have to kind of shut down all of your, you know, or a lot of your natural gas. So the thought is mode two would happen when there's tons of power, there's a surplus on the grid and you need to either shut down or use it for something else. So you could possibly use your own electricity in house to power a DAC system. Um so you're sending your electricity now to your own DAC system and you're also using compressed air off of the natural gas compressor possibly um to go to your DAC system, which is great because it's like 15 or 20 times the pressure of, you know, regular air, so you have higher partial pressures of CO2, so you can get much better performance from DAC. Um so that's the idea. There there's other concepts out there. They're proposing similarish things, but something like this where you can kind of oscillate between two modes and do some direct air capture. Um and the thought is that you could go negative emissions over the lifespan of this plant possibly if you have enough mode two going on.",

I'm on the DAC part of this project and, you know, trying to model sorbents that will do carbon capture over a wide range of inputs is interesting. So that's kind of why I brought that up earlier is that, okay, like there's sometimes where it's just taking exhaust from the membrane, but there's other times where it's taking a lot of air and so, you know, tailoring different, you know, sorbents to that sort of range and flexibility is an interesting problem.",
