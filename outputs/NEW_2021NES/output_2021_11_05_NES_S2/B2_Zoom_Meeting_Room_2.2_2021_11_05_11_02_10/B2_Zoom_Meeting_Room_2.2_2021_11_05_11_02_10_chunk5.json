I if your goal is to like sequester the CO2 then um, you know, you have to be at the right geographical location. I guess there are all host of um, like more political issues there, like who is going to have the liability if you're going to sequester it for the next, I don't know, 100 years. Um, yeah, I I I think my thought is that um, the there are so many very variables when you think about uh, that technology, right? You know, where the the the the temperatures, the humidity, but also you know, what you are doing with CO2. I I think that's why it's so important to make use of CO2 in some ways. And we always talk about electrochemical or like some other means of reducing CO2 to something else. Um, something that I haven't really thought a lot about is um, you know, there's also interest in um, you know, ammonia synthesis. I mean, could these things be coupled? Like can we maybe think a little bit outside of the box and not not just focus on, you know, converting carbon dioxide to like methane or you know, syngas, but can we also add nitrogen to it and and maybe make some other products. Um, that might I don't know. That might require some work on the catalyst, but um,",

And that's the reason why it's a little challenging for players to get into it because it's not a clean problem and it's not a problem that has profit attached to it.

So right now, when we look at all the fossil fuel divestments that are happening across all the universities, it seems like people are pointing their fingers to fossil fuel companies and saying you have to take the responsibility for emitting CO2. But really they're just selling the commodity and we're consuming it every time we turn on our lights. So who takes the end responsibility for that? I think that's a much more complex question.",

            "transcript": "I was just going to comment on that uh and uh maybe share some results from a recent paper that we've published. So I'm a uh systems modeler and we were looking at carbon capture and storage projects globally, but what we had data for were the 34 in the US that were uh let's see, projected to happen, said they were going to happen, but then they didn't happen. And so most of the uh storage or use of carbon that happens now and has been happening since the 70s is enhanced oil recovery to help produce uh oil from oil wells. Uh and one of the the problems as uh Greeshma was alluding to is like what what else can you do with it? So uh the carbon there has been carbon capture at some point sources, the most successful is at uh coal fired power plants, but still not everyone is doing it and the question is why? If it's the technology is there, uh why aren't we doing it? Uh and one of the sad cases was uh the the Petro Nova plant in Texas. They had been uh capturing carbon at the source and but just this February they stopped doing it because the price of oil was too low. So they have all the technology in place and it's just sitting there. Uh and one of the things that we found was that you you need a credible revenue stream for your CO2. It can't just be sequestering it. You need you need you need the company to make some kind of money off of it. So what kind of products can we make with this? I think is a really interesting question.",

That's probably not enough for a lot of projects. That's a federal tax code in the US. And then the California low carbon fuel standard now also gives credits for demonstrated capture and sequestration and those credits trade between $100 and $200 a ton.",
