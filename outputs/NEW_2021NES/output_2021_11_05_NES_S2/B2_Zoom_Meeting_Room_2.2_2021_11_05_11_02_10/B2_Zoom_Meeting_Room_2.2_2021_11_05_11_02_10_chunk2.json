Um, I'm not an expert on this by any stretch of imagination and I know that the greenhouse gas, you know, um, you know, it's it's a bad greenhouse gas, but you know, from what I've read and heard discussions on, there is the question about, you know, the lifespan in the atmosphere of methane compared to CO2, um, and the eventual breakdown to CO2, uh, and maybe just a distraction to go after methane, um, and uh, and to focus to pull focus from CO2 capture, um, when, um, you know, the lifespan of CO2 in the atmosphere versus methane is is, you know, significantly worse.

Um, at least I'm not choosing to go after it. I'm really interested in methane conversion. Um, I think there's a lot of things that can be done in a really productive way for methane conversion, but um, I think that, you know, PPB methane capture is maybe a bit of a wild goose chase.",

I think it can be argued that it is because of its lifetime in the atmosphere, it's more worth worrying about CO2. But on the other hand, I think harking back to something we discussed in a different group yesterday, there may be uh ways to or strategies that might make sense for capturing methane locally at a, you know, almost a point source where it is actually melting permafrost where it has relatively high concentrations, that may be a really good strategic thing to do. And I don't, but I don't know about efforts, you know, technological uh efforts to do that. It's a great question though.",

I wanted to hear if anybody else had any stability comments. And I think the stability issue is one that is very technology dependent. Um, so, you know, um just under ambient temperate conditions, if you think about the major ways that people have already published taking CO2 out of the atmosphere, you know, you have stabilities on the order of, you know, probably weeks to decades for the technology and the materials and um then you have to look at sort of the life cycle techno economic analysis aspect of it and and find out how long is long enough and that's going to vary by technology as well.",

Um, one of the sort of conventional wisdom is that it's always going to be cheaper to uh to capture at um uh point sources. However, um point sources are much harsher environments than the ambient conditions of of DAC in general. So is it automatically the case that once you do fold in especially durability that point sources are are better than uh capturing from air or can air compete with uh point sources because it can maybe be more durable.",

So is it are like sorry, so ion exchange membranes, I know are proposed for for direct air capture. Um and there are other um I guess polymer based materials for direct air capture. In the context of point source where you have a harsher environment, are those materials able to withstand um those conditions? And I'm being vague because I don't know the exact conditions or materials, but um there are a lot of chemists here, so I figure somebody will be able to comment intelligently.",

Um, I'm a little conflicted on that one because and same thing with Ellen's comment, like I'm I'm conflicted with saying that it's a harsher environment that the polymers can't stand up to or uh in general because I mean we we can treat the environment. Um, you know, if it's too hot, we can cool it. If there's some um harsh reaction gases, you know, in the blend, we can crash them out, pull them out before they they reach this step. So I don't know. I guess I'm I'm still a little bit conflicted as whether as to whether the biggest impact can come from point source uh or direct air because the the the amount the purely from a concentration perspective, we all know that the driving forces are there for the point source. Um, but if you look at a systems wide perspective, my question is, if we do collect all of the point source or all of the easy low hanging fruit of point source uh CO2, can the environment naturally absorb the the additional CO2 or is the direct air going to be needed regardless of it? That's that's kind of more my curiosity or lack of knowledge.",
