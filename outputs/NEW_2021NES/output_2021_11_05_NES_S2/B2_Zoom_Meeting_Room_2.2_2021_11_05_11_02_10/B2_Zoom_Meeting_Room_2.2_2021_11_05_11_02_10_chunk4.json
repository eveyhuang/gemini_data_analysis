Um, and as things start to be piloted. Um so I think it's okay that it takes it takes generations to get there. Um, but I think that uh durability going back to the comment about durability, durability does encapsulate these complexities. And so, um, yeah, so I'm not 100% in the CO2 capture world.",

            "transcript": "Um, you know, it it would be interesting. I'm sure the Department of Energy does have these certain metrics independent of um by doing normalization, right? In in dilute solution separations and seawater separations, we can actually we still compare them um and you know, we compare them, you know, based off of looking at not just specific energy consumption because we know that will change depending on the concentration, but we we normalize it um so that we can predict durability challenges and things like that. Um, so I think that you know, you can't compare durability directly at directly or capture or you shouldn't be able to, you know, be able to compare durability just on a time scale, um, for two different technologies, but you should be able to like normalize uh to look at what to make to aid decision makers in uh whether something makes sense or not. Um so I guess I'll pass the ball to anyone who's in this field and in are you able to discuss like how durability is normalized for these different applications and for I know we we it's going to be dependent on technology, but but are there do the Department of Energy have technology agnostic targets for durability.",

            "transcript": "At this stage for DAC I would say not. Right now at this stage for DAC most of the targets that I've seen from both private and government organizations focused on uh um you know, just demonstrated viability and cost. And obviously durability comes in under cost. Um, and as you said it's going to vary for different technology areas. So one Marta and I work at the same university and one of our colleagues Ryan Lively uh working with Matthew Ralph just recently did a systems level analysis of Bex incorporating for those of you who don't know Bex is bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration. So it also involves carbon capture in the similar way to post combustion or or DAC. And for that system they found that the magic number was about a year of durability and that much less than a year if you got durabilities less than that, you got significant increases in cost, but that the curve turned over between one and two years such that the difference between one year and three years was diminishing returns and there really wasn't a lot to be gained there. So I'll use that as an introduction to point out that if you are, you know, a molecular chemist or if you're somebody who works on materials for um, you know, conversion or capture, it's good to think about trying to also partner with and collaborate with uh systems people who can look at the whole system because it's very difficult to understand the importance of something like lifetime if you're only looking at a small component of an overall process. And I know Silog, Sloan, a lot of the other foundations are very basic science focused and I think that's an important part of what we should be doing here, but I also think that they would encourage collaborations and insights from systems level people who can help to give context to the to the basic science we produce.",

So even if you think that your solution might only be a small fraction of the solution, right? We still need it. I don't think this is a type of problem where there's going to be, you know, two or three solutions that dominate. There's not going to be a Google, I don't think of, you know, direct air capture for example. So, um, yeah, I think don't be discouraged by the fact that the numbers are so overwhelming.",

Um, but I've been thinking about, you know, how does the different climates and geographies really impact the technologies that are feasible. And then as an extension of that, it's a global problem and is it the responsibility of the developed countries to do all of this or should we be developing technologies that are easy to implement in more remote uh developing parts of the world that um you know, might bring jobs and and be beneficial in other ways, but would have to be, I don't know, maybe smaller or portable. Um, and you know, thinking about as you said, there's got to be many solutions and I just that's what was on my mind and if people have comments.",

            "transcript": "I had a comment. In terms of the first question, I can provide a system analysis for the mechanical trees system, which is the ion exchange membrane developed by Lackner. They their team did an analysis of siting their system, which they developed in Arizona, I guess. And they cited it somewhere in the Indian Ocean where the temperature swing was between 0 degrees Celsius and 10 degrees Celsius and they they did a system analysis showing that it's feasible to develop a system that still works to capture CO2, but the system efficiency is much poorer in that situation and that's because they use a moisture swing process. So I can share that paper with you and it shows explicitly the difference between the performance of their system in the desert in California or Arizona and somewhere in the Indian Ocean.",

            "transcript": "But from a chemical processing perspective for those of us who work in those areas, right? Normally if you imagine developing a process, you're going to run it the same everywhere in the world, whether it's in, you know, Kuwait or Canada or Chile or South Africa, right? It's it's going to be say 200 degrees C, five bars pressure, whatever it is. That's not the case for DAC. It is going to be constant that it's going to be around say 300 to 600 parts per million CO2 so you can design around that, but if you look at the absolute humidity and how it varies say in the desert in the winter compared to, you know, near the equator in the summer, you have orders of magnitude variations in water content. And that's a a major competitor for CO2 absorption on any any material. And so you can imagine that if you're in a cold climate like Alaska, um the the driving force for absorption based on the temperature and humidity is going to be very different from what it is in, you know, Gainesville, Florida as an as an example. And I think that's a further element that not many people have thought about and when we started thinking about just a simple question of after working in the field for 10 years designing materials to operate at room temperature because that's what the lab temperature is. When we asked a simple question, what would we do differently if we were at minus 10 or minus 20 degrees C, it really opened some different ways of thinking about the problem and we were able that potentially find materials and processes under those conditions that might actually have a lower energy penalty. Uh because there's a stronger driving force for absorption, you can use more physisorption so you don't have to pay the high penalty of desorbing a chemisorbent. And so thinking about varied operational conditions I think can maybe unlock some fresh ideas if you haven't thought about that before.",

And again like what countries are responsible and like who's actually going to pay for this, right? Whether whether it's implemented in all the countries or just in the wealthier countries.",
