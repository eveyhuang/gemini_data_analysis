Um but even net neutral uh avoids a lot of emissions and is not you know can be um can contribute to both defossilizing and decarbonizing. Um so would anybody like to comment on those strategies or the importance of one over other or do we need to do it all.",

So whether we end up with a a carbon society and nitrogen ammonia I mean the just based on how we use the energy as electricity instead of the need to store it in carbon I think yes the there will be a shift um one way or another here hopefully.",

Um and given the high concentrations of CO2 it would be very appealing to put in a technology and I'm sure those of us who are on the those of us who are doing process scale assessments will show that the cost of capturing CO2 from such smoke stacks can be substantially lower compared to say other alternative approaches. Question really is somebody's actually got to go out and do it and why aren't we doing it right now.",

      "transcript": "So here's what I had written up uh if you can see the the slide if you can see the share screen. Um so the key opportunities are that the DAC it can actually be deployed independently from point source emissions and with continued use of fossil fuels particularly from sources that are very challenging to capture from we will need to have DAC technologies implemented there's no doubt about it. But there are several challenges and really embedded opportunities that were presented and one of them is the fact that the variability of the compositions is quite high and the scale of the problem is significant. And what this implies is that we need to have multiple solutions that need to be developed and encouraged from the standpoint of carbon removal and carbon capture. Uh the second uh point that was raised was really more of a question which was how do we actually normalize durability for different technologies accounting for variability in compositions and we don't quite have an answer for that yet and so that's something that we need to continue putting resources into to work on. Uh the third point was about the need to integrate molecular scale interactions with process scale engineering is is particularly if you're looking to develop new materials. Thinking about realistic environments and where we can successfully deploy an emerging technology is really important uh in that context. The impact of varied operational conditions can actually unlock some fresh ideas and innovation I would say in DAC as well as an industrial decarbonization. Um so I'll need to add the industrial decarbonization piece and again feel free to interrupt me at any moment to you know to make sure that I'm capturing all of the ideas that we discussed carefully.",
