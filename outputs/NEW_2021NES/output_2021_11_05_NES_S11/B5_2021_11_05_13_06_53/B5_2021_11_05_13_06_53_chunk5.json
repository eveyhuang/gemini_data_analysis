It will also tell us kind of coming back if we know what the error at the smallest scale if we truly believe that we've mapped out all of the mechanisms and all of the you know electron proton coupling steps and whatever you might be including into your model if you know what how big of an error it is at the smallest scale what would that mean at for that mass transport and the kinetics and the and all of the other steps at a grain boundary or in a in a porous medium right?

So we had a lot of discussions in in the previous breakout room was you know a lot of these high throughput studies what they can do and what some of their limitations are and then actually introducing complexity it costs a lot. So we also need to know where to start which are the systems that we truly want to actually invest in making those extremely detailed studies right so recognizing what the limitations at each and one of these modeling endeavors are before we take it to the next scale so to speak I think is something that is crucial.",

A few times in this conversation already DFT has kind of come up as here's the standard for small scales but one of the best known flaws of especially your cheap DFT methods that you can actually do for these surfaces is it's not good at charge transfer states and charge transfer states for any of this photocatalysis electrocatalysis type stuff are absolutely critical. And so even what we're mapping out on these smallest scales that we can do has more inaccuracies built into it than most people like to admit.",

But yes absolutely I think actually it is completely I wouldn't say completely but it is quite unknown what exactly the role of a coupled proton electron step versus a decoupled one is in these electrochemical systems in general. There are a few systems where it has been studied. There's some in the molecular catalysis or community there's a lot of work but for surfaces this is actually very a very very challenging it's a long-standing challenging problem how do you include charge and how do you model that and there are some efforts of course but I think those are still big big big challenges that that still remain which is good we have a lot of of work ahead of us.",

So if I like if I'm looking at a molecular system for example if I tweak the electrophilicity of one particular group at one end I have some intuition about how that would impact the resulting kinetics. So to a certain extent we can give meaningful results even though the underlying method does not capture let's say for example charge transfer states.",

I can model something but I don't have an exact number to compare it to but look like you're saying intuitively or just you know known known quantities that it increases when we expect it to increase that's not always kind of good enough when when you talk to the community I find. So I agree with you but it runs up against a limit and the one thing I kind of hear us talking about here is you know basically the idea of VVUQ right? Verification validation and certainty quantification and we started out with this conversation of propagating it. I feel like that's although I don't think it's easy I think there's so many challenges to it like that's what what I feel like experimentalists often want to see to know that back to what we were saying before we're only modeling what we can but that we're modeling reality or as close as we can to a reality.",

And I think the danger is sometimes we extrapolate too quickly and say well this works well here so this this method also should work here and then that's not that's not really the case right? So so finding trends on on homogeneous catalyst I think is is great. Trying to define trends on on heterogeneous surfaces I think is I think a lot much more challenging and I think we extrapolate too fast I think.",

How do we then go ahead and actually model the role of the environment which is kind of the other typical thing that you know especially in these complex chemistries how do we how do we actually go ahead and include that?",
