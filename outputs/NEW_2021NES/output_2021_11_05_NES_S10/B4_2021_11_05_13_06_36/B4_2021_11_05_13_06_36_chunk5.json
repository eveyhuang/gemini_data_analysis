And so another waste product that um is getting a lot of interest right now is plastics. And um there are so you mentioned Ellen about um public opinion. So there are companies now that are looking to uh recycle plastics because based on public opinion which is also motivating customers that are now telling their companies like, hey, what are you how are you making your bottles and and there's a company in in Riverside called Niagara and they do a lot of bottling for um Walmart and Target and they're getting pressure from Walmart and Target of like how are you recycling your plastics? Um so that's a little segue to another maybe interesting topic of maybe utilizing CO2 if we're not using petrochemicals, maybe utilizing CO2 for plastics. I don't know if that might be interesting reimagined um area for CO2 utilization. I know there's there is active research in that right now.",

So you put that CO2 into your plastic, if your plastic is biodegradable, then in what form is that CO2 going to end up in back in the environment? And if it's very recalcitrant, I think that's what they call it, hard to degrade, you don't want that in the environment either.",

I have I have some experience on that because part of my post research is reducing carbon dioxide and make bioplastic and the bioplastic are to some extent biodegradable because microbes can take that as a energy source. Um and and and I think it's a neutral it's a neutral process neutral emission technology for sure. Um and and and the the one some people would say that there are actually some environmental benefits if you put a bioplastic into the soil because not necessarily all of them but some bioplastics because of the reason nature some organisms produce bioplastic is a energy storage mechanism for them uh in the hard times that the microbes can survive through harsh conditions. So those actually are additional carbon um reservoirs to increase the robustness of the ecosystem. Um and that's sometimes people So even though eventually they coming to the carbon cycle carbon dioxide get emitted into come atmosphere, but there actually are some ecological arguments saying that you are benefiting the soil robustness by providing some additional food for them during the harsh time for the microbes, yeah.",

Uh carbon it's uh it's a it's a in a supply chain shortage right now. Um but I did a bit of the literature study on on this technology, you know, converting carbon dioxide to carbon. I have no I have found no technology that's energy efficient. Uh you have to you know, the carbon is formed in nature, you know, in coal, high pressure, high temperature and and taking carbon dioxide to to to carbon also need to have that kind of rush has reaction environment. So it's so far it's not yet energy efficient. But um but it can solve one problem with the carbon supply chain problem, but it creates other problem because where's the energy from?
