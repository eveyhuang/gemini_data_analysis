So so maybe electrochemistry is at the heart of all the negative emissions technologies that that is a possibility but it would really help me to know like kind of where what what is the consensus like where where will electrochemistry come in and play like the dominant role. Maybe at this stage this is too early to say that and we are in a phase where we're kind of like scouting around and trying to figure out like how how we're solving this problem in the first place, right? But I I generally think um yeah, I I really would like to figure out um like where uh where we are where where electrochemistry is is is making an impact and whether there are like a certain set of categories maybe electro catalysis, electrochemical capture. Um I don't know, we don't have much time left but if if anyone uh wants to chime in, I would be interested.",

I think that uh we want at some point the answer the the sort of judge be industry and the commercial um um entity actually implements it. I I think that, you know, for a lot of technologies, you have all these competitive things and then it's only becomes like a solution when it's implemented by industry. So I don't know if we can come up with an answer because we're developing the methods. I think that um the judge at the end is society has to take one of these systems and implement it. And uh so I don't know if electro catalysis is implemented in industry um uh right now for carbon capture in any way. I think the startups are really the the interface. So um that's my opinion.",
