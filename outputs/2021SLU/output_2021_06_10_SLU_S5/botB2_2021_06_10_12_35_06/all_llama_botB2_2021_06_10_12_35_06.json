So just getting into it quickly the the few things I had written down is that um you know, this this kind of comes directly from the questions but water, you know, we think of it as so central to life, but like it's worth considering other solvents, you know, like if we're thinking about Titan or methane or other things like that and I think that per Dimitar's comment about um, you know, how is this even relevant to life on earth? I think that the other solvent question could be relevant to life on earth because, you know, from some of uh for instance like Nick Hud's work, uh there's been work on kind of hypersaline environments and alternative solvents that come from a lot of solute from an aqueous solution that when you concentrate it, you have something that's still liquid that you can do interesting chemistry in. Um the third and there's five here just so you know where I am on this. um is uh, you know, thinking about prebiotic chemistry. I think we think of it as something that happened and then there was life, but I think that it's worth considering it as we I think of these questions as kind of a progress bar for the emergence of life, you know, we go from low complexity to kind of what Dimitar was talking about higher complexity. Um and I think that that might kind of inform some of our thinking about, you know, we're talking about with exoplanets. Uh and then finally the last two are kind of related. Um there's going to obviously be some geochemical constraints on what kind of protobiomolecules emerge and that's going to vary from body to body. Um and this is going to have uh, you know, impacts from a chemical perspective in terms of, you know, what surfaces are presented and what kind of chemistry you can do on those surfaces as well as and this kind of ties into the geochemistry, um, you know, temperature and pressure. I think that there are environments that are close enough to an earthlike environment where the chemistry could be quite similar, you know, like Mars, you're at, you know, a few millibar. I think most of the same stuff can be done there, but if you're thinking about a high pressure environment, that can have pretty profound effects on folding of biopolymers and there's been experiments done with that. So those are the few things that came to mind for me. Um and uh I'm definitely interested in hearing uh what everyone else has to say about this.",

This is true for like the NASA RCNs, exobiology and everything else. And then we have all these planetary science questions about other worlds and life in other worlds, but there is no funding that I've ever found where you could study the possible origin of life on another world in a non-earth like manner. And so that's that's been a real problem for someone who's interested in life detection like me because, you know, I want to say, well, on Mars, for example, could you have life begin in some other way than Earth, but you can't really do those experiments.",

But I also wonder, you know, there could just be main similarities between life here and life on exoplanets, but the but the origin of life was actually different than it was on Earth and maybe with the initial steps of chemical evolution were different. So it could be carbon based, it could be in water, but it's still not the same as Earth. And so there's a lot of experiments that could be done, even big things early on like minerals direct reactions, but how exactly and which minerals are prevalent and, you know, you could imagine like I think on early Earth, the redox state of the planet was a huge factor because you have let's say iron two very rich in the oceans and an atmosphere of mostly CO2 and what is the redox state of the atmosphere? What is the redox state of the mantle? Like these are huge drivers for what sort of reactions you might have even with all the same chemicals that we are used to.

You this what you're making or producing will have to kind of fit the proto cells or whatever form of life is there for extended period of time. So it's not that we are talking about major cataclysms or catastrophes, uh, we also talking about slight changes in the environment which may kind of cut off this supply chain if you will that is feeding the proto cells. And does anybody know how long this uh kind of subsistence uh lack of self-sufficiency uh can last before they become self-sustained? Because that's that's what I think Kim was talking about, you know, it's not just make them and they will come.

So like, do you need, for example, let's say protein metabolism to happen inside the cell membrane or can that sort of happen outside and then, you know, and so it's hard to know where in the timing that all occurs because no one really knows the order of operations. And the other the other problem from a chemistry perspective is, you know, you look at the vast timeline of Earth and then in the lab you're basically zooming in in in on one little bit and you can do an experiment, but even if you look at the whole origin of life, which is a blip geologically, then even then you're zooming in super thin. And so any experiment that anyone's doing is going to be like this much and then you have to come back out and then you have to come back in at a different point to do the next experiment because it's not it's not just not possible for one person or lab to do the whole origin of life because you have to the time scale just doesn't make sense. Like how many chemical reactions can happen in months or a thesis time or something like that. So this is why we all work on different reactions, but they all have to connect conceptually.",

You can't make a long strand of RNA from simple molecules.

And it's like this for silica phosphorus nitrogen and so you end up having to do just an infinite amount of experiments to really understand what's going on and I don't know if the models are able to predict these things or if maybe just more modeling needs to be done before we do the experiment.

Um, and there are measurements from Dimitar for instance and other labs where they've looked at um, uh, the impact of this on nucleo bases and it can be pretty profound. Um, especially with hard UV, um, you know, it can just degrade the nucleo bases and basically chew them up into smaller molecules or in kind of the more benign uh UVB UVC range, um, you can start to see things like for instance if you have a strand of DNA and if there's two Ts next to each other, there's a reaction that's UV promoted where it'll actually cross link those into a dimer. So all that stuff is going on and that UV that uh UV induced dimer formation that actually happens in living things right now. That's one of the main things that uh repair enzymes have to deal with. So it um that's just kind of what we think about as UV is generally chewing this stuff up and it can cause photochemical reactions that we don't want. That said, um, you know, there's been some work using UV as kind of a plus because it can, you know, you can photochemically promote some of these uh syntheses. But for the most part, uh we kind of think of it as a problem, you know, like assume that we get to the point where we have these monomers because like I said, we kind of live in this space where it's, you know, assume for the sake of argument that we have these molecules, what's going to happen in terms of their assembly, UV is a problem that we always have to deal with. So that's kind of how we think about it.",

So I think I always think it's most important to focus on the non equilibrium reactions because those are not easy to model and radical chemistry is not easy to solve and anything that's kind of messy I think more easily studied in the lab. So like if planetary scientists could give us, you know, a top five list of things that would be cool to know about, that then we would go do all the experiments, but it's hard to know what to focus on sometimes because you read papers about early earth was like this or Mars is like that and then you do five years of experiments and then it's like no actually the atmosphere is this actually and you're like, oh man, that would have changed everything and so it is just a difficult sometimes to know what conditions to begin.",

And then the chemists could make which parameters are most effective in changing the way a chemical reaction turns out because you know certain ones you change them in the lab it is not that big of a deal. Other ones you change it, it changes everything and where that overlap is could be, you know, a shorter list where we could focus in the lab. Like if for example it turned out that massive differences in the amount of methane in the atmosphere are going to exist, but methane also really controls all of organic chemistry.
