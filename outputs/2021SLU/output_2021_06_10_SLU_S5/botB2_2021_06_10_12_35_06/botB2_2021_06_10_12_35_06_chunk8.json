So could could exoplanet or planetary science people make a list of which parameters are most variable between different planets because that would allow you to say which planet could or could not do a thing. And then the chemists could make which parameters are most effective in changing the way a chemical reaction turns out because you know certain ones you change them in the lab it is not that big of a deal. Other ones you change it, it changes everything and where that overlap is could be, you know, a shorter list where we could focus in the lab. Like if for example it turned out that massive differences in the amount of methane in the atmosphere are going to exist, but methane also really controls all of organic chemistry. That would be a thing to focus on. But then other things like maybe wouldn't.",
