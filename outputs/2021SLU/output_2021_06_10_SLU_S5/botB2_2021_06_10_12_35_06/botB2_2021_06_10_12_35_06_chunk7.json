So I think I always think it's most important to focus on the non equilibrium reactions because those are not easy to model and radical chemistry is not easy to solve and anything that's kind of messy I think more easily studied in the lab. So like if planetary scientists could give us, you know, a top five list of things that would be cool to know about, that then we would go do all the experiments, but it's hard to know what to focus on sometimes because you read papers about early earth was like this or Mars is like that and then you do five years of experiments and then it's like no actually the atmosphere is this actually and you're like, oh man, that would have changed everything and so it is just a difficult sometimes to know what conditions to begin.",

So at least I found me doing a theory point of view on the exoplanets, you can just choose like explore the parameter space and you don't need to throw them away because there could be like a planet just like that. So so I think for the plan um like planet people working on planets giving you the list, uh it's actually like a more question to you like which parameter would be easier for the experimental setup because there are so many possibilities for the exoplanets, we could find um the environment just possibly like um which is easier for you to do and find the like um the the um more sensitive parameters for the outcome.

Um, but we don't know, you know, the results for those uh, you know, how how that, you know, related to the real situation, the real worlds out there.
