If you look at say the electron transport chain, you've got, you know, hydrophilic type reactions and then suddenly you've got stuff going on that can only really happen not in water.

This is true for like the NASA RCNs, exobiology and everything else. And then we have all these planetary science questions about other worlds and life in other worlds, but there is no funding that I've ever found where you could study the possible origin of life on another world in a non-earth like manner. And so that's that's been a real problem for someone who's interested in life detection like me because, you know, I want to say, well, on Mars, for example, could you have life begin in some other way than Earth, but you can't really do those experiments.",

But I also wonder, you know, there could just be main similarities between life here and life on exoplanets, but the but the origin of life was actually different than it was on Earth and maybe with the initial steps of chemical evolution were different. So it could be carbon based, it could be in water, but it's still not the same as Earth. And so there's a lot of experiments that could be done, even big things early on like minerals direct reactions, but how exactly and which minerals are prevalent and, you know, you could imagine like I think on early Earth, the redox state of the planet was a huge factor because you have let's say iron two very rich in the oceans and an atmosphere of mostly CO2 and what is the redox state of the atmosphere? What is the redox state of the mantle? Like these are huge drivers for what sort of reactions you might have even with all the same chemicals that we are used to. And so that's the sort of stuff that I think would deserve more experimental investigation that kind of hasn't been done.",

And if if you could imagine it were younger then is it a prebiotic world now? And so that's really interesting to me and the organics in the plume are all things that we've made in the lab prebiotically, but they're also things that life makes. So",

There's also a lot of so the stability part is really interesting to me. How long",
