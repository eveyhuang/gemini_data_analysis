So just getting into it quickly the the few things I had written down is that um you know, this this kind of comes directly from the questions but water, you know, we think of it as so central to life, but like it's worth considering other solvents, you know, like if we're thinking about Titan or methane or other things like that and I think that per Dimitar's comment about um, you know, how is this even relevant to life on earth? I think that the other solvent question could be relevant to life on earth because, you know, from some of uh for instance like Nick Hud's work, uh there's been work on kind of hypersaline environments and alternative solvents that come from a lot of solute from an aqueous solution that when you concentrate it, you have something that's still liquid that you can do interesting chemistry in. Um the third and there's five here just so you know where I am on this. um is uh, you know, thinking about prebiotic chemistry. I think we think of it as something that happened and then there was life, but I think that it's worth considering it as we I think of these questions as kind of a progress bar for the emergence of life, you know, we go from low complexity to kind of what Dimitar was talking about higher complexity. Um and I think that that might kind of inform some of our thinking about, you know, we're talking about with exoplanets. Uh and then finally the last two are kind of related. Um there's going to obviously be some geochemical constraints on what kind of protobiomolecules emerge and that's going to vary from body to body. Um and this is going to have uh, you know, impacts from a chemical perspective in terms of, you know, what surfaces are presented and what kind of chemistry you can do on those surfaces as well as and this kind of ties into the geochemistry, um, you know, temperature and pressure. I think that there are environments that are close enough to an earthlike environment where the chemistry could be quite similar, you know, like Mars, you're at, you know, a few millibar. I think most of the same stuff can be done there, but if you're thinking about a high pressure environment, that can have pretty profound effects on folding of biopolymers and there's been experiments done with that. So those are the few things that came to mind for me. Um and uh I'm definitely interested in hearing uh what everyone else has to say about this. ",

What is the redox state of the mantle? Like these are huge drivers for what sort of reactions you might have even with all the same chemicals that we are used to.

Um, uh, I guess thinking about it in terms of Mars, which is probably the non-terran body that we think about the most. Um, you know, there are measurements of what's thought to be ancient Mars UV flux and current Mars UV flux based on changes in the atmosphere and the sun. Um, and there are measurements from Dimitar for instance and other labs where they've looked at um, uh, the impact of this on nucleo bases and it can be pretty profound. Um, especially with hard UV, um, you know, it can just degrade the nucleo bases and basically chew them up into smaller molecules or in kind of the more benign uh UVB UVC range, um, you can start to see things like for instance if you have a strand of DNA and if there's two Ts next to each other, there's a reaction that's UV promoted where it'll actually cross link those into a dimer. So all that stuff is going on and that UV that uh UV induced dimer formation that actually happens in living things right now. That's one of the main things that uh repair enzymes have to deal with. So it um that's just kind of what we think about as UV is generally chewing this stuff up and it can cause photochemical reactions that we don't want. That said, um, you know, there's been some work using UV as kind of a plus because it can, you know, you can photochemically promote some of these uh syntheses. But for the most part, uh we kind of think of it as a problem, you know, like assume that we get to the point where we have these monomers because like I said, we kind of live in this space where it's, you know, assume for the sake of argument that we have these molecules, what's going to happen in terms of their assembly, UV is a problem that we always have to deal with. So that's kind of how we think about it. ",
