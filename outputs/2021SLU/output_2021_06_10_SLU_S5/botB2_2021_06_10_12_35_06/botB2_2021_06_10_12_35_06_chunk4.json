And the flip side is there's another hypothesis that it is instability that leads to evolution, right? So to me there seems to be like another another fine window where you need to have some level of stability, but if it's too boring, maybe nothing will change. And so to me that's an interesting question that I think at least from the or history perspective, it gives us some examples of understanding the the stability question.",

Because this really strikes me listening to all of you talk about this in that, you know, I'm an astronomer. So for me the time scale like point zero starts way back when we initially form a star and a disc and then the disc forms planets and eventually that planet maybe, you know, cools down and has the conditions for life, right? And so, you know, in the scale of planet formation that I often think about, like what you guys are talking about is this like teensy teensy tiny little sliver of time.",

Those are systems that are even only like a few million years old, so they're vastly before any of this is going to happen. Um, and so it really strikes me as kind of an an interesting thing to like prod at how we, you know, can connect those time scales, right? Like what kind of observations can I go and make when I'm looking at a system that is two million years old and has barely formed planets yet that will tell us whether that system, you know, has solvents at all or where they're coming from and what they might be that, you know, in several billion years it might have prebiotic chemistry.",

So if it's too stable and then it may not be able to transfer like water or organic material to the terrestrial planets. And also from the earlier on stage. So it would be interesting to see like what's the chemical distribution along the radius of the system since the temperature difference is really large and the um metallicity or this um um not perhaps not metallicity but just um how the chemical ingredients would mix inside this proto planetary disc and form these planets and then further on how the instability of this planetary system may transfer this um um materials from outside to inside and vice versa and how this will distribute and allow complex life to emerge.",

And the same with like stellar activity. Is it happening at a level where you could promote early life and chemistry or is it happening too frequently and you're just killing everything, right?

In a particular setting. Uh, but then the question is, um, how do you um think about the long-term outcome of this? You this what you're making or producing will have to kind of fit the proto cells or whatever form of life is there for extended period of time. So it's not that we are talking about major cataclysms or catastrophes, uh, we also talking about slight changes in the environment which may kind of cut off this supply chain if you will that is feeding the proto cells. And does anybody know how long this uh kind of subsistence uh lack of self-sufficiency uh can last before they become self-sustained? Because that's that's what I think Kim was talking about, you know, it's not just make them and they will come. You have to actually think about the short time time scales to and the long time scales.",

So like, do you need, for example, let's say protein metabolism to happen inside the cell membrane or can that sort of happen outside and then, you know, and so it's hard to know where in the timing that all occurs because no one really knows the order of operations. And the other the other problem from a chemistry perspective is, you know, you look at the vast timeline of Earth and then in the lab you're basically zooming in in in on one little bit and you can do an experiment, but even if you look at the whole origin of life, which is a blip geologically, then even then you're zooming in super thin. And so any experiment that anyone's doing is going to be like this much and then you have to come back out and then you have to come back in at a different point to do the next experiment because it's not it's not just not possible for one person or lab to do the whole origin of life because you have to the time scale just doesn't make sense. Like how many chemical reactions can happen in months or a thesis time or something like that. So this is why we all work on different reactions, but they all have to connect conceptually.",

You can't make a long strand of RNA from simple molecules. Um, we can do kind of the pieces like she's talking about where we can make monomers and we can assemble monomers, but we don't have all that working together. We can't make, you know, liposomes. We don't have a cell cycle working. So all those are kind of unsolved problems. So I think to the extent that, you know, geochemistry can help with that, that could be really impactful too.",

So maybe the first one is like how long, you know, do those uh, you know, biomolecules to form, right? You know, under specific conditions. And the second question is how stable those molecules can be, right? Maybe the cells protiles, you know, maybe uh over like millions of years for for example. I think there are two processes and they could be like competing process as well, right? Maybe like they're forming the organics, but they're also degrading at the same time.",
