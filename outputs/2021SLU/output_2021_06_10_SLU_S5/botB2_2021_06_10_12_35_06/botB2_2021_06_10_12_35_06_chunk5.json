Um and then there could be a completely dead geologically dead planet and so I think there's really a whole a whole range of those and of course a planet can pass through those regimes in time. So I think it's pretty much wide open in terms of I mean it's hard to pin down it's going to be like this right? Um I think it could be all of those things whether a planet has like surface water and exposed land may be a little bit more specific and maybe that is limited in time I don't know.

So then he has to like derive it from the molecule and this takes them a really long time. And then the other issue was it was equilibrium modeling and our experiments not in equilibrium and also the modeling would tell us stability of a product at a condition but it didn't take into account the instability of the molecule like we were talking about. And so there was nowhere in the model to input the fact that like this molecule degrades at a well known exponential curve that we see in the lab but that's not included in the model.",

Uh and sometimes you can easily ignore some parameters like maybe like water content um and maybe like the pressure for instance and uh speciation of the organic molecules with the metal ions. Um so I I think the question is you know how do we figure out what are the key parameters going to use for those models to make like you know more accurate predictions right? And also like for I think for you know those organic molecules in those uh um environments like the minerals rocks right they definitely play an important role there. I think for most of the chemical models like for the organic speciation calculations uh they do not have the minerals components right in those calculations.

And in the lab too you find out that things are just very messy when you start involving geology and so like if you I don't know have a reaction driven by ferrous iron and the ocean had ferrous iron and then you do your with and without salt controls you then find out that there's a different rate when you have 0.5 molar of sodium chloride and on and on it goes. And it's like this for silica phosphorus nitrogen and so you end up having to do just an infinite amount of experiments to really understand what's going on and I don't know if the models are able to predict these things or if maybe just more modeling needs to be done before we do the experiment. But we often get tied up in controls like endless controls just to know because you can't just say the earlier ocean favors formation of molecule you have to do every component of that in the lab and and we just it takes forever.",

Particularly because what for example Laurie just shared with us about this particular problem is usually stuff that we never publish. I mean how do you publish a failed experiment which you can even say well you know I was to blame for it failing you know so how do you But it's so valuable because then somebody else looks at that and says oh but I think I know how I can improve this.
