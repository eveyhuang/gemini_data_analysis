I wonder if you could like expand on UV from like your lab perspective, um, because I, you know, do a lot of observations and trying to measure UV in astronomical settings. So I was curious kind of like what you use as model constraints and like what you'd like to have that would be better.",

Um, uh, I guess thinking about it in terms of Mars, which is probably the non-terran body that we think about the most. Um, you know, there are measurements of what's thought to be ancient Mars UV flux and current Mars UV flux based on changes in the atmosphere and the sun. Um, and there are measurements from Dimitar for instance and other labs where they've looked at um, uh, the impact of this on nucleo bases and it can be pretty profound. Um, especially with hard UV, um, you know, it can just degrade the nucleo bases and basically chew them up into smaller molecules or in kind of the more benign uh UVB UVC range, um, you can start to see things like for instance if you have a strand of DNA and if there's two Ts next to each other, there's a reaction that's UV promoted where it'll actually cross link those into a dimer. So all that stuff is going on and that UV that uh UV induced dimer formation that actually happens in living things right now. That's one of the main things that uh repair enzymes have to deal with. So it um that's just kind of what we think about as UV is generally chewing this stuff up and it can cause photochemical reactions that we don't want. That said, um, you know, there's been some work using UV as kind of a plus because it can, you know, you can photochemically promote some of these uh syntheses. But for the most part, uh we kind of think of it as a problem, you know, like assume that we get to the point where we have these monomers because like I said, we kind of live in this space where it's, you know, assume for the sake of argument that we have these molecules, what's going to happen in terms of their assembly, UV is a problem that we always have to deal with. So that's kind of how we think about it.",

Yeah. of course, the UV, the short wavelength radiation is very important because it provides the energy, basically the strong energy for the chemistry in atmosphere. So actually I want to uh explore the problem from maybe from a different perspective. I think the currently the temperature determination of the exoplanets basically based on the spectral, the infrared spectral or maybe maybe the distance from the mother star, something like that to estimate the temperature. I think maybe there are some other way to better, you know, determine the temperature. I mean the surface temperature, not the temperature on the top. Basically if you get the infrared spectrometer get the infrared spectral of the planet, basically you get the temperature, we call the brightness temperature.

The temperature, the daytime temperature and light time light time temperature, the difference can reach a couple of hundred degrees. So for for for but if the planet have have atmosphere, so you can check the temperature on the top of atmosphere.

But by my point, even for the planets in our solar system, even for the planets and moons in our solar system, we don't have determine very well the surface temperature. You know, because so uh of course we have some you know in situ measurements for the mass surface temperature. But if you check the global, I mean global scale temperature, that's other problem.
