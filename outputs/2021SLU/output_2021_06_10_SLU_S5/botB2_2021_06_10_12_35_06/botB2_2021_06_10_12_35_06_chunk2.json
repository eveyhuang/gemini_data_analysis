So it's my great pleasure to be here. I'm really looking forward to collaborating and learning from all of you. Thank you.",

So we have astronomers, planetary scientists, micro biologist and chemists and geochemists. So we'll have to I'll keep track of not using too much jargon. So I may be annoying from time to time and asking you to tell me what it means because usually I'm the one who doesn't know, but it may help some other people too. So before we start the discussions, um let's take that minute of silence or minute in which we can all write down or think about what is an important or are important questions to discuss in the topic of this group. And this group's topic is quite deep and broad, so there may be all kind of different ways to think of what is the most important. So I'll count a minute about a minute. So why don't we start now?",

So my kind of question for this is if if the main goal of this dialogue is how to find and you know, how to go about finding if there is life beyond earth, why is this topic about the necessary and sufficient conditions for life even relevant at all? Like why even discuss this? So I think Tim Lyons kind of started answering that question, but you know, we have to think about, you know, what are the connections? Maybe that's actually about the complementarity between exoplanet research and origin of life science.",

            "transcript": "So I have just a few bullet points and um honestly this might be helpful or will be helpful for me because I think that um and uh the the way that I think about this I know isn't the way that you think about it. So just getting into it quickly the the few things I had written down is that um you know, this this kind of comes directly from the questions but water, you know, we think of it as so central to life, but like it's worth considering other solvents, you know, like if we're thinking about Titan or methane or other things like that and I think that per Dimitar's comment about um, you know, how is this even relevant to life on earth? I think that the other solvent question could be relevant to life on earth because, you know, from some of uh for instance like Nick Hud's work, uh there's been work on kind of hypersaline environments and alternative solvents that come from a lot of solute from an aqueous solution that when you concentrate it, you have something that's still liquid that you can do interesting chemistry in. Um the third and there's five here just so you know where I am on this. um is uh, you know, thinking about prebiotic chemistry. I think we think of it as something that happened and then there was life, but I think that it's worth considering it as we I think of these questions as kind of a progress bar for the emergence of life, you know, we go from low complexity to kind of what Dimitar was talking about higher complexity. Um and I think that that might kind of inform some of our thinking about, you know, we're talking about with exoplanets. Uh and then finally the last two are kind of related. Um there's going to obviously be some geochemical constraints on what kind of protobiomolecules emerge and that's going to vary from body to body. Um and this is going to have uh, you know, impacts from a chemical perspective in terms of, you know, what surfaces are presented and what kind of chemistry you can do on those surfaces as well as and this kind of ties into the geochemistry, um, you know, temperature and pressure. I think that there are environments that are close enough to an earthlike environment where the chemistry could be quite similar, you know, like Mars, you're at, you know, a few millibar. I think most of the same stuff can be done there, but if you're thinking about a high pressure environment, that can have pretty profound effects on folding of biopolymers and there's been experiments done with that. So those are the few things that came to mind for me. Um and uh I'm definitely interested in hearing uh what everyone else has to say about this.",
