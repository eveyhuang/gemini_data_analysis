Um, I'll run through these real quick and please correct me. Um, one is this yeah, the idea of like um, ratios of elements, how universal those could be. Interesting links between analog environments and experimentation. That's number one. Number two, um, are perhaps uh, over focus on oxygen in the past, um, and maybe looking at different elements or nutrients. Um, this idea of meteorites as net positive or net negative impacts in general. Uh, and then maybe I think we've come back to this a couple times of like structure, compartmentalization, um, if it's necessary, if it's diagnostic um, in terms of complexity.

It got my the wheels turning in my head. Um, I wanted to also bring up that obviously compartmentalization is important, you know, for like concentrating materials and things like that, you know, for like protection, things like that. But I'm also thinking about the activity of water within this within that compartment, right? And so, you know, we we think of cells as bags of water, but the water in the in the cell is actually not as free flowing as it would be like elsewhere, right? And there's it's a cell is so concentrated with materials that like the medium it is it you know, it it like it's not like normal water in a sense, right? And so I'm wondering if there would be a way to like and and maybe people have done this already and I I just haven't seen that literature. Um, but kind of like studied um, like different water activities and like some of these like basic like basic processes and and seeing how that influences um, you know, like like like simple like metabolism like reactions, things like that. I is there literature on that? Does anyone is anyone familiar with that? I'm not sure.",
