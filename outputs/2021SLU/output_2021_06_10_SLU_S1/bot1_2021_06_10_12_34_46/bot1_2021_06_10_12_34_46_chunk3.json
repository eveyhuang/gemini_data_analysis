Um, and so one thing I've been thinking of about ever since Vicky and um Tim's talk this morning was, you know, can we try to get a better handle on the nutrient availability through Earth's history, how would that have affected the evolution of life over time? Um, and how would that have affected the amount of primary productivity going on in early Earth as a bioinformatician, I'm thinking of course, how can I look at the data that we have now to try to recreate what were the limiting nutrients um at different periods in Earth history. We can look at modern microbial um communities and get a sense of what limiting nutrients are based on pan genomes um and looking at what the gene content looks like. And so I've been thinking about can we apply that to the deep past to try to get a sense of what the limiting nutrients might have been because when we're thinking about biosignatures, it all comes down to fluxes, you know, of these gases that are emerging. And if we don't know how much life there was and like how limiting nutrients affected primary productivity, we're not going to get at that flux problem. So that's what I've been thinking about.",

You have actual empirical records of it and then you you have of course record in in life itself of of what would be limiting the scope of the of the biosphere.",

So I wonder along whether or not it's universal, um, do we can we connect this to the type of star that the planet will host or that will host a planet and where it is, how big it is, is it a moon? Um, I mean, I think that there are lots and does it move, right? Because I think that we we now understand that planets don't stay where they were born, they move around. So there is a lot of um, there's a lot of changes that are imposed from the outside that I wonder how they um, how they translate into processes within the planet.",

Um, so I know that there is a catalog out there of star composition, but my understanding is that that doesn't isn't necessarily reflected in the composition the planets like orbiting that star. So then how might you constrain like the elemental composition of those planets to relate it back to sort of nutrient availability that folks earlier in the conversation were talking about.",

So there are some evidence that show that um metallicity, loosely speaking in the in astronomy that connect to uh how how much abundance of metals there are in a star um is may be um correlated with the existence of hot Jupiters or Jupiters in general. Uh but for rocky planets, it's not so clear if there is a correlation. Um, I think I think it's hard to figure this out.

Um, there are lots of works that try to estimate how rocky something is and then by proxy you can say, you know, we need I mean, in order to be very rocky, you need some uh some at least some metals at least.
