Uh and I think in our field we've just really focused on the on the oxygen one, it's been kind of the holy grail of precambrian geology for so long and we we haven't really focused on on these other things that are critically important for organisms. And so um I don't know how to how to put them into to detection elsewhere. Um maybe I mean phosphorus I imagine is is difficult to track. Uh temperature potentially a little um a little little better easier to track. Um",

You know, again, even like astronomers tend to focus on the availability of liquid water. But I'm hearing you guys identify, you know, the the requirements for different elements. And um so you can really expand the characterization of the habitability of the environment, which really then sets the stage for maybe like target selection for, you know, looking for evidence of life. So you first have to characterize the habitability and and think about it in a more in a broader sense and then, you know, focus a little bit more on on life detection. Um",

So we can have um tidal effects that will contribute to this. So that puts into play exomoons, for example, if there is a moon very near uh you know, orbiting a a giant planet that can be very near a giant planet and can be an interesting thing. Um and also the environment itself. So not necessarily, I mean, there is a prediction of a lot of free floating planets that usually people think that are completely not interesting, but if this free floating planet isn't actually a very dense area, um and there are lots of stars around, you know, overall it gets uh the temperature that it needs. That's a very extreme place. I don't know if people are interested in that at all, but I'm trying to be very if you notice because I'm so out of the field of all of you guys, so I'm trying to push a lot. I hope it's okay.",

So it can happen it depends it depends first on our our our uncertainty of exactly how tides work. It also depends what is forcing the the migration, right? So if I'm moving a system from uh two orders of magnitude in semi major axis, like we're thinking that how Jupiters are moving around to become hot Jupiters, imagine that Jupiter has a moon with it, the entire system is moving and changing the energy by two orders of magnitude.",

Yes, yeah, the 10 million years is very fast. Thank you. And um and if we're thinking about the free floating, so I just threw this because I'm thinking in the galactic center, like our own galactic center, um we know that there are lots of young stars and those young stars maybe have proto planetary discs and maybe they also created planets, but it's such a dense place that maybe lots of planets are just free floating, but there's such a nice flux that come from all the right it's a one parsec radius with about million stars. So our nearest star is one parsec away. So it's like a huge dense volume.",

For example, Earth consists if I'm not mistaken mostly of iron. You would think, oh, there's lots of iron, no way life would be iron limited ever anywhere on Earth, but uh but really what matters to life is not what's at the core of the planet but what's at the at the surface and that's not necessarily the same as the average composition of the planet as a whole. So I think it's also important to keep in mind the the difference between the average, most of which will perhaps be inaccessible to life and and the the surface.",
