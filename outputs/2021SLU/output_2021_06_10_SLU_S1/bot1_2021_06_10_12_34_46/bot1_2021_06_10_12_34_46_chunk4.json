            "transcript": "I think if we think about the redfield ratio in early earth, we it may be difficult to to predict in the sense that what we know today is oxygenated world and for example in the case of phosphorus, most organisms will assimilate phosphate and it was pretty rare on early earth when there was no oxygen, so we need to start looking into organisms that uh survive or make their living in um reduced environments. So we need to also think about environments that will be similar to early earth to go pick up those redfield ratios to make prediction and not necessarily in the open ocean today for example or uh other type of uh environment that are not representative of this early earth. So I think thinking of both the microbes, their processes but also their environments, everything is tied together which is also a difficulty because uh part of it is can you mimic that in the lab and uh how can how much can you simplify without losing important components that would uh artificially drive your results towards uh the wrong answer.",

Uh so so even that could be that requirement might be challenged. Uh I'm not sure how how long such life forms would would would be competitive against the ones that actually are able to form micro environments. Um but yeah, just wanted to bring that up in this context. Uh regarding the redfield ratio type question. I I I I uploaded a couple papers on the crowd sourcing folder uh because I find them representative of the general literature that shows that life is quite adaptive uh in terms of its uh elemental composition when needed. Uh one is Gold 4 2017 and they they they used ancestral reconstruction of pathways and and metabolic networks to argue that ancient metabolism was able to do without phosphate uh when when phosphate was limiting.",
