            "timestamp": "00:23-04:27",
            "transcript": "Yeah, um, I mean I I can't really speak too much about like like outside of our solar system. I'm I'm not as familiar with a lot of that a lot of those kind of studies. Um, in terms of the meteorite composition that we've measured just from falls on earth and then, you know, for example, like some of the ongoing work that they're doing like with the sample recovery at Benu and things like that. Like I I would expect well, um, I mean the the the and just going back to amino acids just because it's a it's a good example. Um, but this could I'm sure this applies to a lot of other organic building blocks. Um, you know, the the the the history of like a meteorite in terms of, you know, like heating and um, like melting of ice and like those those those processing cycles really can play a big role in terms of the organics that we detect, right? And so, you know, like for example, um, like all the the amino acids in our proteins are um have like an alpha carbon, right? But there are different structural isomers of amino acids and in some amino acids, you know, like like ones that have longer carbon chains are like much way more upregulated than others, right? Um, the for example like Murchison one of the reasons why that caught so much attention one one it was like really the first study but also a lot of the like alpha amino acids that we use in our proteins um are pretty upregulated in that one relative to some of the other structural isomers. But there are other there are other meteorites where it's like the complete opposite, right? And so they the like the history of those in terms of their kind of weathering and and things like like melting cycles, things like that is really plays a huge role in the content, the organic content that we detect. I also wanted to related to that. I wanted to mention um um uh smarter is it is that right? You you brought up um, you know, like deliver like net delivery versus um destruction, right? And an issue with that just experimentally like on on more like like experimental side is, you know, even if, you know, even if we do collect, you know, like a lot of a lot of meteorite on earth and we're, you know, we take it to our lab, the just the sample preparation that we perform to so that we can do organic analysis, you know, sometimes that actually could break down some of the more complex um organics that were present in there and we actually can't see them because just by just in order to extract them, you know, we have to use like really strong acid and things like that. And so, um it it could be it can there there are a lot of layers of complexity there. Um and also I I think it's important to note too that a lot of the analytical instrumentation that we send on like uh extraterrestrial rovers and things like that is quite limited compared to the instruments that we can we can use like here on earth. just because there's so many other factors that go into play, you know, you can't just, you know, you have to think about like like power requirements and weight and all these other things, right? And so, you know, like like uh, you know, one of the mass spectrometers in my research lab, you know, it's like 20 years old and it's like way out of date compared to a lot of a lot of other labs here on earth, but it's like the the the the analytical power that is actually much higher than like what's probably on these rovers that's going to like Mars and things like that, right? And so there are all these things that we have to consider which is why I'm really excited about Benu because I think that the ability for sample return is is huge. I think that that's massive. And uh I'm really excited to see what that study unfolds because I think that we'll be able to do a lot more in depth analysis of the organic content from than we can from what we're sending out elsewhere and it's not that that that stuff isn't important. It's obviously super important but there's just practically speaking there's a lot of difficulties that go into developing instrumentation for something like like a rover.",

So um we have Benu and then there's also Mars sample return and hopefully we see the completion of of that as well. Um just to kind of push so you guys have have covered a lot of ground um thinking a lot about um elemental requirements, habitability, delivery of these prebiotic compounds. Um maybe start to think about like what what are some projects that you might propose that are relevant to life detection. It could be relevant to Mars, could be relevant to ocean worlds, uh could be relevant to exoplanets.",
