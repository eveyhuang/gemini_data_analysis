Uh the first question I thought of here in this context was um and and I think they're kind of related is about um what kind of life we actually expect to see statistically speaking. It seems that there's a strong focus on on very basic life forms if you want primitive kind of similar to the unicellular life we we have on earth, uh microbial life. Uh but do we actually have a good understanding of what the probability would be for life on a planet on which life has evolved? What's the probability for that life to have reached levels of complexity that would generate macro structures that we can look for like like forests for example or or colonies or biofilms and so on. So I mean we know how long it took for life on earth to reach that transition to that upper level of complexity, but do we have reasons to believe that perhaps it could take less time or or more time on other planets um and and how hopeful can we be to to encounter such macro structures.",
