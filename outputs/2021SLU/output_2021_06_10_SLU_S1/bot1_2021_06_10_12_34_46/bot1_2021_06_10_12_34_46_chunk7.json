I mean they're going to be underground, so maybe there's no methods available right now.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I can just kind of help address that, move it along. Um, so rather than oil, you can also think about kerogen, um, which is a more solid form of a carbon it's it's a very complex thing. Um, certainly like it's preserved in ancient rocks on earth, but there is evidence that there is kerogenous type material on Mars. Um, biotic or abiotic, who knows, but you know, it's and Jay can correct me here. Um, my understanding is that there's kerogen within meteorites as well. So any any organic compounds being formed in a meteorite or other parent body can form kerogen. So the challenge then is um distinguishing biotic kerogen from abiotic kerogen. Um, in terms of uh, you know, drilling, you know, in terms of Mars, you can really go down like a meter. There are some platforms being developed um with drills, but it's it's fairly short. But what you can do instead is go to areas where ancient rocks are exposed, um recently exposed. So you can look at meter um craters, you know, impacts, things where things have um areas where things have been excavated. Um, so it's it is a possibility to look for that. Um, but again, it might be difficult uh to put it in the in the framework that Vicky was talking about assessing false positives.",

So it's just one question I think is exciting and and I don't think we we really know anything about like how many other trials did evolution make in terms of rise increasing complexity discretely and then they these other attempts just were out competed and faded out.
