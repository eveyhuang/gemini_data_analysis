I started off as an earth system scientist working on some of the same questions that Tim was talking about this morning. Um doing atmospheric and photochemical modeling of Earth's early atmosphere to say we could explain those signatures and what it would imply for the the environment at the time. Um, but the last 10 years or so I've been using those that sort of same toolkit, Earth system science thinking about what life was like on earliest Earth and uh and photochemistry to understand biosignatures on exoplanets specifically. Um and and now I'm in a holding pattern with a lot of the exoplanet community waiting to hear a lot of the astronomy community waiting to hear what the Astro 2020 decadal survey is going to recommend. Um, because if it gives us one of the exoplanet direct imaging flagships that's probably where I'll be spending most of my time the rest of my career. So we'll see. Big big month or two coming up or big day coming up sometime in the next two months unknown what date it'll be. Um.",

I and it came up in in a number of different ways earlier is this idea of the interpretive framework and that's what's so embracing about this field is that it requires all of us. And so in the coming years we're going to have wonderful compositional information about atmospheres around exoplanets and we may even have temporal variation. We'll have a lot of information but what earth has told us is that it is really difficult to interpret those those signals.",

If you found something of your dreams around an exoplanet or on Mars or associated with an icy moon, what would it be and how would it instill the confidence that you need to go to the New York Times and say life found elsewhere. Um and we're a long way from that to be honest. We've been working a long time and and and one of the things that always strikes me is the incredible sophistication as I hear you all speak whether it's computational experimental uh empirical, the things that we're bringing to bear on this but at the end of the day the observations are going to be pretty simple. There's going to be oxygen or not oxygen, methane or not methane in tandem or not. Um the Mars question are are we ever going to find a preserved organic molecule on Mars that unambiguously is tied to life. And so how do we take these what will always be pretty simple observations.",

Um, you know, one of the things when we were in the NAI we were always asked to talk about mission relevance, mission specificity. And so as you talk about your ideal, um, it it would be great if some of you could also talk about what would that mission be. So for the last discussion is that flying through a plume and sampling. Uh what what, you know, it's ultimately about deliverables. I think this community really needs it always has but increasingly need to focus on beyond sort of the theoretical and the ideal what can we do in the foreseeable future and feel pretty good about what we're finding.",

So there are a lot of layers here that one needs to connect and I'm not sure if the the complexity of the planetary chemistry alone is an indicator of life given that molecules can form and then degrade at the same rate. But going back to Tim Tim's uh point, um I wouldn't I I guess what I would like to see is almost like this, you know, the so devices that you see on Star Trek that sort of interpretive device for for biosignatures. I sort of develop an algorithm or a um sort of a quantification of biosignatures that will allow us to uh understand whether uh there's possibility of what we see will generate life or not at first place.",
