The challenging thing will be I I don't think there's any I I I realistically don't think there's a standard that we're going to be able to meet where we know for certain that we're at that moment when that press conference happens. I think it's almost certainly going to be we found something interesting, we think it is life, we're comfortable saying it it is in a paper, but like the real test is going to be whether or not that discovery holds up 50 years later after a bunch of postdocs and grad students question and we probably send a follow up mission to wherever we thought we found it. Um, so I think like that that both means that I don't think we should ever hold ourselves to the standard that like it has to be either absolutely we found it or like let's not do it. It can be part of some progressive build up of a case and also it it thinking of it that way is like the start of a longer term investigation opens up some longer term studies of a planet. You know, we one mission as G pointed out in the chat's only going to cover five to 10 years, maybe 20. Um, but it's probably not the last mission we would send especially if we saw something interesting. So, you know, this could be a century's long experiment that just starts up just like any form of of exploration or or observation.",

            "transcript": "Let me just layer on that before we go to the hands because I think that's exactly right and that's what often comes up in conversations when I press people. They say if we find O2 around a planet that's not around an M star where it's easy to attribute to to false positives, O2 around a terrestrial planet in a habitable zone around a G star, that's a headline in its own regard. That's going to be really, really exciting. And the knack or the trick for us is to be able to present that as a huge step forward without being definitive proof. I think that's not that hard to do. The other thing also the techno signature discussion is is really interesting. There are people who argue against that because if you look at our own planet, that's 60 years of 4.1 billion years of life history. Um, and when I query audiences about whether they'd be excited if we discover methane around a planet that within 90% certainty is related to biology, would they be excited and they always say yes. They always say yes. So I think, you know, the world is primed for anything that's somewhat convincing. Should we let's go to hands. I don't know who's next.",

If you if you if you pin down one confidence statement that says we should all be looking at this planet in this particular direction at the same time, um, I think that's the way to kind of create impact is to then push our resources at least to a a viable target where we had none. Um, so maybe that's the way to think about the New York Times is to say, look, now we at least have a point a direction to point. Um, and that's kind of how like the the uh black hole collisions what was done, right? They they had a position to point and they they were able to see it.",

Where my mind went is this kind of older idea of these spatial distributions of microbes. Well, where my mind went first is trees and whether we could look at trees and imagine that sort of the patterning that you get on the surface based on those sort of larger scale biological relationships.",

And so we're talking about detectability across a range of spatial and sometimes temporal scales. Um, and so what I was bringing up in the in the chat was this idea of these reticulated structures um and particularly in places like caves and in the subsurface where we don't have photosynthesis happening, um, something one thing we do still get is this weird organization, like spatial organization of biomass and other kinds of signatures um in terms of Amanda brought on the idea of like, you know, what what sorts of element and um sort of polymer signatures are correlative to those spatial distributions.",

Um, well so uh trying to keep things practical and um, you know, I think we all realize that context is important. Um, but some signatures arguably the more specific ones or telltale ones are the ones that we provide more confidence that there is life depend less on context than others. Um, if you think about like uh micro carbon to the fossil looking uh thing in the in the record or um an atmospheric makeup all the way to a techno signature, right? And so your likelihood of getting a more specific clue kind of decreases um as as the as the clue is more telltale, I guess. Um, and so one, you know, one approach to to build up confidence over time, it could be partly within a single effort, a single mission, but but more likely with a a string of missions um is to kind of build a strategy up front, I guess and look for the more gen the things that you're more likely to find first and then um if you find them then, right? So you can I mean, one way you could do this all at the same time is say with a simple return mission, I guess, because then you have all the you can integrate the sample and adapt to what you find and so on. Otherwise you're probably bound to to waiting for for the additional phase of investigation. Um,",
