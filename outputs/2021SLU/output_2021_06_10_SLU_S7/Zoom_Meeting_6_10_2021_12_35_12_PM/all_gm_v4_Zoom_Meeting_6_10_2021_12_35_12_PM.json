Uh, I'm an assistant professor at the University of Arizona, um, and between the cell biology, astronomy and Lunar and Planetary Labs. Um, so it's pretty astrobiology by by design, really.

And uh, and and relevant to this meeting, we're interested in understanding early life biosignatures. So we use different tools. My background is in biochemistry and evolutionary systems biology and a lot of synthetic biology. So we design artificial systems to understand the possibilities or what what life could have been that wasn't um, and uh I think really what we're trying to get at eventually is to understand the early Earth biosignatures to answer this question of how do we increase our confidence in uh that that we have detected life. So that goes back to uh what also Tim was talking about, the sort of interpretive context of once we detect these signals, how do we know that we found life uh and and then where do we uh in sort of knowing when to stop, we want to know how far we can go in connecting it to life. I'm also uh leading one of the newly selected NASA I cars, uh that's that's called Muse. It's we will be looking at the natural selection of elements over geologic time.

Um, but the last 10 years or so I've been using those that sort of same toolkit, Earth system science thinking about what life was like on earliest Earth and uh and photochemistry to understand biosignatures on exoplanets specifically. Um and and now I'm in a holding pattern with a lot of the exoplanet community waiting to hear a lot of the astronomy community waiting to hear what the Astro 2020 decadal survey is going to recommend. Um, because if it gives us one of the exoplanet direct imaging flagships that's probably where I'll be spending most of my time the rest of my career. So we'll see.

There's going to be oxygen or not oxygen, methane or not methane in tandem or not.

Like certainly bio molecules or bio polymers are an important product of life, but I wonder like something simple like if we put an observation out in space and looked at Earth, could we see signatures of like predator prey behavior, right? Where you, you know, in a local ecosystem, can you say, oh, look, there's a group of trees that are killing the other trees and then they oscillate. You know, there there are these kind of ecosystem signatures. I don't know much about them because I'm not an expert in ecosystems, but I would say you want to correlate something like a predator prey observation with then some other kind of, you know, micro scale signatures of that type of thing.

The challenging thing will be I I don't think there's any I I I realistically don't think there's a standard that we're going to be able to meet where we know for certain that we're at that moment when that press conference happens. I think it's almost certainly going to be we found something interesting, we think it is life, we're comfortable saying it it is in a paper, but like the real test is going to be whether or not that discovery holds up 50 years later after a bunch of postdocs and grad students question and we probably send a follow up mission to wherever we thought we found it. Um, so I think like that that both means that I don't think we should ever hold ourselves to the standard that like it has to be either absolutely we found it or like let's not do it. It can be part of some progressive build up of a case and also it it thinking of it that way is like the start of a longer term investigation opens up some longer term studies of a planet. You know, we one mission as G pointed out in the chat's only going to cover five to 10 years, maybe 20. Um, but it's probably not the last mission we would send especially if we saw something interesting.

That's going to be really, really exciting. And the knack or the trick for us is to be able to present that as a huge step forward without being definitive proof. I think that's not that hard to do. The other thing also the techno signature discussion is is really interesting. There are people who argue against that because if you look at our own planet, that's 60 years of 4.1 billion years of life history. Um, and when I query audiences about whether they'd be excited if we discover methane around a planet that within 90% certainty is related to biology, would they be excited and they always say yes. They always say yes. So I think, you know, the world is primed for anything that's somewhat convincing. Should we let's go to hands. I don't know who's next.",

And so we're talking about detectability across a range of spatial and sometimes temporal scales. Um, and so what I was bringing up in the in the chat was this idea of these reticulated structures um and particularly in places like caves and in the subsurface where we don't have photosynthesis happening, um, something one thing we do still get is this weird organization, like spatial organization of biomass and other kinds of signatures um in terms of Amanda brought on the idea of like, you know, what what sorts of element and um sort of polymer signatures are correlative to those spatial distributions.",

Um, if you think about like uh micro carbon to the fossil looking uh thing in the in the record or um an atmospheric makeup all the way to a techno signature, right? And so your likelihood of getting a more specific clue kind of decreases um as as the as the clue is more telltale, I guess. Um, and so one, you know, one approach to to build up confidence over time, it could be partly within a single effort, a single mission, but but more likely with a a string of missions um is to kind of build a strategy up front, I guess and look for the more gen the things that you're more likely to find first and then um if you find them then, right? So you can I mean, one way you could do this all at the same time is say with a simple return mission, I guess, because then you have all the you can integrate the sample and adapt to what you find and so on.

For first first of all is this the exoplanet versus planetary system, right? When planetary scientists talk about biosignature, you tend to talk about uh sample return in C2 measurement. When we talk about biosignature, we talk about atmospheric biosignature, for example, O2 and CH4. That's all that we can do even with a futuristic mission two decades from now. So is there a converging point between exoplanet and planetary scientists like to, you know, or or this is impractical. We make we're we're basically living in our own words and without um, you know, worry about each other. Okay, that's the first contention. And the second contention contention is is that uh the techno techno signature versus uh traditional or conventional biosignature, right? Um, I teach life in universe. When I when I talk about techno signature and one critics that I I have to I have for this field is that if you see something, then that doesn't really tells you the statistics or the origin of that technical. Like you're really missing the step from like the emergence of life to the the civilization, right? But if you do this conventional biosignature search, that could potentially tells you how life build up over time and eventually reach civilization. So which route do we take? Uh, that's another thing to debate. Just, you know, throw out my my my my thought here.",

For example, if you talk about earth at a 10 parsec in astronomy terms, it's magnitude is 30's magnitude. So if you have a 10 meter telescope or, you know, even bigger telescope, it takes an hour to get a decent SNR, right? And if you want to increase the spatial resolution, you can use, you know, uh high um like long baseline interferometry, which will be demonstrated by Lisa. So by the time we talk about this mission, I think this technological difficulty will be retired. So the I mean, it's it's not that hard to achieve 20 pixel uh resolution on the on the planet.",

Um, and that's because a lot of that signal is controlled for CO2 in particular by uh the asymmetry of our continent distribution and terrestrial biomass. Plants and grasses on northern continents. So, you know, there's not all hope lost by by single pixel, but it still requires temporal resolution and probably requires direct imaging. Uh, you know, it's already an advanced level of technology, but but it's uh, but it's doable. But I think this question of what you would do with 20 pixels is really interesting, right? So you would see maybe equatorial continental margin production, the sorts of things that life do, you can impose a upwelling model. You know, nutrients are core understanding critical piece of all of this and so you can start thinking about the physical processes in a distant ocean and how that would control the distribution of life.

And so there's sort of a natural tendency towards clumping. Um, and so that's sort of the premise behind these biovermiculations where it's like even if you just let microbes be on a rock, they're going to sort of aggregate and you're going to have different zones that are doing different things. Um, and so I think I think that is a tendency that is scalable, you know, when we think about different landscapes and different sort of plant ecosystems and different kind of animal ecosystems, you know, there is patchiness in a way to all of it um that may be decidedly less structured than what you might get abiotically.

I even think the question of is there life on Europa versus Enceladus is in some astrobiological context asking two very different questions about, you know, is water enough or do you really need rock water interaction for example if there's not that occurring as bigger saying in as it is in Europa. But Enceladus is an easier place to get. So you you take that difference and you expand it to Venus and Mars and exoplanets and a variety of exoplanets. Now you're really getting at comparative what I call comparative astrobiology, not just comparative planetology which is what we've been doing the last, you know, few decades. Um and that's fun.
