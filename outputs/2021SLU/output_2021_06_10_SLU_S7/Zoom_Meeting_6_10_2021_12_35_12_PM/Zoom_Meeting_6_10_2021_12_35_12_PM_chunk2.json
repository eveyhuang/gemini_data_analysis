And we've had a couple of impactful papers where we have what I what I really pursue are are are general models that are predictive. I like the idea that in physics, I think physicists tend to like the idea that we can make a model that predicts something. And so when I think about biosignatures, I don't know that it's possible, but I dream of something that I could say, here's a predictive model that if there's higher photosynthetic life on that planet, this is what you would see, A B C D and E, right?",

Uh, I'm an assistant professor at the University of Arizona, um, and between the cell biology, astronomy and Lunar and Planetary Labs. Um, so it's pretty astrobiology by by design, really. And um, so we we do a lot of different things. We're interested in understanding the origin of life, but also early Earth, very earliest really evolution uh of of life. And uh, and and relevant to this meeting, we're interested in understanding early life biosignatures. So we use different tools. My background is in biochemistry and evolutionary systems biology and a lot of synthetic biology. So we design artificial systems to understand the possibilities or what what life could have been that wasn't um, and uh I think really what we're trying to get at eventually is to understand the early Earth biosignatures to answer this question of how do we increase our confidence in uh that that we have detected life. So that goes back to uh what also Tim was talking about, the sort of interpretive context of once we detect these signals, how do we know that we found life uh and and then where do we uh in sort of knowing when to stop, we want to know how far we can go in connecting it to life. I'm also uh leading one of the newly selected NASA I cars, uh that's that's called Muse. It's we will be looking at the natural selection of elements over geologic time. Uh, so there's a lot of biology, geology, astronomy, physics involved and I'm really excited uh to to you know, see where where this can go and find uh new ways of collaborating with this amazing community.

Um, she did a lot to help secure my position here and uh and the idea was that we would grow astrobiology and we were funded through the Astrobiology Institute and then through Icar and we are now Earth and planetary sciences uh and these are all things that you helped put in motion. If you don't know in addition to being Chancellor here, France went on to be president at Purdue and then the director of NSF. Um, so she has worn a number of different hats and has some great perspective in all of these discussions.",
