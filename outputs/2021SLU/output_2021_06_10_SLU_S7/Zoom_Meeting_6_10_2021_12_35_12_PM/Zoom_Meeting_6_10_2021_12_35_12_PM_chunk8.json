I think we discussed we covered actually a lot of stuff in different hierarchies of behavior or molecules to ecosystems. Um and I guess we didn't quite talk about how to connect them but good luck to us all because they all seem to have their own operate at their own, you know, have their own rules at each scale even though there are connections between them and what we observe eventually is a molecular phenomenon. So I like how Mark sort of set the tone and opened the conversation with molecules and um how then Nathaniel took it to ecosystem level and we've been sort of dancing between scales of what's happening between these two um ends.",

Right? I even think the question of is there life on Europa versus Enceladus is in some astrobiological context asking two very different questions about, you know, is water enough or do you really need rock water interaction for example if there's not that occurring as bigger saying in as it is in Europa. But Enceladus is an easier place to get. So you you take that difference and you expand it to Venus and Mars and exoplanets and a variety of exoplanets. Now you're really getting at comparative what I call comparative astrobiology, not just comparative planetology which is what we've been doing the last, you know, few decades. Um and that's fun. But I don't know exactly what we'll learn yet because we got to do the measurements first.",
