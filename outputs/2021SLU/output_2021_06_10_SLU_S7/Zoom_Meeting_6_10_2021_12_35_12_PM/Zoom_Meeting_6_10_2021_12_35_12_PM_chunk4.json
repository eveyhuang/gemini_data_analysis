And so I really like Mark's biopolymer idea, but I think then we also need to understand what the monomers are and look for that like like Batel said something about um complexity, but really what we're looking for like space science uh abiotic chemistry is very complex. We're looking for a reduction of that complexity to those few monomers that make those biopolymers. And so um sorry.",

Um my my sense is you know, I don't know, are any of you kind of specialists in ecosystems, right? I feel like there's kind of this multi scale approach. Like certainly bio molecules or bio polymers are an important product of life, but I wonder like something simple like if we put an observation out in space and looked at Earth, could we see signatures of like predator prey behavior, right? Where you, you know, in a local ecosystem, can you say, oh, look, there's a group of trees that are killing the other trees and then they oscillate. You know, there there are these kind of ecosystem signatures. I don't know much about them because I'm not an expert in ecosystems, but I would say you want to correlate something like a predator prey observation with then some other kind of, you know, micro scale signatures of that type of thing. But predator prey models I think can happen in non living systems also, but the point is multi kind of multi scale is is is a question that I would have.",
