Um so I'm thinking of Pluto before it was explored by New Horizons. Um you had you had these synthetic maps. It was a single pixel. Um but it's obliquity and you know, so you you had the rotation uh and then you because of the ubiquity you were able to get a map in 3D with the the intensity was uh or the albedo and the color. Uh and so there were maps made them I'm going to paste the link in the chat and um it was pretty pretty good. Um and very pretty comparable to what we're looking for with 20 pixels.

Um, I also I've been I've been Googling um, I think the word that that's used most commonly is biovermiculation.

You know, biological organisms they can just sit there and crank, but that's going to have an effect on the environment and on anything else they're interfacing with. And so there's sort of a natural tendency towards clumping. Um, and so that's sort of the premise behind these biovermiculations where it's like even if you just let microbes be on a rock, they're going to sort of aggregate and you're going to have different zones that are doing different things. Um, and so I think I think that is a tendency that is scalable, you know, when we think about different landscapes and different sort of plant ecosystems and different kind of animal ecosystems, you know, there is patchiness in a way to all of it um that may be decidedly less structured than what you might get abiotically. But I know far less about the abiotic end member and so I'm getting a little out there I guess, but I was told I was supposed to. So there you go.

Um, it turns out that it like chemical scales even in certain chemical reactions, you can basically play games with entropy where you take small kind of ratcheted steps to kind of gain negative entropy. Um, and there's some really interesting thermodynamics there that is obviously relevant to chemistry.
