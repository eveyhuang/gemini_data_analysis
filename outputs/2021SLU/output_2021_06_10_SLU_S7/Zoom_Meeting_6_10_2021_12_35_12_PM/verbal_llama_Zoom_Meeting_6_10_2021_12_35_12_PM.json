And uh, and and relevant to this meeting, we're interested in understanding early life biosignatures. So we use different tools. My background is in biochemistry and evolutionary systems biology and a lot of synthetic biology. So we design artificial systems to understand the possibilities or what what life could have been that wasn't um, and uh I think really what we're trying to get at eventually is to understand the early Earth biosignatures to answer this question of how do we increase our confidence in uh that that we have detected life.

Um, so I think like that that both means that I don't think we should ever hold ourselves to the standard that like it has to be either absolutely we found it or like let's not do it. It can be part of some progressive build up of a case and also it it thinking of it that way is like the start of a longer term investigation opens up some longer term studies of a planet. You know, we one mission as G pointed out in the chat's only going to cover five to 10 years, maybe 20.

So you would see maybe equatorial continental margin production, the sorts of things that life do, you can impose a upwelling model.
