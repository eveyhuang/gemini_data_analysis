My background is in biochemistry and evolutionary systems biology and a lot of synthetic biology. So we design artificial systems to understand the possibilities or what what life could have been that wasn't um, and uh I think really what we're trying to get at eventually is to understand the early Earth biosignatures to answer this question of how do we increase our confidence in uh that that we have detected life.

Like certainly bio molecules or bio polymers are an important product of life, but I wonder like something simple like if we put an observation out in space and looked at Earth, could we see signatures of like predator prey behavior, right?

You know, there there are these kind of ecosystem signatures. I don't know much about them because I'm not an expert in ecosystems, but I would say you want to correlate something like a predator prey observation with then some other kind of, you know, micro scale signatures of that type of thing.

Um, so I think like that that both means that I don't think we should ever hold ourselves to the standard that like it has to be either absolutely we found it or like let's not do it. It can be part of some progressive build up of a case and also it it thinking of it that way is like the start of a longer term investigation opens up some longer term studies of a planet. You know, we one mission as G pointed out in the chat's only going to cover five to 10 years, maybe 20.

That's going to be really, really exciting. And the knack or the trick for us is to be able to present that as a huge step forward without being definitive proof. I think that's not that hard to do. The other thing also the techno signature discussion is is really interesting. There are people who argue against that because if you look at our own planet, that's 60 years of 4.1 billion years of life history. Um, and when I query audiences about whether they'd be excited if we discover methane around a planet that within 90% certainty is related to biology, would they be excited and they always say yes.

Um, if you think about like uh micro carbon to the fossil looking uh thing in the in the record or um an atmospheric makeup all the way to a techno signature, right? And so your likelihood of getting a more specific clue kind of decreases um as as the as the clue is more telltale, I guess. Um, and so one, you know, one approach to to build up confidence over time, it could be partly within a single effort, a single mission, but but more likely with a a string of missions um is to kind of build a strategy up front, I guess and look for the more gen the things that you're more likely to find first and then um if you find them then, right?

Um, it turns out that it like chemical scales even in certain chemical reactions, you can basically play games with entropy where you take small kind of ratcheted steps to kind of gain negative entropy. Um, and there's some really interesting thermodynamics there that is obviously relevant to chemistry.

But Enceladus is an easier place to get. So you you take that difference and you expand it to Venus and Mars and exoplanets and a variety of exoplanets. Now you're really getting at comparative what I call comparative astrobiology, not just comparative planetology which is what we've been doing the last, you know, few decades. Um and that's fun.
