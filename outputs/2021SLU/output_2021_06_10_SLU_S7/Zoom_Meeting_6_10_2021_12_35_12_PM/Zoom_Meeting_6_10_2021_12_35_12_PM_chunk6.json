For first first of all is this the exoplanet versus planetary system, right? When planetary scientists talk about biosignature, you tend to talk about uh sample return in C2 measurement. When we talk about biosignature, we talk about atmospheric biosignature, for example, O2 and CH4. That's all that we can do even with a futuristic mission two decades from now. So is there a converging point between exoplanet and planetary scientists like to, you know, or or this is impractical. We make we're we're basically living in our own words and without um, you know, worry about each other. Okay, that's the first contention. And the second contention contention is is that uh the techno techno signature versus uh traditional or conventional biosignature, right? Um, I teach life in universe. When I when I talk about techno signature and one critics that I I have to I have for this field is that if you see something, then that doesn't really tells you the statistics or the origin of that technical. Like you're really missing the step from like the emergence of life to the the civilization, right? But if you do this conventional biosignature search, that could potentially tells you how life build up over time and eventually reach civilization. So which route do we take? Uh, that's another thing to debate. Just, you know, throw out my my my my thought here.",

The near term opportunity would be to get some degree of this by watching the planet over time. Um, spin underneath the telescope so to speak. Um, and if you get uh if you have a close enough target, you could do a short enough exposure time to to get snippets. And what you'd really be aiming for there is um the longitudinal uh variations of things. So you might be able to look for patterns of say um pigments associated with forests um at the longitudes that correlate with where you might have some, you know, like rainfall coming from off ocean currents.

Pigments would be a little bit harder and I and and there's there's a there's a back story here to a paper that didn't publish this, but we might be able to do pigments and map them out um longitudinally. People at at over coffee at um conferences have talked about being able to do it latitudinally as well um by looking if you've got a planet with a tilt by looking at that same thing as it goes through the orbit, you might be able to do something. It's probably not 20 pixels though. We're probably talking, you know, like 10 degrees of longitude or 10 10 to 20 degrees of latitude. Um, the other idea is for way and now that's what we could do if we get one of these flagship missions and we get the right target. We have to get lucky with the target.

For example, if you talk about earth at a 10 parsec in astronomy terms, it's magnitude is 30's magnitude. So if you have a 10 meter telescope or, you know, even bigger telescope, it takes an hour to get a decent SNR, right? And if you want to increase the spatial resolution, you can use, you know, uh high um like long baseline interferometry, which will be demonstrated by Lisa. So by the time we talk about this mission, I think this technological difficulty will be retired. So the I mean, it's it's not that hard to achieve 20 pixel uh resolution on the on the planet.",

Um, and that's because a lot of that signal is controlled for CO2 in particular by uh the asymmetry of our continent distribution and terrestrial biomass. Plants and grasses on northern continents. So, you know, there's not all hope lost by by single pixel, but it still requires temporal resolution and probably requires direct imaging. Uh, you know, it's already an advanced level of technology, but but it's uh, but it's doable. But I think this question of what you would do with 20 pixels is really interesting, right? So you would see maybe equatorial continental margin production, the sorts of things that life do, you can impose a upwelling model. You know, nutrients are core understanding critical piece of all of this and so you can start thinking about the physical processes in a distant ocean and how that would control the distribution of life.

Or or being able to differentiate, you know, ocean from from like you said, biomass. And and you know, like the the paper that I recently published in photosynthesis was a correlation between essentially this the solar spectrum and what color plants should be. And so if you had something like that where I could I could see a little patch of the planet rotating around of a certain color, um, then maybe you can start to dig a little bit deeper. And that's why I I think the question to me is let's say everything was perfect, would 21 pixels be enough? You know, like would would that give us a little step closer to to pinning some of these things down or or maybe the way Tim said it is, what would that afford, right? If we had 21",
