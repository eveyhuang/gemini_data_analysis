We could talk about or this gathering current this one uh that we could talk about molecules and how themselves are evolving.",

So that could be another nice conversation after this listening to this really nice in depth discussion on the geochemistry so it's actually kind of refreshing not to hear life ironically. Um and and just hear about the conditions um that may have enabled life. I guess I just keep thinking about the stochasticity of course in in these processes and and how how determinist they are physically and chemically.",

So anyone want to comment on the stochasticity of these things or how um general would they be across the universe uh what what you're describing or what are these setting parameters for these early planetary conditions to be in more universal than than not. Uh I would be happy to hear that. I'm getting some comments from uh Edwin and very very very useful uh on the early meteorites and how they could be also shaping uh the early planetary chemistry but I'm interested in hearing other thoughts.",

            "transcript": "one thing I've been thinking about is when we talk about cycling in terms of systems that are important or necessary for you know the establishment of a biosphere. There are parts of cycling that are always completely abiotic. Like there are both biological and abiotic ways to precipitate out um different compounds in the oceans and and bury them or or or or you know mineralize them. There are both biotic and abiotic ways to produce gases that have redox couples. But the only way that you cycle things down from sedimentary rock back into the planet is purely abiotic and that's just subduction or tectonics or something physical and there's no biological way to do that. It's utterly dependent on having those big geological processes in motion. Now is that necessary for life? I have no idea. Um or is it necessary for a biosphere? Uh but I think maybe it's important to make a distinction between processes that are um perhaps only accelerated by biology or facilitated by biology versus processes that are dependent upon um large scale abiotic systems being in place. Like biology can't invent plate tectonics if it's necessary for the continuation of the biosphere.",

So what happens if you have a deep ocean is you have 100 million years of exchange between the uh rock and the water uh while things are hot enough for melting to occur. But then you have solid state mantle convection with no melting and therefore no volcanism just because the weight of the water uh the pressure freezes the rock and so you don't get melting after that. Um but the planet despite the lack of geochemical cycles uh doesn't go unstable. It does warm over time because the sun is brightening and you get ex solution of carbon uh which is a positive feedback uh you get ex uh the warmer ocean can store less carbon. So this this is a positive feedback that warms the planet further but that positive feedback is not strong enough to produce a runaway and therefore the planet can stay habitable for billions of years.",

So if it's not the carbonic acid system that's doing it, um it it might be some other system. But then you start to get into questions of um of pH tolerance of of organisms. So um so so the simp the the the the answer to your question, I think is is no in the sense that, you know, you could imagine other buffering chemistries. But um to the extent that something in the realm of circumneutral, you know, like seven, I don't know, let's say eight plus or minus 1.5 pH units, um to the extent that that's important, then um that actually cuts down on the number of buffering systems that you can uh uh you know, plausibly invoke um just because of the PKs of of uh of the systems. And of course that'll change if if you if you fiddle around with pressure and temperature to some extent, but um so so the carbonic acid system is a um is a is a good one. And and also gives you a ready tie to uh regulation of of CO2 and climate over time in in ways that um uh I mean you you can conceivably do something similar with the sulfuric acid system and SO2. I I think you could probably imagine that, but the pH is in the in the fluids start to become uh uh pretty pretty low. So um so I'll I'm agnostic about how much of a problem that is, I guess, but um it's just something that biology will have to um hassle with.",
