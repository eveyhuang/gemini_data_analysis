But we don't seem to have done that at all for geochemistry. And that's partly because, you know, we have the one earth and we think we know what the values of these coefficients are for the one earth.

Um, so we we've been one thing that we've been very interested in in doing is um basically trying to model statistically what plausible um atmospheric oxygen abundances are. Um, so we have a a model that we sort of do sort of what you're describing to um uh and uh and just run the oxygen cycle to steady state and then try and generate statistical distributions of oxygen and and ozone abundances. Um, and you know, for for anything but the simplest models, um, it starts to become uh pretty pretty taxing uh just from a a a time scale perspective, you know, if you want to run an oxygen cycle to steady state and engage crustal reservoirs of organic carbon and reduced sulfur for instance, you know, you're talking about having to run models for uh, you know, billions of years uh for having some of our models don't come to steady state after the main sequence lifetime of a G star. Uh so, so if you want to run you know, many thousands of these or you know, even tens of thousands of these to to get uh a statistical sense, um, that can be um that's a model design problem.",

So if you start with lots of water and you lose water at a high rate, you end up with lots of water. And uh another example of that is nutrient recycling. So we think of the biological pump as uh you you you make a big pellet and then the pellet sinks. But if the uh sink rate is small, then you just end up with well mixed nutrients and if the sea floor uh volcanism is suppressed for whatever reason, for example, a deep ocean suppresses volcanism, then you don't really have a nutrient sink because you just create a weathering rind at the sea floor and then there's no further weathering.",

It kind of depends on the model, but um but yeah, I mean they'll, you know, they they will sort of include and this I think could probably be said sort of broadly for this this sort of style of model. Um, but uh they they'll include uh some representation of uh of the biosphere. Um, and you know, of sort of varying complexity and and mechanistic sophistication depending on the model. Um, sometimes they're very highly parameterized. Um, they very often don't handle, I would argue and I'll just say, you know, the models that that I use uh uh so I'm not sort of implicating anybody in particular. Um, don't handle nutrient limitation particularly well and in particularly like colimitation and limitation by trace elements, this kind of thing. Um, you know, partially because our our sense of how that sort of thing works when things are very non-modern earthy is um is is uh is a little fragmentary. Um, so, so yeah, I mean there's the uh, you know, there there are models that can be run, you know, you could shove off the biosphere and and run them uh as in sort of like dead dead planet mode and actually there's I think there's a I wish people would do more of that sort of thing. Um, but usually there's there's some at least sort of basic parameterization of uh of biological fluxes um uh um of, you know, varying uh sophistication.",

So I'm really interested in the volatile, the evolution of volatile reservoirs on moons and also on exoplanets, although I don't actually work on exoplanets and it sounds like we've actually done something a very simplified version of what you're doing but for solar system moons and so it is like the dead planet version. Um, but I was kind of had been thinking along the lines of um, yeah, that how the volatile reservoirs evolve and how the ratios of volatiles that are in the total inventory of the planet evolve over time due to outgassing, loss due to the stellar magnetic field in the case of an exoplanet, um, and then recycling back into the interior. So through this sort of outgassing and recycling, analogously to IO, which is something I spend a lot of time thinking about, you have this um, through recycling can get uh evolution of the total volatile inventory of the planet and as a result you can change the redox state of the mantle.",
