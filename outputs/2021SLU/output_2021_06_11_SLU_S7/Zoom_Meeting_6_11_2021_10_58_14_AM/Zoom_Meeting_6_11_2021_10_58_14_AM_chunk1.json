So the role of geological activity in the origin evolution of life, evolution of the oxidation state of a planetary mantle and surface environment, starting from Mahar and Chamberlain, how robust silicate weathering feedback to tectonic noise, soil dynamics, flood plains, carbon cycle feedbacks on earth and exoplanets. What are the different carbon cycle feedbacks in play during earth's states, I.E. greenhouse and ice house worlds and other extremes. Can we track these feedbacks through sedimentary signatures through earth's past and how might these inform exoplanet habitability? The effects of outgassing on planetary redox balances and can we constrain active volcanic outgassing or surface interior volatile exchange on rocky exoplanets.",
