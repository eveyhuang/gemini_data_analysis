Uh and so there's a sweet spot where uh you make the crustal nutrients uh available at some intermediate pace.",

And so what that would mean is you would have a lot of bedrock exposed uh on your planet and less efficient uh conversion of uh exumed rock into dissolved load.",

Like life arises, it uses some available substrate and it runs out of it and then that's the end. Um and that there's no way for a cycling to continue to replenish what it needs because there's no nothing a priori says that the organic molecules or the uh molecules dependent on the origin of life are going to be linked to biogeo geochemical cycles in such a way that they will be available in the future. That seems to be contingent at least, I would think so. So like can we think of situations where it would be obvious that this would be a dead end situation and it's only fortuitous that you happen to be get get connected to cycling of things that are needed for life's persistence or alternatively, you know, imagine that you produce life at some point produces um materials or compounds that are inimical to its continued existence.",

I mean the is working a lot on on other sort of trace uh nutrients that that can limit things and those are also potentially a hurdle but um that's what I imagine, you know, if you're if you're running down a biosphere that you've got you've sort of initiated and and now you know is is is sort of you know sputtering out, um I you know it's it's the most likely reason for that it seems to me is is that it will uh it just can't can't stay fed. And so one one question that um I I think is is important there is just what what are the what are the limits on, you know, sort of water inventories, tectonic regimes and uh you know, locations in the habitable zone say, you know, what combinations of those things actually allow for uh the recycling of nutrients on uh uh you know, 100 million year, billion year time scales.",
