We have a rover at Jezero crater, Jezero Delta, uh where we're going to see I going to predict we're going to see a lot of, you know, cross stratification from bed forms. So can we look at that and and and try to cross check any any geochemical measurements um and infer potentially make predictions for whether there was microbial life there.

Um so you know, stromatolites are potentially morphological fossils. But um by looking at at bed forms um basically the ambiguity looking at bed forms comes from the fact that other things could change bed forms to vary like flow conditions. But in the deposits you have other information about what the flow conditions were uh which would be less sensitive to the presence of life. Um like the presence of bars or grain size that that kind of stuff. And so you have a bunch of of pieces that you can put together to constrain the other parameters that could affect bed forms, you can make predictions of what they should look like if there was no life and then compare, you know, what they should look like with what they actually look like and potentially say something about whether um, you know, there was there was life.",
