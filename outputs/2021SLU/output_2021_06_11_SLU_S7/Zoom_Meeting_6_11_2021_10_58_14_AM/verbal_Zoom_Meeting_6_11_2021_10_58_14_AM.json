There are both biotic and abiotic ways to produce gases that have redox couples. But the only way that you cycle things down from sedimentary rock back into the planet is purely abiotic and that's just subduction or tectonics or something physical and there's no biological way to do that. It's utterly dependent on having those big geological processes in motion. Now is that necessary for life? I have no idea. Um or is it necessary for a biosphere? Uh but I think maybe it's important to make a distinction between processes that are um perhaps only accelerated by biology or facilitated by biology versus processes that are dependent upon um large scale abiotic systems being in place.

But um to the extent that something in the realm of circumneutral, you know, like seven, I don't know, let's say eight plus or minus 1.5 pH units, um to the extent that that's important, then um that actually cuts down on the number of buffering systems that you can uh uh you know, plausibly invoke um just because of the PKs of of uh of the systems.
