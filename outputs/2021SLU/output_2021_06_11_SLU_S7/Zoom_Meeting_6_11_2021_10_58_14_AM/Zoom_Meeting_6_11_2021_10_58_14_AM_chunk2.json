Can we in some way observe this, you know, or origin like observe this manifestation of origin of life and interpret them correctly. That's that's my questions as a observer.",

The reference that I'm most familiar with is actually an exotic bio signature for super Earth, which is ammonia. It's a paper by Sarah Seger in 2013. In their paper, they actually um predict that even the biomass is lower than that from the Earth ocean, uh ammonia, even the trace amount of ammonia, we're talking about sub PPM level can be detected by JWC. So this is just one example. So I think my point is that people have studied that. Um, of course, there are a lot of assumptions going into the calculation, but I think from the ballpark it's doable even with the, you know, slightly the, you know, next generation or even the current generation telescope, which is JWC. Hopefully it will be launched by the end of this year.",
