Um, for example, if we're turning it tectonic on and off, for example, turn carbon cycle on and off to see what are the resulting atmospheric chemistry would be especially like what it could be the possible water distribution, methane distribution and etc. and compare these different, you know, um samples to the observations. I think that could be a very interesting um comparison to make especially, I think for future uh missions. It we can we're very likely to measure the atmospheric abundance for exoplanet and I think that comparing observation to the model that you are developing is um it's going to be a very very exciting experiment.",
