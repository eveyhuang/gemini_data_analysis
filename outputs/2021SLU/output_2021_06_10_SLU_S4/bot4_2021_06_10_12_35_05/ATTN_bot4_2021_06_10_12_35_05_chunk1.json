As you can as you can see from the presentation, um, the reporting duty is is really relatively modest. It's just a few bullet points and and two or three minutes to talk about what this group did creatively. Is there anyone willing to do that?",

So I mean, Chris can be the main note taker, but if we see an additional comment or something we want to add that in as we go, that that should be that should be great. Maybe Nick since you also volunteered, you can you can help to add extra notes on those as it goes. Um, and then yeah, and then I guess we're all responsible as a group for picking which the three bullet points are um and then Chris will report out on those. Okay? And I know they suggested doing the one minute thing first, but maybe, you know, just not to dampen the energy, maybe we should just do the quick intros first and go to the one minute.
