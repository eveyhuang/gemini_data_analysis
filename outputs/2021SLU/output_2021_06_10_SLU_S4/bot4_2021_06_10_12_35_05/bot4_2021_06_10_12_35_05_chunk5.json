So you could imagine creating a database of of these low key planets, you can imagine creating a database of planets that have biology on them from barely getting along to more vibrant even than Earth and throw that at the community and say, can you tell us what's going on in these planets? And I think initially the answer is probably no, they can't sort these things out. Um but it it would be um it would be a clever thing to do well in advance of building your Luvar or your Habex.",

      "transcript": "So this is going a kind of different direction because I work on more on moons than on planets, but I was thinking of of this in the context of the the icy satellites and if you have um let's say a habitable environment or even life in an ocean underneath an ice shell then the bio signatures or even habitability signatures um depend heavily on understanding the ice shell and what's going on in the ice shell, what the gradient of materials or chemicals is within the ice shell, what the gradient of temperatures is. And so this goes two directions, it's the downward direction and the upward direction. In the downward direction people use, you know, the chemicals that are on the surface of the ice um and say, oh if if those chemicals can get into the ocean then the ocean is habitable. Um but to make that inference you need constraints on whether those materials can diffuse or otherwise get through the ice shell. Conversely, if you want to try to detect bio signatures, you have to think about what the bio signatures are in the ocean and what products of those bio signatures could get to the surface and how you would distinguish them from exogenic material. And so there's this whole exchange problem that needs to be understood, what thermal gradient is required in the ice shell for example and what conditions like tidal heating or endogenic heat flow, what are the conditions that enable that thermal gradient. Um and these questions have definitely been explored for certain mission targets and especially in the context of mission studies, um but from my understanding, I think like a more broad and a little bit uh study with also with less of a specific agenda um is warranted for understanding how we would detect both habitability and um bio signatures.",

And like is it is it conceivable if you look at evolved stars that you could be seeing a planet that is now a water world that used to be an icy world or something?

Um it'd be an interesting control case because we know what species we know we have some sampling of what species are in the ocean based on what's coming out in the plumes and what's in the E ring. Um and so we can look at what's on the surface which is basically nothing but and and infer what is diffusing through the ice shell and use that as kind of a study to to make sure that your models for which chemicals can diffuse through the ice shell actually makes the right predictions for Enceladus where we have some constraints on the ocean chemistry.",
