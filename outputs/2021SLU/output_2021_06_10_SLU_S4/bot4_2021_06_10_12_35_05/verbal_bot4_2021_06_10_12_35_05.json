So it actually just occurred to me, we kind of assume that methane either comes from archea, like life, archea mostly, um, or that it comes from, you know, like serpentinization reactions, which my understanding actually is that's not, well, we can debate about that about the source of that. So previously it's been assumed that that actually abiotic flux of methane is pretty low across the board and through history too as Tim was saying. I was just thinking actually, knowing what we know now, um, about the delivery of organics early on, we know actually thermogenic methane is very abundant, right, in oil reservoirs. But we think that that mostly comes from algae and phytoplankton, right? Um, this is the whole oil industry. Um, I'm actually wondering could thermogenic methane come come from the caragen delivered early on from meteorites? Um, that's my that's my thought as of as a false positive on other exoplanets if we see a bunch of methane, right?

And in the solar system we have too small a sample size to do argument for analogy for what uh, abiotic rocky planets do. Every time you go to a new world like IO or Venus, we're confronted with a new mode of tectonics. So if we can't use argument for analogy, what other first principles we come out? Well, stoichiometry, sure. Uh, we thermodynamics, uh, and energetic limits. But those are those constraints are much looser uh, than uh, we normally think and one reason is that we can't make the steady state assumption. Uh, impulsive events like super plume head arrival or even just an intermittent uh, limit cycle in the tectonic mode, um, or of course uh, impacts like was being discussed in Timothy uh, Lence's uh, keynote uh, can um, you know, give you transient high fluxes even late in a planet's life.

And so this goes two directions, it's the downward direction and the upward direction. In the downward direction people use, you know, the chemicals that are on the surface of the ice um and say, oh if if those chemicals can get into the ocean then the ocean is habitable. Um but to make that inference you need constraints on whether those materials can diffuse or otherwise get through the ice shell. Conversely, if you want to try to detect bio signatures, you have to think about what the bio signatures are in the ocean and what products of those bio signatures could get to the surface and how you would distinguish them from exogenic material. And so there's this whole exchange problem that needs to be understood, what thermal gradient is required in the ice shell for example and what conditions like tidal heating or endogenic heat flow, what are the conditions that enable that thermal gradient. Um and these questions have definitely been explored for certain mission targets and especially in the context of mission studies, um but from my understanding, I think like a more broad and a little bit uh study with also with less of a specific agenda um is warranted for understanding how we would detect both habitability and um bio signatures.
