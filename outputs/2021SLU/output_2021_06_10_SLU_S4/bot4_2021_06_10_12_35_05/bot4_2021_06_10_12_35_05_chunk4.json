Um, you know, we may be able to understand significant amount of the context that relates to atmospheric chemistry, but to the chemistry that relates to the solid planet uh and the impact that that has for example on abiotic fluxes and and as Eddie said what's reasonable to expect from abiotic processes. Um how much constraint can we levy on that context based on things that we can observe and and given the uncertainty that results um how does that propagate into uncertainty into what the abiotic fluxes are uh you know, both both productive and and destructive fluxes. So I'd be interested to hear what all of you think along those lines.",

You you might have a place that challenges the origin of life but then would be gangbusters if things actually get going or vice versa and so um I'd be interested to hear what folks think about how to address that sort of joint issue.",
