Um so that was just the second second bullet point. Um one of the points that that seemed important um was uh this this distinction um that I think Stephanie and and Tori made uh in particular between the favorability for the emergence of life and versus the favorability for uh the sort of development and maintenance of robust bio signatures and that these these may not necessarily always be uh the same. Um and something we should be thinking about. Um so that was another one and then I I just added that this this this notion of um this kind of catalog of bad actors um or these these trickster planets or whatever um or Loki planets that are like to call them um seemed like uh something that that people were were kind of interested in as well. Um and uh uh seemed like something worth highlighting.",

Is that is that the idea?",
