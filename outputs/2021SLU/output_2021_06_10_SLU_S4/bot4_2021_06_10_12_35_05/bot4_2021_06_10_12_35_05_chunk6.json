And if there if there's other planets that are rocky farther out, then that might give you some inkling as to what those planets are like. Um with the caveat that it's possible that the lava planet is just the leftover innards of like a Neptune or sub Neptune or something. But like, who knows, maybe the inside of a sub Neptune is just a big rocky planet too.",

Because we really we need really late types for for JWS T to work um with the transmission. Um, but it's an interesting problem uh because at least for the ground based, we tend to prefer things that are nearby. Um, and you're sort of looking towards more earlier type M dwarfs for that. So we may not, we may be lucky, we may find something in the M4 to M6 range that can be done with both techniques, but that's going to be tough.",
