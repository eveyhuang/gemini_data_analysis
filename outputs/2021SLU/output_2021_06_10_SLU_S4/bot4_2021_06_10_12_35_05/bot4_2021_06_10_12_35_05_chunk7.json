And I would love to see a diagram and I think it would be useful for the entire community, uh, that has fluxes of some of these key bio biological molecules, bio molecules, say methane with lines on it or indicators on it for um like what you could expect from some of these crazy systems that we've dreamt up here, systems that we know about on earth, biological systems, people have probably put this diagram together because it sounds useful and they've probably done it for earth systems, but you could start to populate it with um uh dreamt up uh but relevant examples from uh kind of the exoplanet realm.",

So you take Vicky's example ofzation um to and sticking with hydrogen production because that's I understand that better than methane production. Um you would start by saying well how much lava can a planet make? What are the energies going to that radiogenic plus accretion heat uh and put that all into lava, which is a lot more than the 10% that it does on earth. And then assume that's profusively cracked and you make hydrogen byzation from that what's that up in that.",

It's between it's between 10 and 100 million years. Um and then it's gone.

You know, what are the discriminants of this false positive scenario? Can we think of other things that are going on in the atmosphere and the environment. Um yeah, and you'll give Ty's fluxes and we'll we'll model things and try and figure out, you know, given the limits that we have on retrieval, um, you know, how well can we discriminate these planets.
