And in the solar system we have too small a sample size to do argument for analogy for what uh, abiotic rocky planets do. Every time you go to a new world like IO or Venus, we're confronted with a new mode of tectonics. So if we can't use argument for analogy, what other first principles we come out? Well, stoichiometry, sure. Uh, we thermodynamics, uh, and energetic limits. But those are those constraints are much looser uh, than uh, we normally think and one reason is that we can't make the steady state assumption. Uh, impulsive events like super plume head arrival or even just an intermittent uh, limit cycle in the tectonic mode, um, or of course uh, impacts like was being discussed in Timothy uh, Lence's uh, keynote uh, can um, you know, give you transient high fluxes even late in a planet's life.",
