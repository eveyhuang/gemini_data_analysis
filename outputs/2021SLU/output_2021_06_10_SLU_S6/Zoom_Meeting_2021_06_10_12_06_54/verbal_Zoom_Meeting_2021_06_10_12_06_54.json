And then also potentially looking at not just finding biosignatures on a single planet, but using ensembles of planets um to perhaps allow us to get at the probability of life um in a given population of planets. Then finally, I think our most important um frontier is really developing all of the bits and pieces that we are going to need for a probabilistic framework for biosignature assessment. Um and what I mean by that and and this is sort of some components of it but there are certainly many others that we can discuss at the workshop over the next couple of days. But we need to, you know, fundamentally assess the significance of the detection. ",
