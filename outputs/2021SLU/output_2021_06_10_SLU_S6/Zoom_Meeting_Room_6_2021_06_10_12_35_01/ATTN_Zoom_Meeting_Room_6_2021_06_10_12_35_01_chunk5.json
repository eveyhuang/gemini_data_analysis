Is it metals or or other uh microbial organisms and um I'm not sure you ever really win in terms of um uh biogenic production of oxygen in unless you slow down the uh rate of supply of of uh eruptive products and metals to the surface. So super earths again might just have enough residual heat and ongoing volcanism for so much longer that it just, you know, basically prohibits the oxygen revolution that we saw on earth relatively early on. Um, so I I I think that um knowing something about the size of the the the body and and potentially it's um state in terms of convection and and supply of metals would be a key factor to see whether or not um you you're uh just basically consuming all the oxygen with oxidation of of those materials or or or if it's um the supply of material to oxidize is low enough that that the biological processes that signature begins to dominate.",
