Um, but yeah, to answer the one thing that's and this was uh falling back on that comment about energy being probably like the one commonality for living worlds. I I I would probably take that a step further and say that it's information because uh a living world is going to have more states and have greater unexpectedness and contain more information than an abiotic world. How you identify how much information is contained on a planet, totally separate issue, but in terms of a commonality that I would regardless of class of planet, whether it's ocean world or an environment with a subaerial, um I think that it um biotic worlds will have a a greater information than abiotic world.",

Um, yeah, we can so great question. Please follow up with me afterwards and I can I can rant on about the definition of information. Uh, but it is actually intrinsically tied with entropy, which is intrinsically tied with energy and and so I think those are actually dealing with a similar overall metric. Uh, for for Joe's comment about ocean worlds, they're really tricky because again, you have fewer states. So continents and subaerial weathering uh in the context of what we're talking to about CO2 drawdown and the Wilson cycle and being able to look at reaction, that there's really critical. If you have a purely ocean world drowned by continents that or oceans that are 10, 20 kilometers uh thick or even deeper, um you just don't have those other environments.",
