Um but we could maybe what I'm thinking, okay, so the time thing is difficult because we live so short compared to a planet's lifetime. But I guess maybe one thing the exoplanets give us, we have thousands of them. And so maybe we can pick um we can have enough of them that we can pick planetary systems that look identical to us, but the difference is just a stellar age and so we could maybe see if we can sort of stitch together evolution in time by not looking at one planet, but by looking at 10 planets that look from what as far as we can tell identical other than the stellar age and therefore the planetary age is sort of a rough proxy as a first step to getting a handle I guess on evolution.",

I I don't because I didn't want to dominate the but I like I think trying to do sort of a a time sequence, I think maybe using exoplanets, I think maybe you know, it's not unique, but I think it's an important step to actually test sort of the history of earth and life emerging on it and how it changes sort of earth and sort of testing that in a in a way because I don't think we have any other way to test whether this is something that life in general will do or that's just like so unique to earth that um, you know, it will be different for each planet. So although I can see many flaws by having to use 10 or 100 exoplanet systems to stitch this history together, I do think it's sort of a unique window in emergence and evolution of life that we um probably don't get any other way unless we can manage to live for a very long time in which case it's not a problem.

And we've talked about this a little bit in the context of detectability. But I think this was sort of the issue at at heart talking about our different groups of worlds, right? That you you could have a thriving ocean world and you would never detect it. Sorry the uh lights went off. In the same way that a thriving terrestrial world with surface photosynthesis uh would be easily detectable. Um so I guess that yeah, but so that tell us something fundamental about the biology producing capability of these different groups of worlds. Um and does that lead to a prioritization of what we should look for or uh I'm not trying to exclude ocean worlds at all. I'm just I'm wondering if there are different in the same way there are different classes of worlds, there may be different classes of biospheres and that may change the the strategy for thinking about commonalities between them.",
