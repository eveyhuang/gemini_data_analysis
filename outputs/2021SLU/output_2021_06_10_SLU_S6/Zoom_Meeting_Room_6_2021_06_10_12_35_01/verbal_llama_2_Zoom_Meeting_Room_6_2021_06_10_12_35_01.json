Um but there's meandering rivers in environments that don't have vegetation that you know, ice can do this and under the ocean, you know, clays can do this. So how do how do we how do we push that that sort of that you know, some of those puristics about the role of life or like, you know, this question of of how life uh accelerates or decelerates erosion and and kind of needle on where those uncertainties are, where it can do both is can or uh or can be abiotic. how do we isolate those?

I during uh Zoom meetings, I I often use the chat quite a bit because I don't like to interrupt and I think it's actually a good way for other people to be able to have a little bit of a sidebar but there's also a record of of the chat. So, um if I do put things in there, I am listening. I I just uh find that's also a useful uh notepad. Um in terms of so so the earlier discussion is is great. I I think that's really helpful. Um I just maybe take a a step back to to look at the framing of the the question. So so the idea was that uh what are the commonalities um of worlds that um are basically alive or have a ecosystems. And um I guess the two uh key things that come to mind uh would be uh when and where uh because those commonalities are going to be radically different depending on when in the history you're you're you're considering on that body. And the the other key issue is where by which I mean um that the planetary system itself. So, um this sort of if we take a step back and think about would we expect commonalities between living worlds? And the answer may be yes, but I I think that it's quite likely that you would have classes of living world. And so the commonalities aren't going to be the same over all worlds. If you have a world that is uh drowned in deeper oceans, so a super Earth that ends up putting more water onto the surface and you simply don't have continents, then um it doesn't mean that that it will undergo the same types of uh development and share commonality with a world that does have continents. And so um on some basic level we could think about um initial conditions plus life leading to either states of divergence or convergence and are there particular classes that might exist at a particular time that would be indicative of of life. But I wouldn't expect a super Earth uh especially one which was an ocean world to have the same types of bio signatures, the same commonalities uh that that that we see on on worlds with continents or other radically different living worlds. So, um just to think about the question, would we actually expect there to be commonality uh between living worlds or are there classes of living world that um through the biological calculation process where life is trying to create a stable environment that you lock into one of these classes um and we should be comparing between those classes rather than across all worlds.

So you could imagine uh an early completely anaerobic biosphere um that is producing methane that accumulates and is detectable as an anomaly, there shouldn't be that much methane. Um, and maybe you can make an argument for that being a bio signature. But once oxygenic photosynthesis evolves, that methane might be getting scrubbed, might be getting oxidized in the water column or locally. Um, and those might be an equilibrium where you see neither methane nor oxygen in the atmosphere. I think Kim kind of pointed at that one of his slides, but in terms of a big picture concept, maybe there is a detectability window early, but then the redox balances wipe it out later if you do evolve oxygenic photosynthesis. Um, how much you would get? I don't know. Like today methanogenesis is thriving off of a highly productive ecosystem that's running on oxygenic photosynthesis. That's why there's so much organic material to be reduced to methane. So we can't even use the current methanogenic pathways as a proxy for what be going on in the early Archean in terms of how much to expect.
