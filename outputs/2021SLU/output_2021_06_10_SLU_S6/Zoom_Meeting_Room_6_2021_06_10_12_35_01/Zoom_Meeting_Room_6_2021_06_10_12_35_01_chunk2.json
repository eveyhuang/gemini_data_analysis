Uh Earth of course, we talk about having a red edge because of, you know, photosynthesis and the fact that we have, you know, so many photosynthetic organisms that it's something that is detectable on a global scale. And so depending on what body an exoplanet or sorry, what star an exoplanet is orbiting, uh and what wavelengths we might anticipate would be usable for photosynthesis or something related to light absorption, that's something that we could look for.",

Um you know the the life that arises on a planet is shaped by the initial conditions on that planet, uh but in turn the life will will also influence that planet. And so um you know, a living planet will likely deviate from planetary properties uh from one that does not have life. And so the things everyone look for um are, you know, these these different properties from an abiotic planet, right? And so we've heard about uh atmospheres in in the keynote, but um this is also true of surfaces and uh potentially even planetary interiors. Um especially if there's plate tectonics. Um so in terms of the the large scale features, I guess it depends on how large uh um we mean, but um in terms of surfaces, this is uh what I know the most about. Uh you know, it's been proposed that life could have an effect on topography. Um we also know that life affects uh sedimentary environments. For example, the uh types of rivers that can form and um and and their uh their morphology and the way they operate.",

It was uh and Teller on uh where they uh uh put the idea out there that there could be a topographic signature of life. Um it's a really cool paper in which all the different ways that life can affect landscapes. Um so things that, you know, you want to look for is um for example, if you look at a hill slope, you know, how does life affect um sediment transport on the hill slope and what kind of effect does it have on uh the topographic profile, the convexity of the hill slope. Um so you know, things like tree throw on the earth for example, little earthworms, uh gophers, life has a significant uh impact on on sediment transport, which itself is reflected on uh the morphology, things like hill slope asymmetry for example as well. Um or again, uh if you have vegetation in flood plains that will um affect the way uh that rivers work. Um now we don't necessarily expect to see vegetation on other planets, but things like microbes also stabilize sediments and can have a significant impact on uh the morphology of bed forms and and uh and other uh features and land forms in sedimentary environments.",

I'm thinking about there's one with this with this question in mind, my brain immediately went to ideas of how life could affect erosion and sediment to supply um which there's been like one or two papers on how this then can affect um changes in subduction speeds and styles and crust growth, you know, coupling all this back into the interior evolution. Um but then as I was saying about that, I couldn't remember what, you know, this paper I was thinking it was arguing that life enhances erosion and sediment supply to subduction zones and I I actually couldn't really put my finger on why that would necessarily be the case or if that would always be the case.",

            "transcript": "Um it's a it's a very good question and it's I don't think it's one that has a an easy answer, right? Because life can do both. It can enhance erosion and it can uh uh also slow it down. It depends what part of landscape you're at and what kind of biological process you're looking into. Uh if you're on a hill slope and you have trees that tend to fall, you know, they'll promote slowly erosion. Um but if you colonize a flood plane with um you know, shrubs, you're going to stabilize the banks and prevent erosion. Um microbes tend to stabilize things as well, but they can also promote uh and accelerate um silicate weathering, right? So there is kind of this dual um effect that life can have on on erosion, yeah.",

Because you know, it it's striking if you look at Earth's sedimentary record that, you know, trees arise in therian and all of a sudden meandering rivers are everywhere. Um but there's meandering rivers in environments that don't have vegetation that you know, ice can do this and under the ocean, you know, clays can do this. So how do how do we how do we push that that sort of that you know, some of those puristics about the role of life or like, you know, this question of of how life uh accelerates or decelerates erosion and and kind of needle on where those uncertainties are, where it can do both is can or uh or can be abiotic. how do we isolate those?",

I think we need to move beyond just the um kind of uh binary check of, you know, do we see a meandering river or do we not see a meandering river? Uh because as you said, we know that they can form in different types of of, you know, biotic or abiotic environments. Um",

Um so something that I actually I would be very interested um in seeing coming out of this, uh an idea that I I I'd like to pursue is to look into um how microbes for example can affect the stability and the size of bed forms in fluvial environments.",

Certainly it's not going to be a binary yes or no uh answer. It's most likely life or habitability and then life associated with it exists on some kind of a spectrum. And so I I agree with him that being able to bring sort of math and Bayesian analyses and other types of statistical uh techniques to be able to understand one world in the context of others um could be actually really powerful. So comparative planetology as we're starting to expand our understanding of things in our own cosmic backyard as well as other exoplanets, if we can find groupings of worlds that, you know, exist in similar conditions and one is, you know, a statistical anomaly and stands out in some way, uh that could be something that we could leverage and exploit.
