So if there's there's subsequent impacts after you've lost your your envelope then certainly that could help create topography.",

Um but the fact that that initial condition was this hot planet that was losing gas, does that initial condition screw up the planet in the long run?

Uh you may end up getting um uh more extreme uh early volcanism at least um and presumably that'll die down uh over time because you'll get your radiogenic budget will will die off. Um if you have high tidal heating, there's no reason to expect that to die out with time and you might expect you have more extreme volcanism throughout the course of your planet's lifetime. So maybe there's sort of two scenarios here where you have one kind of planet that will have early early high volcanic fluxes that make the surface uninhabitable but it gradually dies off and at some point you have enough stable, you know, nice surface environments that you can have life start. whereas in a tidally extremely tidally heated uh scenario, maybe it's just always too much volcanism.",
