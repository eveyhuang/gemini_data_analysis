And so um it's not necessarily that they could survive for long term. I'm specifically thinking about multicellular life. They can't survive long term within, you know, an oxygen poor environment, but they can they can they're adapted enough to kind of flip between the these extreme environments and maybe more habitable environments and these gradients though, are usually the locations that have the best energy availability or other important, you know, things that you need. So to me there was that question of are we talking about adaptation to the extreme environment itself or some sort of environmental gradient? And that sort of got me thinking about what Laura was saying in terms of how spatially far away some of these um just like stepping into volcanic zones and IO, you know, the distance at which you might find these extreme environments could be really important role in terms of creating these gradients that can be.

And you look at the the geological record of extinction, you know, the number of species on this planet has increased throughout geological time and it's usually after mass extinction events that you tend to get major new biological innovations and big increases in the standing diversity for example generic or species diversity in the oceans. And so one advantage of having very short strong abiotic gradients especially is that they may change and move and drive things extinct and thus create new ecological opportunity. Like you need that selective pressure in order to drive natural selection. And so I think I finally managed to get my head around this that you know, a planet where there's lots going on and there there are more extremes, you are going to tend to generate more complex, more interesting ecosystems.
