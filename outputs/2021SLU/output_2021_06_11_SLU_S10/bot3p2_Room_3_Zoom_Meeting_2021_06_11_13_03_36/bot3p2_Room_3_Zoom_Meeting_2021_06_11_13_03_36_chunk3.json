At least that's my understanding or pigments ideally, but you know, so they're just spewing out gases like on earth with oxygen today.

Like in the in the killing curve. Um, and that would be a sign that there's some sort of biosphere that's like pulling in CO2 and then kind of like decomposing at other times of year. So that might be like a really good bio signature, though I suppose there's probably some abiotic ways, like we know there are abiotic ways of of messing around with CO2, though I'm not sure that that any of them operate on like a seasonal time scale, but that could just be my own ignorance.",
