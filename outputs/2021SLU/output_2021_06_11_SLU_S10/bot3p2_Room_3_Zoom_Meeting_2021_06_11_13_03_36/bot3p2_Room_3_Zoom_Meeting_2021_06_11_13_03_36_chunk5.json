And I think it's similar to what maybe Nicole was saying recently about like temporal gradients too of you know, fluxes and all um the time scale which things change because that's also depending on, you know, how quickly a bio molecule will degrade, you know, before it can potentially turn into something else.

Like often in ecology, like when we look at modern ecosystems, you need to perturb them in order to keep them healthy in order to keep sort of things diverse. And you look at the the geological record of extinction, you know, the number of species on this planet has increased throughout geological time and it's usually after mass extinction events that you tend to get major new biological innovations and big increases in the standing diversity for example generic or species diversity in the oceans. And so one advantage of having very short strong abiotic gradients especially is that they may change and move and drive things extinct and thus create new ecological opportunity. Like you need that selective pressure in order to drive natural selection. And so I think I finally managed to get my head around this that you know, a planet where there's lots going on and there there are more extremes, you are going to tend to generate more complex, more interesting ecosystems. Because otherwise even in extreme gradient if it's if it's if it's static then you you know, there's not much sort of there's not much for natural selection to operate on, right?",

So they have no seasons and they have no diurnal cycle. So everything we see there will be in a steady state. Um so there are temperature gradients and you know, the ocean and the winds are going to be blowing about and trying to flatten those gradients. But like nothing ever changes. Like the the sun doesn't move in the sky, right? So like maybe those planets are just inherently flawed as like a good place maybe not for life to originate like you said, but but uh for for life to stay healthy however you put it, you know, of kind of like repeatedly poking it and stressing it to try and have it um evolve well.",
