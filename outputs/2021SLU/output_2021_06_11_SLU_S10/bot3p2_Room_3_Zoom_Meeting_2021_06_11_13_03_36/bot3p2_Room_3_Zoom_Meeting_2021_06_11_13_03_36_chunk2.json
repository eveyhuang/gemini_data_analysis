So you have, you know, if you have lavas floating your surface constantly, do you have any sort of stable sheltered environment in which life can form? Um if you have a lot of constant volcanism, you have lots of outgassing, that might have severe climatic impacts. Um and yeah, so so so those are definitely some of the um the influences. Um if you have an ocean, how does extreme heating of the bottom of your ocean change the circulation? Does that impact your climate? Does that impact your habitability? Um so those are some of the things that that we've been thinking about with my with my student. Um and I don't want to give answers because we don't have any yet, but I'm also here curious about other people's thoughts. But there is often um if you look at title habitability papers, people just kind of put in a sort of arbitrary cutoff if if planet has more tidal heating than IO, it's obviously it's not habitable, but is that really uh is that real?",

A lot of volcanism on IO is is restricted to lava lakes uh actually, which are, you know, pumping out a lot of heat. Um so the the internal heat mechanism uh heat uh transport mechanism on IO is heat pipe um transported. there's no stagnant lid or or plate tectonics kind of tectonic settling. Um so you've got these very localized centers but the rest of this the surface seems stable.",

Um so something that's really on my mind at the moment is looking at the world's, you know, the earliest eucarits to emerge on this planet. Even, you know, when we first see them in the fossil record, they have very sophisticated adaptations to living in a life in moving fluids. So the fluid environment is is one that is obviously you know, very selective, right? And there's a number the limited number of ecological tricks you can play in order to be successful in a fluid environment. And so thinking about exoplanets and particularly water worlds, I'm interested in thinking about are there predictable ways in which organisms might evolve on water worlds? Is there something about the chemistry or the viscosity of the water that we could you know, explore and think about, you know, what does what does what does a light what does an organism that is adapted to, you know, a really viscous or non-viscous or even sort of, you know, liquid hydrocarbon fluid look like? What are the tricks you might be able to play?",

            "transcript": "I can I can kind of follow up and actually uh touch on what something Laura was saying. So sorry to just keep on switching back and forth. But the things I was thinking about similar to Simon was maybe like in form the ocean perspective, you know, there are a lot of organisms today that can have adapted to live like at the edges of extreme environments like oxygen zones. And so um it's not necessarily that they could survive for long term. I'm specifically thinking about multicellular life. They can't survive long term within, you know, an oxygen poor environment, but they can they can they're adapted enough to kind of flip between the these extreme environments and maybe more habitable environments and these gradients though, are usually the locations that have the best energy availability or other important, you know, things that you need. So to me there was that question of are we talking about adaptation to the extreme environment itself or some sort of environmental gradient? And that sort of got me thinking about what Laura was saying in terms of how spatially far away some of these um just like stepping into volcanic zones and IO, you know, the distance at which you might find these extreme environments could be really important role in terms of creating these gradients that can be.",

And that dead category I think is a really interesting one too that could be really useful here and like what is dead? There are still genes there and obviously there's all sorts of things waking up from the permafrost that might have seemed dead. Um and you know, if organisms don't have to die and don't lose their tissues, I think that is an interesting thing to potentially look for just these like quiescent hanging out not growing, not living, not actually consuming much energy but somehow being maintained um theoretically that could happen over really long time scales, right?",
