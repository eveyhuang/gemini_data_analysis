That's going to be really hard for life to use in a useful way because you're not like prepared to cope with it. On the other hand, you have like a diurnal cycle or a seasonal cycle, you get practice on it every single time and then you have some flexibility with your temperature and UV and you're prepared maybe for one of these more large challenges. And it seems like I mean like someone has thought about this who isn't me. But like fundamental evolutionary time scale of like how fast can you actually how many times do you need how many times your immune system have to see this before you actually develop some flexibility in your ability to respond to it and can you get little doses of temperature change that then prepare your biosphere to handle these larger more catastrophic events.",

One of is one of which is like the evolutionary potential of an organism and there's evolutionary potential of a biosphere or an ecosystem. And you know, those would be different time skills I think and maybe we're moving beyond what we're talking about here, but um I I don't know I think about the molecular side and I think that question about what is what is dead is really interesting because that's a to me that's a way I hadn't thought about in terms of what does it mean for a single cell organism to be dead versus what an ecosystem to be dead. They're they're parallel but maybe a little bit different.",

So I guess depending on what kind of critters we're looking for on an exoplanet our our um preferred planet might differ.",

And so I guess you have to like life has to sort of start at the right time so the gradients are potentially somewhat smaller at least in terms of coming back to Morgan's point of just like maybe you can't survive and you probably can't survive a large temperature fluctuation until you figure your lipid though um or your enzyme or whatever and so you need this sort of like small change time and then and then as you get you know more complex then you're more resilient or this sort of memory idea of um uh how to um survive those larger fluctuations.",
