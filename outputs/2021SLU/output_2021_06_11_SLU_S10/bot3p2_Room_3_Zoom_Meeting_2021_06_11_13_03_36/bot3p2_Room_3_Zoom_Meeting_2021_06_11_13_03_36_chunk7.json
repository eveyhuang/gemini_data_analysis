But then eventually once life gets a foothold, then you want gradients and and changes in gradients and and and you basically want to stress the life to try and like force it to like loom and diversify.

They might actually have more volatiles if I understood correctly because they've lost, you know, they started with a whole bunch of volatiles and then they just lost the hydrogen and the helium and so they might end up with like more carbon and nitrogen and oxygen than we would expect on a terrestrial planet.
