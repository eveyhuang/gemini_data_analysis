Um, easy, we can probably cover that ground in just a few minutes and then I'll have a coffee break or something. So, um, so, uh, so, so I think we're all getting to know each other at this point, but, um, but we'll go around the room shortly just to make sure. Uh, before that, could I ask if there's anyone who is willing to, uh, serve as our reporter? Or else risk random assignment to that topic? Morgan, I, I see you talking, but you have, you're muted. You'll do it. Okay, awesome. Thank you. I appreciate it. Um, okay, so, uh, so maybe let's just take a quick minute to go around the room and you know the drill. Um, try to keep it really quick. Uh, a little bit about you and yourself and just looking at the order in which people appear on my screen. Um, Eliza, can you go first? ",
