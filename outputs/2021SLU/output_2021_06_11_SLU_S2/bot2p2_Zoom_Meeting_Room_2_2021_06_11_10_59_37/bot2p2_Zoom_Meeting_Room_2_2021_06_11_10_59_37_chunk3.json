I, you know, I'm I'm thinking of in like in like biological proteomic experiments, there's a technique called Silac where like stable isotopes like labeling and cell culture or whatever. And so what they'll do is when they're growing cells, they'll have some of them where they feed them isotopically heavy amino acids in their diet, right? And so they can actually like they can like kind of split different cell populations and then do like relative abundances and comparisons. And so I'm almost yeah, like I I can almost imagine something similar but like on just on like a chemical level where you you dope in like different you know, organics that are isotopically enriched and then do like model prebiotic reactions or things like that and actually see kind of where they end up. Um, and also you can almost like seed it into, you know, if you have like different like populations of microbes or things like that and I don't know. Is is that kind of what you're talking about Amanda?",

But in your case you're talking about the the history of which is this is good. Yeah, I mean I don't know, it sounds like this is something that someone could have done before, but maybe not. Maybe it's something that's that's that's something that is possible. But yeah, the the history of the aquis alteration and map it out according to uh the the isotopic enrichment. That sounds like something that's quite feasible. It looks like you froze, I don't know or maybe I froze.",

            "transcript": "I have a quick comment on this too. I think one of I really love thinking about this from a meteorite perspective because that's a very different piece than I've usually thought about with amino acids. But certainly when we're talking about something that we think of as so ubiquitous like amino acids in the biosphere, like the biosphere is almost a little too clever sometimes and the the amount of recycling and reutilization and direct uptake as opposed to direct biosynthesis is huge of course on the modern biosphere and maybe if these really are ubiquitous, something we would expect to see all over the place is really creative utilization and reutilization of amino acids. I mean one of the things um someone joining my group soon looks at two sulfur bearing amino acids because I'm a sulfur fan, you know, and using one of those might be directly biosynthesized depending on your organism. One of them might be taken up from food and actually the offset in sulfur isotopes between those two can tell you something. But depending on who you are, your pathway to getting at methine can be very different. Um, and so I think this is a really exciting idea but one of the challenges is going to be to strip back all the processing that happens in these higher trophic levels and try to get at maybe we just need to talk about Alanine or something, you know, maybe there's a simplified version of the system, a little less fun obviously. Um, but those complexities are likely to exist anywhere.",

            "transcript": "So I'm going to suggest that um this is a really obvious bullet point for for our report out and probably an obvious thing to crystallize a mini breakout discussion around because it sounds like there's some real traction in the topic. Um, just to pick up a thread that that you just mentioned Morgan, you know, maybe something like the extensive recycling of of resources is actually a characteristic of a biological system that doesn't exist in in abiotic systems, right? To to sort of think about that in in a little bit of a negative context. And it brings me back to a word that Amanda used earlier which is pattern. So in all kinds of different areas that people think about signatures of life, I think things are trending in the direction of you know, what what are the patterns that are really characteristic. And um, so I wanted to maybe try to pivot a little bit and and think in for example an exoplanet frame of reference or something along those lines. Um, uh, you know, what what are the patterns can what are the equivalents that we can think about in planetary atmospheres for example. And I wonder if this will take us a little bit in the direction that Liz mentioned of of thinking about systems in terms of their, you know, their entropy or their energy or you know, or patterns in those things. So, um, for folks in that realm, um, where do your thoughts lie on this?",

Um, you know, on a global scale, you detect you detect a gas, you detect a couple of gases um on an individual planet that that that still is probably not the smoking gun. I mean similar to to what you're all talking about with um with uh abiotic isotope uh isotopic fractionation that that that could be biological but but could also uh be abiotic. It's the same problem on on any individual planet. Um, so um, uh, yeah, I'm thinking about about trends over many objects, um, what would be what what what would be the smoking gun of of life if you could if you could see a particular trend in many planets. I'd love to get feedback from from all of you because that's kind of again, my knowledge of biology is is uh is very limited.",

So if one of the exoplanet, you know, I guess one question is at least in my mind sort of the most the zero order question and I guess that takes us a little bit back maybe to energy and entropy and information, you know, is there something really quantitative we can say or will we be stuck forever being like, well, if you have non-equilibrium chemistry and loads of oxygen and some methane, then maybe this is our best guess. So I you know, can we take this further? Um, I think even knowing, you know, whether we can do this, I think would be very valuable in my from my point of view.",
