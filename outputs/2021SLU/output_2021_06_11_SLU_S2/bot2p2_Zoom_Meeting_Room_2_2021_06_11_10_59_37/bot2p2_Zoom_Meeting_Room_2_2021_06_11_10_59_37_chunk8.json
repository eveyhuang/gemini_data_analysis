Um you know, like looking at like multiple isotopes um you know, thinking about um the amount of processing that's involved to generate the isotopes that we see, and kind of this statistical distribution of them. Um let's see, we talked about amino acids, we talked about kind of like biological recycling of really common small organics and different pathways. Um let's see, we talked about um can we do phylogeny on amino acid fractions? We talked a lot about that. Um let's see. Um kind of thinking of, you know, exoplanets as we as we get more and more of them as this kind of larger statistical distribution and you know, like what what information can we get of like when we can actually sample, you know, um I think as Eliza said, you know, tens, hundreds, thousands of these, like what what can we get kind of a big picture data um that we can't get just from looking at one or two. Um let's see. Um organic processing and um you know, like differences in stability as potential bio signatures and things like persistence of molecules that we would expect to break down um perhaps or um like, you know, continual production of them. Um any other any other big takeaways that that people had?",
