Um, and it might well have been written up by one of you and some of the language that I really liked about it, um, was first of all the notion that we want to try to quantify some some aspects that are different between living and non-living systems and um rather than thinking of it in qualitative terms, I I think that the notion of being able to quantify is an important one and maybe some ground that we might try to look to. The other one was was, you know, it wasn't the distinction wasn't just made between living and non-living systems, but rather between prebiotic systems, um, living systems and dead systems. And so thinking of all of those as representing something like a continuum maybe in in the way that systems structure themselves in in chemical and other terms, I thought was interesting and so, so to extend the discussion in those directions also, um, might be kind of useful. But um, but I wanted to ask, does does anyone want to kind of dig into this discussion and and I'll ask that um, because I can't see quite everyone on my screen, um, please just jump in whenever you feel it's appropriate. Don't no need to raise hands or anything like that. Um I hope it'll just be a free flowing discussion.",
