Um I'll tell you about a project that I I just got funded um that obviously is is NSF fundable so therefore not crazy enough but could be a feeder. So it's um doing carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen isotopes of amino acids derived from uh protein from subsurface ecosystems essentially to track different parts of trophic relationships between microbes within deep subsurface environments. And the reason to do that is because the input carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen comes from different places and as many of you know, of course, when these amino acids are being synthesized, it's going through different biochemical pathways. And so nitrogen isotopes are canonically used to track fractionation, uh trophic ladders, uh hydrogen isotopes reflect something about water, but also something about central metabolism, um whereas carbon isotopes are fairly complex in amino acid uh space. And so it's possible to measure all three. Um there's also people doing and not me, but people with bigger mass specs um who are doing um position specific isotopes. So like what does this particular carbon look like on this amino acid? Um that work is still very hard. So you have to be like, I'm going to focus just on glycine and glycine from this pool and um selecting that out. But part of me like listening to to Jay talk um about, you know, uh proteinzation and sort of doing some of these things abiotically, I would be really interested to think about sort of the the discrimination of an abiotic system compared to the discrimination of a biological system while polymerizing amino acids because that's what both of those systems do. So you can think about simple microbial systems compared to fully abiotic systems and somewhere in between. ",

I think one of I really love thinking about this from a meteorite perspective because that's a very different piece than I've usually thought about with amino acids. But certainly when we're talking about something that we think of as so ubiquitous like amino acids in the biosphere, like the biosphere is almost a little too clever sometimes and the the amount of recycling and reutilization and direct uptake as opposed to direct biosynthesis is huge of course on the modern biosphere and maybe if these really are ubiquitous, something we would expect to see all over the place is really creative utilization and reutilization of amino acids. I mean one of the things um someone joining my group soon looks at two sulfur bearing amino acids because I'm a sulfur fan, you know, and using one of those might be directly biosynthesized depending on your organism. One of them might be taken up from food and actually the offset in sulfur isotopes between those two can tell you something. But depending on who you are, your pathway to getting at methine can be very different. Um, and so I think this is a really exciting idea but one of the challenges is going to be to strip back all the processing that happens in these higher trophic levels and try to get at maybe we just need to talk about Alanine or something, you know, maybe there's a simplified version of the system, a little less fun obviously.

So in all kinds of different areas that people think about signatures of life, I think things are trending in the direction of you know, what what are the patterns that are really characteristic.

Because you're right, you really can't tell if it's, you know, biotic or abiotic. But there are other small organic molecules like how oxygen is, it's a it's a reactive gas. Well, there are small reactive organic compounds in the absence of of life would just degrade very quickly. And if you see them in an environment and I'm thinking, I mean something I'm near and dear, oxilo acetic acid, the heart of citric acid cycle compounds, these these molecules are ridiculously reactive. And yet if you see them in in a different environment outside of biology, that would be very exciting both for an organic chemist and it's more indication of how the heck is this molecule persisting is that life? So that in that case it's it's something where the identification of of one single molecule and organic compound could in fact bring more interest to that environment. So so there are some that are in fact very intriguing and perhaps if an astronomer said, listen, I see this this this gaseous just a keto acid or something in in the atmosphere, wow, that would excite us. Anyway, so just to help you out, I'm also interested in that as well and um, you know, looking at discrete organics but ones that may be a little bit more um uh, you know, telling of of a biotic system.

And it goes back to this discussion of pathways that that Andrew and a few other people have brought up earlier on is that one of the characteristics I think of life is that um, it down selects from a very large set of possibilities and settles on pathways that give you specific things, right? And and so that's the the you know, the principle that underlies some of the patterns that we look for in for example organic molecules and that kind of thing. I wonder if that principle is transposable into the question of of exoplanet atmospheres, right? If if there's a large number of states of possibility for abiotic worlds and that that inhabited worlds settle on a small subset of those and strongly represent them. And so, um, I think that would be a really cool already I can see several places where there's strong potential for crossation between the way that these different communities approach this problem.

Um let's see.
