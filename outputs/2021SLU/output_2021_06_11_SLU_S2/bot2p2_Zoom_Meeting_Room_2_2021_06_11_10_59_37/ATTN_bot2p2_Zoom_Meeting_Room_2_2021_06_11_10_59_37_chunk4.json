Um, the question though, I mean I don't think anyone's done this yet really is um, is is to look at the magnitude of expected signatures. Um, I mean so we can, you know, Natasha as well like you know, we can simulate if there was an input, we could simulate it and see uh what the what the expected observable signature is, what the magnitude is and and exactly how far off from I mean it's not uh not going to be detectable today, but how far off are we from it is is there a measurement that one could make with a 30 meter class telescope or is this going to require uh you know, 100 meter telescope, something something, you know, far off in the future. It would be interesting to look into. We just basically need the predictions on our end.",

Um, and so you don't always get accurate abundances of those isotopes, but you just detect their presence and that might be kind of when this if this first is, you know, demonstrated feasible, it's probably going to more look like we've we've detected with some significance that these things might be in the atmosphere, but we don't actually know what their precise abundances are. Maybe relative abundances would be easier.",

I mean the chemistry that formed the hazes, um, that's that's certainly that's certainly interesting.
