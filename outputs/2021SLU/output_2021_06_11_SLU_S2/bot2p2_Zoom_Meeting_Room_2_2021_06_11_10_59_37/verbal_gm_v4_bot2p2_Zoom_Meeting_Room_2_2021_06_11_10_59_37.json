The other one was was, you know, it wasn't the distinction wasn't just made between living and non-living systems, but rather between prebiotic systems, um, living systems and dead systems.

So it's um doing carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen isotopes of amino acids derived from uh protein from subsurface ecosystems essentially to track different parts of trophic relationships between microbes within deep subsurface environments. And the reason to do that is because the input carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen comes from different places and as many of you know, of course, when these amino acids are being synthesized, it's going through different biochemical pathways. And so nitrogen isotopes are canonically used to track fractionation, uh trophic ladders, uh hydrogen isotopes reflect something about water, but also something about central metabolism, um whereas carbon isotopes are fairly complex in amino acid uh space. And so it's possible to measure all three. Um there's also people doing and not me, but people with bigger mass specs um who are doing um position specific isotopes. So like what does this particular carbon look like on this amino acid? Um that work is still very hard. So you have to be like, I'm going to focus just on glycine and glycine from this pool and um selecting that out. But part of me like listening to to Jay talk um about, you know, uh proteinzation and sort of doing some of these things abiotically, I would be really interested to think about sort of the the discrimination of an abiotic system compared to the discrimination of a biological system while polymerizing amino acids because that's what both of those systems do.

I mean one of the things um someone joining my group soon looks at two sulfur bearing amino acids because I'm a sulfur fan, you know, and using one of those might be directly biosynthesized depending on your organism. One of them might be taken up from food and actually the offset in sulfur isotopes between those two can tell you something. But depending on who you are, your pathway to getting at methine can be very different. Um, and so I think this is a really exciting idea but one of the challenges is going to be to strip back all the processing that happens in these higher trophic levels and try to get at maybe we just need to talk about Alanine or something, you know, maybe there's a simplified version of the system, a little less fun obviously.

Well, there are small reactive organic compounds in the absence of of life would just degrade very quickly. And if you see them in an environment and I'm thinking, I mean something I'm near and dear, oxilo acetic acid, the heart of citric acid cycle compounds, these these molecules are ridiculously reactive. And yet if you see them in in a different environment outside of biology, that would be very exciting both for an organic chemist and it's more indication of how the heck is this molecule persisting is that life? So that in that case it's it's something where the identification of of one single molecule and organic compound could in fact bring more interest to that environment. So so there are some that are in fact very intriguing and perhaps if an astronomer said, listen, I see this this this gaseous just a keto acid or something in in the atmosphere, wow, that would excite us. Anyway, so just to help you out, I'm also interested in that as well and um, you know, looking at discrete organics but ones that may be a little bit more um uh, you know, telling of of a biotic system.
