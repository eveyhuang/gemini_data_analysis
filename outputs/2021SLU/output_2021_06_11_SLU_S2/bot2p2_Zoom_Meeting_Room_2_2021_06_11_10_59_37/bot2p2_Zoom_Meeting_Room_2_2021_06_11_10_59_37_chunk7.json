Um, but it was what Natasha was saying that you're still the the signal like you don't you don't get this like exquisite beautiful spectrum where you can just see all the lines, you get something that's like stuck in the noise underneath the fact that what you're primarily seeing is the star. Um, and so you make a template spectrum that has, you know, that that has like the various isotopologues that you think might be present and you cross correlate against the noise and by leveraging the the the power of the entire broad spectrum, you get out a signal, you get out, you know, there's there's there's a match and there's a better match with one with one template than another. So it it is it is possible. I'm I'm on a paper right now that has that that potentially has a um a isotope measurement in a but in like a hot Jupiter atmosphere, um, and it's easy it's it's like it's CO, it's like the easiest molecule to go after. Um, so it's it's the the concept is being proven.",

Um, yeah, I I so I mean the technique they were using to kind of study molecular complexity was mass spectrometry. They so they would like isolate molecules and break them into pieces and look like how many pieces do we generate and kind of correlate that to this idea of molecular complexity and and I actually I think it's a really intriguing idea.",

And it goes back to this discussion of pathways that that Andrew and a few other people have brought up earlier on is that one of the characteristics I think of life is that um, it down selects from a very large set of possibilities and settles on pathways that give you specific things, right? And and so that's the the you know, the principle that underlies some of the patterns that we look for in for example organic molecules and that kind of thing. I wonder if that principle is transposable into the question of of exoplanet atmospheres, right? If if there's a large number of states of possibility for abiotic worlds and that that inhabited worlds settle on a small subset of those and strongly represent them. And so, um, I think that would be a really cool already I can see several places where there's strong potential for crossation between the way that these different communities approach this problem.",
