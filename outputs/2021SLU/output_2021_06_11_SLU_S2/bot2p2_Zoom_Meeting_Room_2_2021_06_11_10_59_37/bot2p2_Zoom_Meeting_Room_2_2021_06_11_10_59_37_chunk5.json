Think adopting some of the statistical perspective that has necessarily emerged in in the exoplanet field. Um, and I wonder if there are places that you can see that kind of perspective brought to bear in an in situ context, right? The cross pollination I think would be a really nice outcome of of what we can do in this in this discussion.",

But to follow on, I think one intriguing thing to me seems to be that, you know, what would be a bio signature uh on earth has changed significantly over time and, you know, when we look at exoplanets, of course, we only get one snapshot in time, but maybe by putting that together as a large sample for different stellar ages, we can try to, you know, check or probe this evolution of life that we had on earth and the bio signatures that come with it, you know, and do a test statistical test sample case for exoplanets. So I I'm wondering if that may be another way we can connect um or another way to distinguish and connect and test this ideas of, you know, emergence of life and the bio signatures that it leaves and that we could look for.",

Um, and they put together um, they they basically synthesize the outcomes of both of their theories, um, and uh and put together a statistical framework for it to to basically figure out how many planets and what sample you would have to observe to distinguish between these these two input theories. I I thought that that was that that would be that framework would be just great to bring to this problem. Like I'm just two basic theories. I don't know. It could be it could be life emerges always and life emerges very rarely or or life alters atmospheres early, life alters atmospheres late. Um, and you have your two input theories and then you figure out what the observable is and how many you have to observe and what types of systems you have to observe.",

I am going to do a little bit of a devil's advocate here where um there are many planets with which to um develop a theory for planet formation. We have one emergence of life. So how do we develop a theory that is actually testable with only one data point with which to base that theory.",

            "transcript": "So my I I'm just making like a crazy suggestion but how about we say planets that are similar to earth had in very early emergence of life and it left signatures very similar to what we would have expected for earth. I don't know a methane rich atmosphere at the beginning and then, you know, it changes to an oxygen rich atmosphere of I don't know after two giga years. Just this is a default and then we can compare that with observations and see whether that's true or not true. It's, you know, it's it's not great, but I think it's like a zero order thing we could maybe try to quantify.",

And so, um, you of course couldn't think of, you know, developing exact models is probably not within a possibility. But thinking like zeroth order, you know, think of like a very simple gas like methane, you know, or or even a sulfur gas like, you know, and the question is if you observe 10 systems, is it there, is it not and what quantities or how does that relate to another molecule. Um, you know, if if you were trying to develop some like these two models that Eliza was talking about, what would what would that look like just at a super simplistic sense.",

Because the observables are are so different. And in the case of what you can observe in exoplanet science, I think, you know, the information content is really in the system, not in the individual molecules necessarily that you're looking at and and so, you know, that's that's where you begin to see the patterns or, you know, or in observing multiples of those systems and in situ, we look at things often in a very different way where the information can be in an individual observation.",
