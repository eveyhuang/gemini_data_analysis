Um yeah, you know, I it's something that I've been thinking a lot about and was something that people were talking about kind of earlier in the talk was understanding like molecular networking like Andro brought that up too and um understanding a lot of these like pathways and processes that connect a lot of these small organics together. And um I think that's I think that's super interesting but I think it's really hard. And um you know, I'm just that like for example, when people are looking at a lot of um small metabolites in biological systems, right? It it one of the hardest parts of those studies is like they get all they get tons of this data and they can do all this networking and um really cool analyses but it's actually figuring out exactly what the molecules are, right? You know, a lot of times they have to purchase the standards and run the standards and compare them to the, you know, and and that that's really the most time consuming part a lot of times of those analyses.",

I mean and and and you know, like when we think about going from, oh, I want to look at this molecule and this molecule and this molecule to all these molecules and how they interact with one another, um you know, like scaling that or like or or doing that kind of work on a on a rover or something is is a real challenge.",

And so um I don't really know where I'm going with this to be honest with you.",

   "transcript": "No no worries, Jay, I actually have a follow up with that um to to expand with that to everybody else as well is that you know, Tori asked about well what's the importance of amino acids? Because you're right, you really can't tell if it's, you know, biotic or abiotic. But there are other small organic molecules like how oxygen is, it's a it's a reactive gas. Well, there are small reactive organic compounds in the absence of of life would just degrade very quickly. And if you see them in an environment and I'm thinking, I mean something I'm near and dear, oxilo acetic acid, the heart of citric acid cycle compounds, these these molecules are ridiculously reactive. And yet if you see them in in a different environment outside of biology, that would be very exciting both for an organic chemist and it's more indication of how the heck is this molecule persisting is that life? So that in that case it's it's something where the identification of of one single molecule and organic compound could in fact bring more interest to that environment. So so there are some that are in fact very intriguing and perhaps if an astronomer said, listen, I see this this this gaseous just a keto acid or something in in the atmosphere, wow, that would excite us. Anyway, so just to help you out, I'm also interested in that as well and um, you know, looking at discrete organics but ones that may be a little bit more um uh, you know, telling of of a biotic system. This shouldn't be there. So that's all.",
