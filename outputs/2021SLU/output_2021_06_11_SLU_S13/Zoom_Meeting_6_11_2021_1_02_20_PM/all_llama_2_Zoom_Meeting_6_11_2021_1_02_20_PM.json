I I I tend to use quite a bit to be able to um uh put my thoughts and to be able to have a sidebar discussion and copy and paste into the document afterwards. Um, but in terms of extreme environments, um although rates are very important, I I was just wondering what people thought of of of time itself. So especially if you have periods of um cyclicity or punctuated habitability, does um time or the interval between those uh environments constitute an environment itself. So is is there a temporal environment that we should be considering rather than just assuming that everything is uh occurring uh in more continuous fashion.",

That you you often hear the retort that well extreme to us is is not extreme to others, right? Our conditions are extreme to some organisms and it it suggests that across the board the notion of extreme is entirely relative. And I wonder if we can poke at that assumption a little bit because you know, I I of course it matters if if the conditions that that allow the origin of life are more restrictive, right? Then there is a center point and and life can radiate out from that. So maybe it's worth asking um are all conditions equivalently permissive to that origin so that the center point can move equivalently anywhere in in parameter space. Um and is there such a thing as as an absolute extreme instead of a relative extreme as as Solange just described, you know, one person's great is another person's terrible.

He had a paper last year. I just pasted in the chat. I'll put it on the slack so we have it for later where um he found a fungus that would grow in just ridiculously high perchlorate. It was like two and a half molar, which, you know, is is not quite one of these, you know, transient brines or things like that. But I think that just shows that at uh some of this stuff we can push it further than we think and we're kind of talking about two different ideas here whether it's you know, the the surface of IO sure maybe not, but at um yeah the, you know, these hypersaline environments. Um, you know, I I I think that um the sort of to the question of um, you know, the the sort of dark matter of these experiments where we're looking at hypersaline environments and the ones that look like they didn't work. The analytical biochemistry is just tough with these and I think that um that there's, you know, there may just be not be stuff there may be stuff that we're just not seeing.",

Um and I think that's a good place to discuss but but um, you know, there there are other other permutations and in the context of the IO example, I suggested um IO is actually a very uh likely world for um habitation for more advanced organisms that are looking for abundant energy that might not have some of the other precursors, but if it's an exogenic organism that's bringing what it needs and um but is in search of energy then um the habitability of IO might just be a a question of of of time. Um, I don't really want to go down the route of of the advanced astrobiology is just a a comment to provoke a little bit of thought. Um, but but I think that at least everything I'm hearing at the moment is assuming that we're talking about endogenically derived uh microbial organisms, the simplest possible uh for forms of life or or or their uh very basic uh descendants.

So so if you know, life like property. So I could imagine for example, if you think of the covalent chemistry, at some point thermal motion will overcome covalent bond stability. And that will happen at different levels for different kinds of bonds representing different functionality. So things would sort of sequentially fall off the table as possibilities that are open to life as you move along a temperature scale and and maybe more subtly things that we think you need for life like really high fidelity molecular recognition, you know, so not covalent bonds but non covalent chemistry, things like that. Um, can you imagine putting yourself anywhere on the temperature scale and still getting that that kind of possibility represented. So I'm just wondering if if, you know, if by sliding a temperature slider, you can say here are the things that are possible and here are the things that are not in relatively absolute terms.",

This is something we've thought a lot about with um the work with perchlorate and Mars because one thing that um, you know, the the reason perchlorate is so interesting to me not just because of Mars is because it's on the far end of this ranking of ions called the Hofmeister series where it's on this end of what are called catropes. Um, and what catropes tend to do is, you know, they unfold biopolymers and part of that is bringing organics into solution and and you know, thinking about organics, you know, it's usually like a hydrophobic core of a protein. Um, so that can have pretty profound effects on, you know, solubility of organics and things like that as well as, you know, obviously that's going to influence folding behavior of biopolymers. So it's not quite speaking to the same thing that Amanda and I have been talking about in terms of like bond energies and things like that, but I think that also ties into, you know, really important things about life and biochemical systems or even alternative biochemical systems because um, you know, folding in water is so driven by the fact that water wants to interact with water and that's kind of the origin of the hydrophobic effect that uh, you know, the both salt and being sub or supercritical water can change these in pretty profound ways. So I I completely agree that I think uh salinity could also have profound impacts and that's also going to depend strongly on the identity of the ion because sulfate is going to behave very differently than something like perchlorate.",
