These formations of the stripped away uh cores of Neptune, could could anything survive that transition or or is the only possibility that life is developing after that that that initial uh formation and then sort of catastrophic event. So uh we've had some discussion about late heavy bombardment and these other sort of catastrophic uh events and and one of the suggestions was if life got a foothold, maybe even the late heavy bombardment isn't enough. if something developed on an early uh sub Neptune or Neptune object, can can it survive a an event of that magnitude or or is that just game game over for everything that's there?",

Like there's ongoing debate kind of how much water we'd expect within these planets. There are some groups that say all the planets formed near on the orbits near where we see them today in which case they'd mostly be comprised of rocky material and hydrogen helium. You could still Edwin Kite and Laura Shafer have an interesting paper where they say you could still produce water as the from the reactions of the hydrogen with the magma. Um, but then other groups say, oh, you we'd probably form a bunch of have a bunch of material migrating from beyond the snow line in which case these would have a lot of water in their interiors. And yeah, there's some like one example is K218B is a planet where it has an appropriate kind of distance from its star and and radius and mass such that it depending there's a range of uncertainties, but it could potentially go through um pressure temperature space where you could have kind of liquid water um on its surface before you get to a rocky core.",
