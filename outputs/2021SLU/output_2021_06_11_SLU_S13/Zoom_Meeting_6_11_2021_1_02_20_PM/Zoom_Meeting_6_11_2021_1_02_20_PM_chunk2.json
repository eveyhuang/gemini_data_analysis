Um, another large part of my group is looking at what is the um spatial distribution of um bio signatures in recently resurfaced areas where um bio load is low and there's not much input from um anthropogenic or macrofauna um contamination such as uh the um volcanoes in Iceland. So uh I feel like Chris and I probably have some things to talk about there. Um, but we're also interested in those uh spatial distributions and um heterogeneity in uh sampling in order to help inform how to best sample such that you are accurately measuring what you're attempting to measure whenever you cross gradients uh in volcanic regimes, hydrothermal regimes, um recently we've started working more in hypersaline regimes as well.",

Um and how might these play out in different systems. So there's the example of brines, salinity but there are obviously many other parameters to play with. Does that seem like a place to start?",
