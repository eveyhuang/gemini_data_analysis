So so if you know, life like property. So I could imagine for example, if you think of the covalent chemistry, at some point thermal motion will overcome covalent bond stability. And that will happen at different levels for different kinds of bonds representing different functionality. So things would sort of sequentially fall off the table as possibilities that are open to life as you move along a temperature scale and and maybe more subtly things that we think you need for life like really high fidelity molecular recognition, you know, so not covalent bonds but non covalent chemistry, things like that. Um, can you imagine putting yourself anywhere on the temperature scale and still getting that that kind of possibility represented. So I'm just wondering if if, you know, if by sliding a temperature slider, you can say here are the things that are possible and here are the things that are not in relatively absolute terms.",

Um, so I really like this idea of sliding that temperature extreme up to the point where chemical um recognition now becomes more covalent than Vander walls interactions. Um, you you could envision a world like that where like double bonds are the main background uh backbone that is holding things together. Um, but uh recognition comes through covalent bonds type of a thing. That's a total pipe dream. I don't know that that could ever possibly exist. But could you calculate from thermodynamics the limit at which you could no longer get a carbon carbon double bond, a carbon carbon single bond, a carbon carbon triple bond? Yes, that that is calculable.",

            "transcript": "It's a good question and I I think it might. Uh, and um, and I think it would depend a lot on the identity of the ion. This is something we've thought a lot about with um the work with perchlorate and Mars because one thing that um, you know, the the reason perchlorate is so interesting to me not just because of Mars is because it's on the far end of this ranking of ions called the Hofmeister series where it's on this end of what are called catropes. Um, and what catropes tend to do is, you know, they unfold biopolymers and part of that is bringing organics into solution and and you know, thinking about organics, you know, it's usually like a hydrophobic core of a protein. Um, so that can have pretty profound effects on, you know, solubility of organics and things like that as well as, you know, obviously that's going to influence folding behavior of biopolymers. So it's not quite speaking to the same thing that Amanda and I have been talking about in terms of like bond energies and things like that, but I think that also ties into, you know, really important things about life and biochemical systems or even alternative biochemical systems because um, you know, folding in water is so driven by the fact that water wants to interact with water and that's kind of the origin of the hydrophobic effect that uh, you know, the both salt and being sub or supercritical water can change these in pretty profound ways. So I I completely agree that I think uh salinity could also have profound impacts and that's also going to depend strongly on the identity of the ion because sulfate is going to behave very differently than something like perchlorate.",

So in terms of reaction feasibility and reaction possibilities, um, which is a lot of what we've been talking about here over the range of temperature, etc. But what about if you broaden it to the full scope of what it is to be life? Um, so I see one being relevant to origins of life and building more complex molecules and the range of possible reactions that are polymerizing and otherwise. But what about the the synergistic scope of process and reaction that is life and how the limits play out similarly or differently as you imagine it holistically, comprehensively.",
