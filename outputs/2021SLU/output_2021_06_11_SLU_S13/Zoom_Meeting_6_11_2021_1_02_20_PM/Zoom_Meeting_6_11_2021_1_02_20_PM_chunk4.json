Can can you express the scientific rationale for that in terms of fundamental principles about biology, right? I think that we would all agree, but we might give different answers as to why we think that's true. And then if you if you work backwards from that boundary and say how far how far back toward the middle can you come um and still agree that that, you know, everyone thinks that's uninhabitable for the following reasons and and at some point I I think we all would fall off that curve at different points for different reasons.",

One was that at um I'm sure you've heard Dirk's name come up when we when people are talking about IO and whether it could support life because I think he's uh really pushed it in terms of what sort of uh extreme environments. He had a paper last year. I just pasted in the chat. I'll put it on the slack so we have it for later where um he found a fungus that would grow in just ridiculously high perchlorate. It was like two and a half molar, which, you know, is is not quite one of these, you know, transient brines or things like that. But I think that just shows that at uh some of this stuff we can push it further than we think and we're kind of talking about two different ideas here whether it's you know, the the surface of IO sure maybe not, but at um yeah the, you know, these hypersaline environments. Um, you know, I I I think that um the sort of to the question of um, you know, the the sort of dark matter of these experiments where we're looking at hypersaline environments and the ones that look like they didn't work. The analytical biochemistry is just tough with these and I think that um that there's, you know, there may just be not be stuff there may be stuff that we're just not seeing.",

Um and I think that's a good place to discuss but but um, you know, there there are other other permutations and in the context of the IO example, I suggested um IO is actually a very uh likely world for um habitation for more advanced organisms that are looking for abundant energy that might not have some of the other precursors, but if it's an exogenic organism that's bringing what it needs and um but is in search of energy then um the habitability of IO might just be a a question of of of time. Um, I don't really want to go down the route of of the advanced astrobiology is just a a comment to provoke a little bit of thought. Um, but but I think that at least everything I'm hearing at the moment is assuming that we're talking about endogenically derived uh microbial organisms, the simplest possible uh for forms of life or or or their uh very basic uh descendants. Um and I think that's that's fair. It's just something to think about. We're we're looking at a very narrow spectrum of complexity.",
