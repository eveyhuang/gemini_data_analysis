And that will happen at different levels for different kinds of bonds representing different functionality. So things would sort of sequentially fall off the table as possibilities that are open to life as you move along a temperature scale and and maybe more subtly things that we think you need for life like really high fidelity molecular recognition, you know, so not covalent bonds but non covalent chemistry, things like that. Um, can you imagine putting yourself anywhere on the temperature scale and still getting that that kind of possibility represented.

This is something we've thought a lot about with um the work with perchlorate and Mars because one thing that um, you know, the the reason perchlorate is so interesting to me not just because of Mars is because it's on the far end of this ranking of ions called the Hofmeister series where it's on this end of what are called catropes. Um, and what catropes tend to do is, you know, they unfold biopolymers and part of that is bringing organics into solution and and you know, thinking about organics, you know, it's usually like a hydrophobic core of a protein. Um, so that can have pretty profound effects on, you know, solubility of organics and things like that as well as, you know, obviously that's going to influence folding behavior of biopolymers. So it's not quite speaking to the same thing that Amanda and I have been talking about in terms of like bond energies and things like that, but I think that also ties into, you know, really important things about life and biochemical systems or even alternative biochemical systems because um, you know, folding in water is so driven by the fact that water wants to interact with water and that's kind of the origin of the hydrophobic effect that uh, you know, the both salt and being sub or supercritical water can change these in pretty profound ways. So I I completely agree that I think uh salinity could also have profound impacts and that's also going to depend strongly on the identity of the ion because sulfate is going to behave very differently than something like perchlorate.
