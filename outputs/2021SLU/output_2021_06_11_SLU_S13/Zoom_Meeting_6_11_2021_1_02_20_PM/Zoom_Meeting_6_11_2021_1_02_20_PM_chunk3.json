Um, I put in the the chat which um just FYI for the people too. I I I tend to use quite a bit to be able to um uh put my thoughts and to be able to have a sidebar discussion and copy and paste into the document afterwards. Um, but in terms of extreme environments, um although rates are very important, I I was just wondering what people thought of of of time itself. So especially if you have periods of um cyclicity or punctuated habitability, does um time or the interval between those uh environments constitute an environment itself. So is is there a temporal environment that we should be considering rather than just assuming that everything is uh occurring uh in more continuous fashion.",

That you you often hear the retort that well extreme to us is is not extreme to others, right? Our conditions are extreme to some organisms and it it suggests that across the board the notion of extreme is entirely relative. And I wonder if we can poke at that assumption a little bit because you know, I I of course it matters if if the conditions that that allow the origin of life are more restrictive, right? Then there is a center point and and life can radiate out from that. So maybe it's worth asking um are all conditions equivalently permissive to that origin so that the center point can move equivalently anywhere in in parameter space. Um and is there such a thing as as an absolute extreme instead of a relative extreme as as Solange just described, you know, one person's great is another person's terrible. Is there something that's terrible for everyone?",
