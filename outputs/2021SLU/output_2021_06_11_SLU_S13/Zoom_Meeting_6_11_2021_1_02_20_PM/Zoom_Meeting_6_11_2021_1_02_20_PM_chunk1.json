Uh my lab works on uh prebiotic chemistry uh at the point where you kind of start to get assemblies. So moving past uh sort of simple small molecules but before early cells. So things like uh you know the RNA world, how primitive cells formed from simple precursors like fatty acids. Um, with regard to the prompt and why I put this as one of the ones that I was particularly interested in the last three years or so, uh we started doing a lot of work on uh RNA world type scenarios in hypersaline environments and in particular Mars.",
