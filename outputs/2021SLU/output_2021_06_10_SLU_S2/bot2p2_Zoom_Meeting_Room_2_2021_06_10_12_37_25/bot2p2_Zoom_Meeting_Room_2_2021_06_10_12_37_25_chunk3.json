            "transcript": "So I I had a bullet that was just kind of a general thought about the state of this field, which is that in so as you know if like in origin of life, there's all these funding sources, but they are really specifically about early earth and it's always about trying to get, you know, at what it was the origin of life on earth. This is true for like the NASA RCNs, exobiology and everything else. And then we have all these planetary science questions about other worlds and life on other worlds, but there is no funding that I've ever found where you could study the possible origin of life on another world in a non-earthlike manner. And so that's that's been a real problem for someone who's interested in life detection like me because, you know, I want to say, well, on Mars for example, could you have life begin in some other way than earth, but you can't really do those experiments. And I think that's a real like issue in in linking these two things. So that's kind of a general thought. And then as far as uh go ahead.",

So it um I I think it may move in that direction even if we aren't there yet.",

And there's things the things I think about are there's all the wild theories of could you have totally alternative life chemistries and maybe. But I also wonder, you know, there could just be main similarities between life here and life on exoplanets, but the but the origin of life was actually different than it was on earth and maybe the initial steps of chemical evolution were different. So it could be carbon based, it could be in water, but it's still not the same as earth. And so there's a lot of experiments that could be done, even big things early on like minerals direct reactions, but how exactly and which minerals are prevalent. And you know, you could imagine like I think on early earth, the redox state of the planet was a huge factor because you have let's say iron two very rich in the oceans and an atmosphere of mostly CO2. And what is the redox state of the atmosphere? What is the redox state of the mantle? Like these are huge drivers for what sort of reactions you might have even with all the same chemicals that we are used to. And so that's the sort of stuff that I think would deserve more experimental investigation that kind of hasn't been done.",

But you know, we think of prebiotic chemistry as something that happened in the, you know, long ago past and obviously it did once and n equals one of celestial bodies, but there's no reason this couldn't be happening other places right now, I think and I think that that's something that is kind of speaking to what Laurie said a little bit underexplored.",

I think a big question is if we can see any of those excuse me, the evidence maybe for uh, you know, possible microorganisms that uh, you know, living, you know, in you know, beneath the the ice core that um move, right? So yeah. So like I I think the reason paper, you know, like uh the big publications, they suggest, you know, there could be some serpization process, they have enough methane and some, you know, small organic molecules, organic nitrogen compounds that maybe that the micros will be favorable, you know, using them, right? For their metabolism. Um, but I think the big question is how do we know? Like, you know, if we send like uh uh orbiter, right? To the Sadus to collect this uh samples, how can we tell if they're coming from, you know, maybe abiotic synthesis or maybe some microbial processes, right? That uh um moon, right? So yeah.",

There's also a lot of so the stability part is really interesting to me, how long can we maintain these before, you know, things will happen or reactions will happen.",
