In recent years, I'm focused on the radiation budget of a planet and moons. Uh, the reason is because I think the radiation budget and the top of the atmosphere can help us better determine the surface temperature of a planet and moons. So it will help to look for the life because the temperature is so important. So the radiation budget on the top of atmosphere can help us better determine the temperature. The other thing is the light curve because if you want to study the radiation budget, you have to study the light curves of a planet. Light curves can tell us what's the composition in the atmosphere of a planet, what's the aerosol size, is there any bio signature, something like that. I think light curves are also important for the study. that's it.",
