Um, and uh, and they give quite different results, you know, depending on uh, you know, which parameters we choose. Um, and uh, I I think for for the experiments, uh, you know, if like radiation is a big concern for the planet uh, the planets to form, the stars to form, uh, we can maybe uh, put more emphasis, right? On studying maybe different wavelengths of the UV and you know, radiation time, uh, and for, you know, the the daily cycles, maybe seasonal cycles, um, they always, you know, they also tools we can simulate those processes, you know, we can also study like a cooling and warming processes, uh, you know, with the, you know, different temperature gradients to simulate this process as well. Um, but we don't know, you know, the results for those uh, you know, how how that, you know, related to the real situation, the real world out there. So, um, but you know, definitely worth exploring, you know, there are lots of opportunities there. Yeah.",
