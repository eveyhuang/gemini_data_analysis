Um, there can be solutes that obviously absorb some UV themselves and they can be kind of sacrificial and that can provide kind of a uh screening effect.",

Of course, the UV, the shorter wavelength radiation is very important because it provides the energy, basically, the strong energy for the chemistry in atmosphere. So actually I want to uh explore the problem from maybe from a different perspective. I think the country, the temperature determination of the exoplanets, basically based on the spectral, the infrared spectral or maybe maybe the distance from the mother star, something like that to estimate the temperature. I think maybe there are some other way to better, you know, determine the temperature. I mean the surface temperature, not the temperature on the top.",

So if the planet doesn't have atmosphere, that means the temperature will change a lot from daytime to night time. It's not good for life because for example, for for for Mars. Mars the atmosphere is very thin. The temperature, the daytime temperature and night time temperature, the difference can reach a couple of hundred degrees. So for for for but for if the planet have have atmosphere, so you can check the temperature on the top of atmosphere, but the top atmosphere temperature is totally different from the temperature on surface.",

But if you check uh Venus, if you check Titan, the temperature difference is huge. So that's mean even you're current I mean actually I'm not the expert of exoplanet. I I'm not sure which method they are using to determine the temperature of exoplanets. But by my point even for the planets in our solar system, even for the planets and moons in our solar system, we don't have determine very well the surface temperature. You know, because so uh of course we have some in situ measurements for the mass surface temperature, but if you check the global, I mean global scale temperature, that's other problem. So that's mean what's the radiation budget on the top, what's the radiation transfer inside of atmosphere, then what's the precisely what's the temperature on the surface. I I mean and global scale. That's actually even for Mars, we don't have very good very good knowledge for that. Of course the for the same thing for the Venus, for the Titan, you know for maybe for yeah. So I mean if we if we can figure out one one way to better determine the surface temperature of exoplanets. That I mean it will help help us to find life help us to find liquid water and life and so on. So that's my my idea, you know I'm trying something for the planets in our solar system, not for exoplanets, but I think maybe it's worth of trying for exoplanets.",

So I think I always think it's most important to focus on the non-equilibrium reactions because those are not easy to model and radical chemistry is not easy to solve and anything that's kind of messy I think more easily studied in the lab. So like if planetary scientists could give us, you know, a top five list of things that would be cool to know about, that then we would go do all the experiments, but it's hard to know what to focus on sometimes because you read papers about early earth was like this or Mars is like that and then you do five years of experiments and then it's like no actually the atmosphere is this actually. And you're like, oh man, that would have changed everything and so it is just a difficult sometimes to know what conditions to begin.",
