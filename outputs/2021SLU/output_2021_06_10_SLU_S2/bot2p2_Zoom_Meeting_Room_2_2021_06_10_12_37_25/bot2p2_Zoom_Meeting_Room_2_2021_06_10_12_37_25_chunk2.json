I was even on her PhD committee many years ago and she's done many more exciting things. And I may try to um uh kind of put in um our discussion a few of the ideas she might have wanted to discuss about information as being uh one way to look at life and understanding the phenomenon of life in most general terms. Information that copies itself and that makes structures that makes itself. So it's a very interesting concept that it may help us look for it. But we can do that later in that discussion. We have an hour and something uh to discuss all these things. So shall we start from the chemistry, which is one way to do it or shall we start from the other side, which is the astronomy astronomy? So we can also do astrochemistry, of course, but uh um since we have a few chemists here, what do the chemists think?",

And I think that per Dimitar's comment about um, you know, how is this even relevant to life on earth? I think that the other solvent question could be relevant to life on earth because, you know, from some of uh for instance like McHugh's work, uh there's been work on kind of hypersaline environments and alternative solvents that come from a lot of solute from an aqueous solution that when you concentrate it, you have something that's still liquid that you can do interesting chemistry in.",

I think we think of it as something that happened and then there was life. But I think that it's worth considering it as we think of these questions as kind of a progress bar for the emergence of life, you know, we go from low complexity to kind of what Dimitar is talking about higher complexity. Um and I think that that might kind of inform some of our thinking about, you know, we're talking about with exoplanets. Uh and then finally the last two are kind of related. Um there's going to obviously be some geochemical constraints on what kind of protobiomolecules emerge and that's going to vary from body to body. Um and this is going to have uh you know, impacts from a chemical perspective in terms of, you know, what surfaces are presented and what kind of chemistry you can do on the surfaces.",
