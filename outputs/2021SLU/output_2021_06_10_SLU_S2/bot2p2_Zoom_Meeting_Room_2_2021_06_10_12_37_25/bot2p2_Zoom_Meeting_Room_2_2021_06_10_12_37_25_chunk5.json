So then he has to like derive it from the molecule and this takes them a really long time. And then the other issue was it was equilibrium modeling and our experiments not in equilibrium. And also the modeling would tell us stability of a product at a condition, but it didn't take into account the instability of the molecule, like we were talking about. And so there was nowhere in the model to input the fact that like this molecule degrades at a well known exponential curve that we see in the lab, but that's not included in the model. So it was I didn't realize it would be this challenging.",
