Um, so that's a first idea, not saying it's necessarily the one.",

So could could exoplanet or planetary science people make a list of which parameters are most variable between different planets, because that would allow you to say which planet could or could not do a thing. And then the chemists could make which parameters are most effective in changing the way a chemical reaction turns out, because you know, certain ones you change in the lab it is not that big of a deal. Other ones you change it, it changes everything. And where that overlap is could be, you know, a shorter list where we could focus in the lab. Like if for example it turned out that massive differences in the amount of methane in the atmosphere are going to exist, but methane also really controls all of organic chemistry. That would be a thing to focus on. But then other things like maybe wouldn't.",

Like I mean, you know, from an astronomer perspective, UV flux changes dramatically both on short time scales and on long time scales, right? And we can I can measure that for stars that have exoplanets around them, right? So I can give you the UV flux from a star on hours, minutes, hours, days, years, right? And then if that is something that influences say this dimer that Aaron's talking about, then, you know, you can take that as an input, right? That's a very simple experiment nested within this larger Venn diagram, which I think is worth making as well to like find where all of those are.",

So uh, you have some like, you know, uh, like you know, a very very short short scale and for the modeling I think maybe uh, uh, you know, you guys learned about that is is not easy to do that. But well I think we can definitely try if it's worth is very important and very interesting. Um, and we we can design some model system to study that. You know, we we have done some like a model organic compound that we know exactly what kinds of radicals can be formed and then we can use some you know different uh parameters, right? And to examine how the radicals, you know, form maybe some chain reactions over time and uh yeah, to make things a little bit simpler at the beginning. So.",
