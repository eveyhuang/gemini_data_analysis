So if it's too stable and then it may not be able to transfer like water or organic material to the terrestrial planets. And also from the earlier on stage, so it will be interesting to see like what's the chemical distribution along the radius of the system since the temperature difference is really large and the metallicity or this um not perhaps not metallicity but just um how the chemical ingredients would mix inside this protoplanetary disc and form its planets and then further on how the instability of this planetary system may transfer this um materials from outside to inside and vice versa and how this will distribute and allow complex life to emerge.",

You know, under specific conditions. And the second question is how stable those molecules can be, right? Maybe the cells protiles, you know, maybe uh over like millions of years for for example. I think there are two processes and it could be like competing process as well, right? Maybe like they're forming the organics, but they're also degrading at the same time. Um, I I think also, you know, it's very important like Laurie says, the modeling is very important because for the experimental studies, uh we can only conduct maybe like months or maybe years, but uh it's not, you know, long enough to really predict what's going on, right? In the geologic time. Uh I think for the geochemist, we we have some models that can predict what is going to happen at equilibrium um states, but uh um but the time scale actually, I think it's a big question mark there.
