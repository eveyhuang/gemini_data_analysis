Um my sense was that if you did work on a truly ocean planet in which the ocean is 10 miles deep everywhere, uh, some of that work uh on how the crust and the mantle and all that activity related to plate tectonics of volcanoes or magma provinces, uh, will spill over on some of our understanding of the early earth, which was not that case, but was in some cases some processes might have been similar because there was much less uh dry land. It's just a hunch that this hasn't been done and we may not we may be missing something interesting there. But otherwise you're right. A very deep ocean changes you know, obviously the dynamics of many things including weathering, of course.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, to pick up uh sort of the chat going on with with with uh Laura and Brad inside there, you know, what what terrestrial clays give you is carbon burial in the oceans. So you know, carbon burial in the oceans didn't really pick up until plants colonized land uh and started generating big clays, lots of open sites on them that really grabbed carbon and and accelerated uh clay burial. So yeah, you know, I'm everyone we started our conversation today really worried about the flux of material up out of these uh water world oceans and I'm really worried about the uh the the the flux of material down and recycling. Uh if you can't bring carbon down efficiently because you're not generating uh you know, if if you're just generating clays in hydrothermal vents in these submarine volcanoes, uh those are the the sort of early earth clays. Um, you know, the the I guess the calinites really that are are uh and you know, maybe some light or something that is they're not the good carbon bearing clays. So they're they're super inefficient. So maybe these worlds are just really slow, maybe they need a lot of time.",

Um, so I do you just end up with a Venus state pretty pretty easily. Um, but anyway, something to think about, but I just want to make sure that in the time we have available, we we do return to the the bio part of this biogeochemical process. I think we've been uh for good reason focusing on on the physical and the chemical, um, biology has been touched on a few times but but maybe we can bring things back to that that theme a little bit.",

So I think uh in a way the question of how much do you need biology to do things like tectonics or how much does this does it actually influence uh as a second idea that you guys you know brought up, you know, how much does it actually influence an atmosphere or the whole nature of a planet. You know, who wants to venture a guess because that's what it's going to be but you know, an interesting guess nevertheless.",

So would biology even help you to address Joe Joe's question of uh sedimentation and and and uh particularly CO2 export, um even if you had the ability to form uh biology that's going to be locking some of those things into um calcium carbonates and domites and and and similar kinds of materials, can they even be exported if you reach a critical depth of the ocean.",

If the concentration of carbon, maybe carbon dioxide increase in the atmosphere, the greenhouse effect will increase. That's mean the surface temperature will increase. Then we are evaporated liquid water to the atmosphere. Liquid water, you know, water vapor is also greenhouse gas. It will increase the temperature again. You know, it's some some positive feedback between the concentration of atmosphere. I mean carbon concentration of atmosphere and the temperature. So that's one reason why lost ocean because the positive feedback.",

If you know if uh if the pathway gets cut off to something like, you know, whether it's because of the dissolment of CO2 or something else, you know, again, this is speculative, but is there something else that you could envision as a different geochemical feedback or biological geochemical feedback that we haven't explored that maybe even worked on early Mars or I don't know, you know, worked on Venus at one point when it was just so much CO2 rich. Maybe where could you go? I think that's another really interesting thing to think about too. And then does anybody work on biota that also use other uh biogeochemical ways to get stuff or eat stuff or not eat stuff? I don't know, hydrogen eating bacteria or I don't know.
