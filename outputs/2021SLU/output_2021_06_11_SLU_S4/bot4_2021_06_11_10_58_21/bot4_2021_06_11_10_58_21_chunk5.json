Um, you know, late accretion, you're going to accrete for the earth something like 0.01% of the earth's mass. Um, if you're delivering that into your ocean, are you delivering nutrients there? Um, and then the other random question is maybe for Joe is like, what would sedimentary processes look like in a purely ocean world? Do you have a sedimentary cycle?",

Yeah, I really worry about that second one because if we're relying on whatever ocean currents you have, I mean, these are some of the these are not efficient eroders of the the the growing submarine volcanoes, you know, subaerial environments really generate sediment and transport that sediment. Um, so you know, sedimentation in the open ocean is is very small even on a a planet like ours and and much of that depending where you are is is, you know, biogenic. So, um, yeah, I worry about the recycling. I just, you know, my I I think I suggested this maybe in one of the small groups the other day, but I I just worry about all these water worlds turning into giant closed basin lakes and material builds up in the oceans and and never is recycled out. Um, and they they just become too saline for anything to live in them.",

            "transcript": "a related issue is that uh in Earth's ocean, things like phosphorus and other ingredients for for life can be used thousand times or more before they're ultimately buried in in marine sediments. And that's largely thanks to ocean circulation patterns and upwelling in in particular. Um, but I think that if you had a really deep ocean, the connectivity between the the bottom of the ocean where the ingredients for life should tend to gravitationally accumulate, um and the and the surface ocean could become quite different. Like our relatively shallow ocean mixes on a thousand year time scale. If you had a really, really deep ocean, maybe that's tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of years or more. Um, so that's potentially inherently limiting in terms of of biospheric productivity.",

If you had ice layers here and there, there you can concentrate them because then you don't dilute in the big ocean and you melt a little bit and in addition you get the tactic concentration. So Laura, it's not a crazy idea except, you know, you have to do the math and the dilution factors. Christopher, you have your hand raised.",

I I think the the the stratification of of two radically different biospheres on a planet is is a really cool issue and my understanding as a humble volcanologist for what happens on on earth is that there there has been considerable movement of very early formed methanogens and methanotrophs from these deep and then surface and then back to deep environments.

It's it's a terrible environment for physical weathering and disaggregation of rock. So I think I think generation of sediments is a giant problem here still. You know, those continental shelves are loaded with terrestrial sediments on earth and then of course they fail in in dramatic and exciting ways.",

It's terrestrially derived sediment that builds up on the shelf and then fails as turbidites every 500 years in Oregon. Sorry, West Coast folks. Um, so it's you know, I think that predominantly. So I I I would expect it to be very, very slow, you know, I would expect to see cross-bedded water world shales with mud and clay size sediments, but I wouldn't, you know, that and I would expect to see turbidites close to our underwater Olympus Mons. Um, but I think that's a very small fraction of of the sediment budget that you get on a mixed terrestrial aquatic world like ours.",

Uh, and it's relevant not just to some exotic super ocean planets, but it may be relevant to the early earth because some people think that it took a while for continents to show up.
