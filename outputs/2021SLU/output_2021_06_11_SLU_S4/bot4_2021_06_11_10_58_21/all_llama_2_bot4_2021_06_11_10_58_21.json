Um, the first thing was kind of I'm still working out how I can fit in here, like so my research focuses on the emergence of complex life, rather than the emergence of unicellular life and from what I've learned yesterday, it seems like when we're looking for planets in other, you know, in other elsewhere in the galaxy that might harbor life, there's no easy ways to discriminate between complex and sort of simple life forms and how they may be affecting the environment. But, um, I'm becoming very, very interested in water and water worlds. So a lot of my research is learning how early organisms like evolved to a life and adaptations to a life in the fluid environment. Um, and it's, you know, it's very, very clever the way they've done it. And so I'm fascinated by the planetary processes within planetary formation that lead to uh, the precipitation of water on the surface and what other liquids might you have. Like, you know, when we think about sort of water worlds and fluid worlds and so on, what other chemistries are out there? And I guess in my mind I'm wondering how might organisms deal or evolve or adapt to a life in fluids that aren't necessarily H2O. And what are the processes that lead to that?",

Is it something completely different? Um, in terms of what you see at the surface of an inhabited planet. Uh, and then the other side of it is, you know, how deterministic are these processes? Uh, you know, we all got into natural sciences because we like mechanical systems. Um, but uh, you know, what do all inhabited planets look similar?

You know, can we form the same kind of environments needed for the origin of life on planets with different tectonic states or do you need plate tectonics and then how does that affect life's evolution on that planet and potential bio signatures?

Um, as opposed to considering all planets because I I I I heard oceans a lot here. Um, just stemming from a little bit of what we talked about yesterday, I I I went off on a a tangent of research in in the evening trying to look more specifically at this concept that we were thinking about in terms of um considering classes of world based on the information that they contain in terms of the number of different states. And that's a a form of information, it's a information entropy. Um, but there's actually another form of information that could be very interesting uh and that's mutual information. So if you think about that in the context of an ecosystem, um if you were to look at either geological component of that ecosystem or biological component, what would be your reduction in uncertainty about knowing about the other uh actors or components by making that observation. So for instance if you saw a particular um chemical composition or if you saw a particular uh microbial uh either individual microbial species or an ecology, what is your reduction in uncertainty about other parts of that system? What what is the mutual information contained in an ecosystem and that might be another another direction.",

I'm not completely up on the latest on those, but so this idea that the biosphere actually can incredibly influence the planet is also out there and there's a lot of tension currently because there are some people say, well, there could be a tiny bit of life that doesn't do anything and the planet just happily evolves on like without life. And there are other ideas that actually say as soon as you get life, it will change everything because it would be everywhere. And so I think the ideas that you put out, you know, in terms of how the geology actually interacts with life, how that would change if you have those geology even if we're active in the core of an ocean world like and maybe even have like an ice layer attached to it. What would the volcanoes do and so on. So I think there's a lot of really great ideas here. So, um, do you want to put some couple of words out and then we just go at it.",

And then yesterday I had the first discussion with Greg, uh, from MIT and he said, no, this is the outlier or this is most likely outlier. He actually wrote a paper about this that I hadn't seen. And so now I'm like in the stage where I'm like, so does it change the tectonics? Does it change how the planet moves and does, you know, whether there's volcanism or not or what about, um, so this is like in my head.

So, uh, the idea has always been that we can separate the coupling and figure out what a non biologically coupled geological activities. I mean, that's how we teach it, no? Uh, but are we fooling ourselves? Is it that there are a lot of processes which based on our, you know, geological record, uh, we interpret that way, but we don't account for the bio feedback. Most of the earth's geological record is, uh, during a very strong biosphere. It is true that the very early record, uh, as Greg, for me, I would say is not that indicative of strong feedback, but then we have so little of it. So a lot of, uh, our geology and geophysics may be based on some false premises because it's based on the recent record where it's very recent being the last two billion years. So maybe we, uh, really need Mars to have never had life so that we can figure this out so that if we get the full record of a rocky planet with no life feedback, we can figure the geological activity on its own.",

Let me just throw one last thing in here because this discussion is I think really important and really, really useful, but let me throw a devil's advocate thing in here. If you were around an M star that evolves very, very, very slowly, you might not need the geochemical feedback, so like a silicon, uh, carbon silicon cycle to maintain habitability on your planet because for quite a long time because that star evolves so slowly, you would be nice and warm. Well, if you're on a G star like we are around the earth, you do need that feedback critically or it's going to be way too cold first and then way too hot. So this is how the CO2 in our atmosphere things.

So yeah, you know, I'm everyone we started our conversation today really worried about the flux of material up out of these uh water world oceans and I'm really worried about the uh the the the flux of material down and recycling. Uh if you can't bring carbon down efficiently because you're not generating uh you know, if if you're just generating clays in hydrothermal vents in these submarine volcanoes, uh those are the the sort of early earth clays. Um, you know, the the I guess the calinites really that are are uh and you know, maybe some light or something that is they're not the good carbon bearing clays. So they're they're super inefficient.

Um, although we also don't know like the initial condition, you know, it might be more likely that if planets have go through a magma ocean phase that they would tend to start with volatiles out gas to the surface. Um, I know Laura would know more about that than I do. Um, but yeah, so but if you if there was some for somehow how it formed or its initial condition, the planet started dry at the surface but had water in the interior and it had a stagnant lid, I would expect it to generally just be outgassing water over time and build up an ocean but not easily recycle that back into the interior.",

Um, it doesn't like to be in the the the melt. Um, so you get most of your carbon out of the mantle really quickly unless you're more reduced. So the more reduced your mantle is, the more soluble your carbon is. Uh, so you'll tend to retain it um in the mantle.

Um, I'm having a hard time picturing how this is going to fit and I have a couple of uh bullet point slides. Um, also I guess the other thing that came up as people were referring to this is can can an ocean world ever get to um out of an anoxic state and build up enough oxygen to be able to have different forms of metabolism that are key for for at least what we know of as complex life. So do you ever have a situation potentially uh there's an advantage to not having uh extrusives that even though you have uh a lot of potential uh movement of uh the mantle you're not extruding out new material that needs to be oxidized, no new metals are being transported and erupted at the surface. Um, does that actually help you to oxygenate the the ocean because the the water uh may have oxygen but isn't necessarily um oxidizing uh the the metals if if you're not supplying them like we do on on earth to the surface.",

So I think uh for the ideas that I would report out, but again, it's all of you like this idea of water worlds could actually provide conditions for life stably from the interior all the way to how the oceans would interact.
