            "transcript": "also this idea of how biology actually interacts with the mantle and if volcanism is essential and what it actually means, there were some kind of papers early on that actually said because we have bacteria, it actually easier to break the crust and start tectonics or maintain tectonics. I'm not completely up on the latest on those, but so this idea that the biosphere actually can incredibly influence the planet is also out there and there's a lot of tension currently because there are some people say, well, there could be a tiny bit of life that doesn't do anything and the planet just happily evolves on like without life. And there are other ideas that actually say as soon as you get life, it will change everything because it would be everywhere. And so I think the ideas that you put out, you know, in terms of how the geology actually interacts with life, how that would change if you have those geology even if we're active in the core of an ocean world like and maybe even have like an ice layer attached to it. What would the volcanoes do and so on. So I think there's a lot of really great ideas here. So, um, do you want to put some couple of words out and then we just go at it.",

I, uh, everybody I talked to so far said that once biology gets started, it changes the planet completely and it actually can change like it did for us, right? The atmosphere. And then yesterday I had the first discussion with Greg, uh, from MIT and he said, no, this is the outlier or this is most likely outlier. He actually wrote a paper about this that I hadn't seen. And so now I'm like in the stage where I'm like, so does it change the tectonics? Does it change how the planet moves and does, you know, whether there's volcanism or not or what about, um, so this is like in my head. So I was like, I hope you all are going to solve this for me in the next 45 minutes because no discussion for the last 40 years.",

            "transcript": "That that's funny, but I wrote the same thing except in a different way. So the way I wrote it is, uh, are we fooling ourselves? So basically the idea is about the coupling. So, uh, the idea has always been that we can separate the coupling and figure out what a non biologically coupled geological activities. I mean, that's how we teach it, no? Uh, but are we fooling ourselves? Is it that there are a lot of processes which based on our, you know, geological record, uh, we interpret that way, but we don't account for the bio feedback. Most of the earth's geological record is, uh, during a very strong biosphere. It is true that the very early record, uh, as Greg, for me, I would say is not that indicative of strong feedback, but then we have so little of it. So a lot of, uh, our geology and geophysics may be based on some false premises because it's based on the recent record where it's very recent being the last two billion years. So maybe we, uh, really need Mars to have never had life so that we can figure this out so that if we get the full record of a rocky planet with no life feedback, we can figure the geological activity on its own.",

Let me just throw one last thing in here because this discussion is I think really important and really, really useful, but let me throw a devil's advocate thing in here. If you were around an M star that evolves very, very, very slowly, you might not need the geochemical feedback, so like a silicon, uh, carbon silicon cycle to maintain habitability on your planet because for quite a long time because that star evolves so slowly, you would be nice and warm. Well, if you're on a G star like we are around the earth, you do need that feedback critically or it's going to be way too cold first and then way too hot. So this is how the CO2 in our atmosphere things. And so the thing in the back of your mind that when we're talking about this differences, it might also be very different around depending on which kind of sun you have in your star.",

Um, and maybe even, you know, enough to stabilize high density ices and whatnot, which I mean if that shuts down volcanism and water rock interaction. I I see that as kind of a dead end for for life.",
