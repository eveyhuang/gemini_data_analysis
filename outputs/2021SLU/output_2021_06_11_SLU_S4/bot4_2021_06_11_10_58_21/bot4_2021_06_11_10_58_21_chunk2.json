Um, the first thing was kind of I'm still working out how I can fit in here, like so my research focuses on the emergence of complex life, rather than the emergence of unicellular life and from what I've learned yesterday, it seems like when we're looking for planets in other, you know, in other elsewhere in the galaxy that might harbor life, there's no easy ways to discriminate between complex and sort of simple life forms and how they may be affecting the environment. But, um, I'm becoming very, very interested in water and water worlds. So a lot of my research is learning how early organisms like evolved to a life and adaptations to a life in the fluid environment. Um, and it's, you know, it's very, very clever the way they've done it. And so I'm fascinated by the planetary processes within planetary formation that lead to uh, the precipitation of water on the surface and what other liquids might you have. Like, you know, when we think about sort of water worlds and fluid worlds and so on, what other chemistries are out there? And I guess in my mind I'm wondering how might organisms deal or evolve or adapt to a life in fluids that aren't necessarily H2O. And what are the processes that lead to that?",

One one of them is sort of how should we be conceptualizing this relationship between geology and biological systems and coevolution? Is is it a tug of war? Is it forcing feedback? Is it something completely different? Um, in terms of what you see at the surface of an inhabited planet. Uh, and then the other side of it is, you know, how deterministic are these processes? Uh, you know, we all got into natural sciences because we like mechanical systems. Um, but uh, you know, what do all inhabited planets look similar? It's sort of picking up from our thread yesterday where we we said sometimes yes and sometimes no. So I'd like to hear your all thoughts on that.",

So my uh kind of pet idea that I've always been interested in for many years and do some work on is how how does a planet's tectonic mode, like whether it has plate tectonics or a stagnant lid like Mars or something in between like Venus might be, how does that influence whether life can originate and evolve on that planet? You know, can we form the same kind of environments needed for the origin of life on planets with different tectonic states or do you need plate tectonics and then how does that affect life's evolution on that planet and potential bio signatures? Like can you have a great oxygenation event on planets in different tectonic modes or is that tied to the plate tectonics and you know, how what kind of bio signatures might be, you know, better or not better on different kinds of planets with different um tectonic and interior states.",

Um, uh, and I mean I I like to think about this transition from sort of less complex to more complex life. Um, and so that's something we think about in terms of physiology, like how do you go from being able to do simple things to to um building complexity. Um, and then I think that's where I struggle is how to sort of connect those ideas to um sort of um uh geological activity. Um, and certainly when we get to exoplanets, um, but I also really like Stephanie's point of um can we have life on a totally water world? Um, how do you get the gradients that you need? Um, can you get the gradients that you need um without plate tectonics as well. Um, and so I think I think there are ways um in which I sort of fit um but I'm still thinking sort of about the the best thing I can contribute here.",

That's mean maybe in the future Mars will have maybe volcanic activities again. That's mean it will bring a lot of atmosphere, I mean develop atmosphere and increase the temperature of the surface of of a Mars. That's mean the Mars temperature maybe is suitable for the liquid water and life in the future. So I just wonder what's the role, important role of volcanic activity in the development of life and liquid water in other planets. That's my idea.",

Um, as opposed to considering all planets because I I I I heard oceans a lot here. Um, just stemming from a little bit of what we talked about yesterday, I I I went off on a a tangent of research in in the evening trying to look more specifically at this concept that we were thinking about in terms of um considering classes of world based on the information that they contain in terms of the number of different states. And that's a a form of information, it's a information entropy. Um, but there's actually another form of information that could be very interesting uh and that's mutual information. So if you think about that in the context of an ecosystem, um if you were to look at either geological component of that ecosystem or biological component, what would be your reduction in uncertainty about knowing about the other uh actors or components by making that observation. So for instance if you saw a particular um chemical composition or if you saw a particular uh microbial uh either individual microbial species or an ecology, what is your reduction in uncertainty about other parts of that system? What what is the mutual information contained in an ecosystem and that might be another another direction.",
