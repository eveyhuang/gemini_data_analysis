Um, the first thing was kind of I'm still working out how I can fit in here, like so my research focuses on the emergence of complex life, rather than the emergence of unicellular life and from what I've learned yesterday, it seems like when we're looking for planets in other, you know, in other elsewhere in the galaxy that might harbor life, there's no easy ways to discriminate between complex and sort of simple life forms and how they may be affecting the environment. But, um, I'm becoming very, very interested in water and water worlds. So a lot of my research is learning how early organisms like evolved to a life and adaptations to a life in the fluid environment. Um, and it's, you know, it's very, very clever the way they've done it. And so I'm fascinated by the planetary processes within planetary formation that lead to uh, the precipitation of water on the surface and what other liquids might you have. Like, you know, when we think about sort of water worlds and fluid worlds and so on, what other chemistries are out there? And I guess in my mind I'm wondering how might organisms deal or evolve or adapt to a life in fluids that aren't necessarily H2O. And what are the processes that lead to that? ",

Um, as opposed to considering all planets because I I I I heard oceans a lot here. Um, just stemming from a little bit of what we talked about yesterday, I I I went off on a a tangent of research in in the evening trying to look more specifically at this concept that we were thinking about in terms of um considering classes of world based on the information that they contain in terms of the number of different states. And that's a a form of information, it's a information entropy. Um, but there's actually another form of information that could be very interesting uh and that's mutual information. So if you think about that in the context of an ecosystem, um if you were to look at either geological component of that ecosystem or biological component, what would be your reduction in uncertainty about knowing about the other uh actors or components by making that observation.
