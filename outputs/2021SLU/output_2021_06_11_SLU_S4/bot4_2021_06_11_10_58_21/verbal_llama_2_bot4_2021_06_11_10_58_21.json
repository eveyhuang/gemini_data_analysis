But, um, I'm becoming very, very interested in water and water worlds. So a lot of my research is learning how early organisms like evolved to a life and adaptations to a life in the fluid environment. Um, and it's, you know, it's very, very clever the way they've done it.

Um, as opposed to considering all planets because I I I I heard oceans a lot here. Um, just stemming from a little bit of what we talked about yesterday, I I I went off on a a tangent of research in in the evening trying to look more specifically at this concept that we were thinking about in terms of um considering classes of world based on the information that they contain in terms of the number of different states. And that's a a form of information, it's a information entropy. Um, but there's actually another form of information that could be very interesting uh and that's mutual information. So if you think about that in the context of an ecosystem, um if you were to look at either geological component of that ecosystem or biological component, what would be your reduction in uncertainty about knowing about the other uh actors or components by making that observation. So for instance if you saw a particular um chemical composition or if you saw a particular uh microbial uh either individual microbial species or an ecology, what is your reduction in uncertainty about other parts of that system?

I'm not completely up on the latest on those, but so this idea that the biosphere actually can incredibly influence the planet is also out there and there's a lot of tension currently because there are some people say, well, there could be a tiny bit of life that doesn't do anything and the planet just happily evolves on like without life. And there are other ideas that actually say as soon as you get life, it will change everything because it would be everywhere. And so I think the ideas that you put out, you know, in terms of how the geology actually interacts with life, how that would change if you have those geology even if we're active in the core of an ocean world like and maybe even have like an ice layer attached to it.

I mean, that's how we teach it, no? Uh, but are we fooling ourselves?

Most of the earth's geological record is, uh, during a very strong biosphere. It is true that the very early record, uh, as Greg, for me, I would say is not that indicative of strong feedback, but then we have so little of it. So a lot of, uh, our geology and geophysics may be based on some false premises because it's based on the recent record where it's very recent being the last two billion years.
