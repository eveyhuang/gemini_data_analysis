So they have a lot of heat and you might be moving it towards the surface and potentially if you're not generating partial melt, you you you could get a stagnant lid. But but is that stable? Or or are you potentially uh moving heat through the interior and and and sort of setting the stage for a major overturning event. Um so that you might not have C4 spreading in the way that we have it now, but you're building up uh this heat that can't get out effectively. You're building up a convective lid and and that heat which is still being produced in the interior might end up just elevating to the point that you you have a catastrophic overturning event underneath the ocean which would has some pretty profound ramifications for uh any life that happened to be clinging on and in that stagnant lid before the the overturn event.",

Um, is there is there a limit to um uh life and the cycles that at least the way we understand it on earth, it seems like there would potentially be a limit especially when life is first um forming in a in a purely water world, like depending on circulation and a number of other things. Um but also like developing cycles in a really deep ocean is somewhat difficult to imagine. So I just I just wonder philosophically if there's is that depth limit.",

So I want to make sure that because when um you probably didn't have time to see it, but it started with Laura pointing out that there is a paper that discussed some of these issues. I would have to say that I heard some of your ideas which go beyond what is in this paper and find it very interesting. And uh I agree that hotspot type volcanics particularly in a not so deep uh water layer will be should be uh there. But I was wondering continuing on on what Chris was saying and I actually Christopher I'll give you the in a moment the words on that is uh whether we can have events which are indeed overturn events like the deon traps or things where uh on the bottom of that ocean you will have such big um overturn events that they will change the chemistry of the entire ocean despite this very large volume.",

But if you have such an overturn event, you would actually be able to start mixing these areas and you would bring new chemistry in. And so that would be uh very interesting, you know, would it be spotwise as you said like everything is like Hawaii, I think I saw on the chat. But uh or would it actually be enough to actually would it be localized for life or not? I think nobody nobody that I know have thought about this uh at all and I think it's a very interesting question um what could happen when you turn up the energy.",
