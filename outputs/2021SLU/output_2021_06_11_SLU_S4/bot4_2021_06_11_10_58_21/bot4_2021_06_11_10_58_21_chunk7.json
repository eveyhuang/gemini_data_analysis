If we actually envisioning that there is no way to get rid of CO2 on these kind of planets, then we would imagine with this feedback, you know, it getting hotter and hotter and hotter to basically say if we find a water world, the first thing we could check is whether or not it looks like a Venus, even if it's like at a nice temperate environment, just if you want to take it further. But you know, of course you have to play through what an evolution would be, but I think that would be giving you something concrete to test against.",

Uh, could could you imagine that um, uh, this type of feedback, bio feedback could reverse what we typically think of rocky planets stuck on a particular orbit around a particular star that they tend to lose water or get drier with time. Could we reverse that for some planets? You start dry with a little bit of water on the surface and as uh the system evolves, it gets more and more water on the surface mostly from its mantle reservoir and it ends up being an ocean planet when it already had uh biota develop on it. Is that at all possible? I don't think anybody has considered that kind of a reverse way of doing it.",

There's some kind of weird, probably hard ways, but no real easy way to recycle water back into the mantle because you don't have subduction zones. So I'd expect a stagnant lid planet and this actually would be regardless of whether it's has biology or not to you know, they could start drier at the surface and outgas water over time. Um, although we also don't know like the initial condition, you know, it might be more likely that if planets have go through a magma ocean phase that they would tend to start with volatiles out gas to the surface. Um, I know Laura would know more about that than I do. Um, but yeah, so but if you if there was some for somehow how it formed or its initial condition, the planet started dry at the surface but had water in the interior and it had a stagnant lid, I would expect it to generally just be outgassing water over time and build up an ocean but not easily recycle that back into the interior.",

Um, it doesn't like to be in the the the melt. Um, so you get most of your carbon out of the mantle really quickly unless you're more reduced. So the more reduced your mantle is, the more soluble your carbon is. Uh, so you'll tend to retain it um in the mantle. Um, and you can still get water outgassing even in a in a reduced mantle, but you might that might be accompanied by some hydrogen in your atmosphere as well.",

Um, we've covered a lot of ground and maybe if we could begin thinking a little bit about where the synthesis actually comes from. I think we have a focus in terms of topic. Um, I'm having a hard time picturing how this is going to fit and I have a couple of uh bullet point slides. Um, also I guess the other thing that came up as people were referring to this is can can an ocean world ever get to um out of an anoxic state and build up enough oxygen to be able to have different forms of metabolism that are key for for at least what we know of as complex life. So do you ever have a situation potentially uh there's an advantage to not having uh extrusives that even though you have uh a lot of potential uh movement of uh the mantle you're not extruding out new material that needs to be oxidized, no new metals are being transported and erupted at the surface. Um, does that actually help you to oxygenate the the ocean because the the water uh may have oxygen but isn't necessarily um oxidizing uh the the metals if if you're not supplying them like we do on on earth to the surface.",
