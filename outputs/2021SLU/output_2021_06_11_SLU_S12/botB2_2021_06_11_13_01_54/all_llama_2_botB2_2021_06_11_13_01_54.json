Um, and this is sort of analogous to the Jupiter system which I work on where you have IO, it's putting out all this material because Jupiter's magnetic field is so strong that material is lost from IO's atmosphere. So it sort of makes IO's habitability worse, but then the material gets spread throughout the entire system deposited on the other moons and this this transport of material via magnetic field happens in all four of the giant planet systems. Um, and that material for example on the surface of Europa then um you get these like radiolytically produced oxidants that are thought to to then diffuse through the ice shell and be potential nutrients for life. And so the this transport of material from another planet in the system combined with the stellar magnetic field has the potential to alter the conditions on the surface of one of the other planets and affect its habitability.",

Um, one thing that I wanted to throw in, so I uh, I think Meredith Meredith was saying this, right? Is this uh Jupiter planets and giant planets? This is really great paper that that the Jupiter friend or foe. This is why I remember that paper, they are lots of them, but this is where I remember the title where they were basically coming up with a giant planet on the outside is uh is a wash, I think, that's where but uh Katherine, you you know this way better than me that uh that giant planet, you know, shelters us from some of the impacts but also brings things towards us. So, uh, but it's an interesting question is like where do you have to position these giant planets, right? For it to be helpful or hurtful if there's something there.",

On the earth, we have life down to kilometers. So sterilizing the earth is actually not you would have to melt it down to a couple of kilometers to sterilize the earth. Sterilizing the surface of the earth is doable, but sterilizing the earth is not doable very easily. And so you need a huge impact to be able to do that. So that's good news for life. But when we have this discussion, I think just one thing to throw in, it's perfectly fine to say, you know, you can sterilize a planet as long as when we're reporting out or when we think about it is when we talk about radiation, we talk about the surface. And so if we're in the ocean or if we subsurface, that will be a completely different story. And so these paths of lives could diverge and you could think about when you talk about the galactic habitable zone, you can think about it as a part where we can remotely detect life because it made it to the surface and thus actually change the atmosphere considerably or if it never made it to the surface, does it still change the atmosphere the surface so we can see it, right? And so but I wanted to just bring this in because a lot of times the conversation will be different. And so um but I think this idea is about uh all these different parts together. It sounds sounds great. So I will throw it to the one non astronomer to get us started on this. So Bradford, you saw that coming, right? So um why don't you just I don't know, throw out something that you want to talk about and we're just going to go at it.",

Um, very well done to minus one, but if if Dan is telling me that the low minus four, I'm sure we're fine. Um, so M dwarfs are much, much, much more difficult because our understanding of molecular opacities is really terrible. Um, and in order to get around that is really going to take an investment in laboratory astrophysics. Um, but our community doesn't tend to enjoy funding laboratory astrophysicists, so it's it's a little bit of a tricky um game to play. Um, the and there's been a lot of um recent work done on M dwarf um characterization uh with machine learning. Um, so I think that that we're going to see a big explosion in M dwarf characterization um with machine learning techniques. Often times people find M dwarfs in pairs with wide binary pairs with F G K stars and my group has done a lot of work really trying to show that, okay, that these these um wide binary pairs are in fact really homogeneous so you can attach the chemistry of say the F G K star in the pair which is easy to the M dwarf which is not so easy and then that will allow us to actually do um build train sets and then do machine learning on on the. I think M dwarf metallicities are still there's still a lot to be desired there, but bulk metallicities I think are fine chemical compositions on M dwarfs probably not so fine.",

I mean things like masses I guess you can sort of get fairly easily, but there was no this whole star planet connection seem to not apply to the disc structures and that was always fascinating to me and I don't know what the latest on this is, but I mean young stars are really hard. I guess the best bet would we currently do is you use associations, right? You use the groups of stars together to get an age and then a mass and a temperature.

And like I've been really interested in, you know, differences between like A type stars and later type stars because the A type stars are where we find all these giant directly image planets and they seem to have some slightly different disc properties like they hang on to gas for a lot longer and they have more massive discs and it seems like they might even have like different collisional properties and size distributions of bodies in their discs and so, you know, like the reach there would be to say, you know, I bet you could try and say something about like planet formation efficiency around different spectral type stars, you know, based on a variety of properties and my instinct is that there should be something there, but that we haven't gotten there yet.",

Um, unless they're just born with like hardly any heat producing elements and are in, you know, some orbit configuration where they get like no tidal heating. Um, there's some ideas about um as there's like a couple papers saying that really massive super earth planets if they have stagnant lids might not have volcanism at all because any melt you'd form would form at such high pressure because it's beneath this thick stagnant lid and it's a high gravity planet so the pressure gradient's really high so then the forming really high pressure there's a pressure crossover where melt is actually denser than solid and it wouldn't rise up and erupt anymore. But I also think that result's kind of like really heavily model and parameter dependent and so I wouldn't necessarily take that as like a really general, you know, big super earth planets are always going to have trouble outgassing. So yeah, I mean I would generally expect like most I would expect your typical rocky planet to have volcanism at least at some point in its history. Um, it might die out really on if it doesn't have a lot of heat producing elements and if it has a stagnant lid, but there's probably going to be at least some volcanism. And if you got a lot of tidal heating in some pack system then that's probably going to be volcanically active for a very long time.",
