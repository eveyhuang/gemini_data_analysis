Um then we talked a little bit about um the abundances of stars and um connecting that with the abundance of planets. We talked a little bit about this in a different order. Um so we talked about the condensation temperature uh work that's been done. We talked about um spectra of lava worlds, uh white dwarf planet debris. Um and then we just recently talked about the galactic habitable zone. What do people think are the most important things that we should discuss with the group?",

And there are some people who think you want an M star so there's no real reason to think life couldn't evolve subsurface or in the ocean. And I think um if you just apply this one criteria that people fight about, you get to completely different inferences where this galactic capital zone is, but it would be really interesting to to kind of map the dependence",

But uh it's a fascinating question. Yeah, I had a really interesting discussion yesterday with uh Solange Duhamel and and she works in these like deep ocean environments like far away from the continents and was saying that life can like, you know, actually really easily do this sort of cycling and whether you'd imagine a scenario in which, you know, like the activity cycle of a star tied to like the cycling of life up and down in the ocean depth.",

Depends a little what you think what the origins of life needs, sorry. I always feel like it like it's some it's like there's a sweet spot probably. Like there's enough that it's good and like too much is bad. And then I I wonder whether that changes over time. Like over the evolution of life on earth, like maybe more of it is better early on, but then if it the level of activity is too high for too long, like it starts to become more harmful or if there is like we talked about in the like last breakout group that's like robustness of life and like how robust is life to stellar activity and is that always a constant or does that change?",
