Um, unless they're just born with like hardly any heat producing elements and are in, you know, some orbit configuration where they get like no tidal heating. Um, there's some ideas about um as there's like a couple papers saying that really massive super earth planets if they have stagnant lids might not have volcanism at all because any melt you'd form would form at such high pressure because it's beneath this thick stagnant lid and it's a high gravity planet so the pressure gradient's really high so then the forming really high pressure there's a pressure crossover where melt is actually denser than solid and it wouldn't rise up and erupt anymore. But I also think that result's kind of like really heavily model and parameter dependent and so I wouldn't necessarily take that as like a really general, you know, big super earth planets are always going to have trouble outgassing. So yeah, I mean I would generally expect like most I would expect your typical rocky planet to have volcanism at least at some point in its history. Um, it might die out really on if it doesn't have a lot of heat producing elements and if it has a stagnant lid, but there's probably going to be at least some volcanism. And if you got a lot of tidal heating in some pack system then that's probably going to be volcanically active for a very long time.",

And that that is to say, um, you know, I've been we've been thinking a lot about like, okay, so how does how can you use stars to trace planets or planet chemistry? But it's very unclear to me and it's still rather unclear to me how um planet and star chemistry are are correlated and linked.",

But uh we don't have enough information on those yet. We have the first spectra, like Laura Kreidberg took one of the first spectra of one of these lava worlds, but I don't think we have good enough information to correlate it yet, but that would be great to to do a correlation of that.",
