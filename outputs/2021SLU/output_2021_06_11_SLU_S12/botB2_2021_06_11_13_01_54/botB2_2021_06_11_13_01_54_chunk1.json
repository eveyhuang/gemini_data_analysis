I know Daniel has done it already, Meredith has done it already, so there are only a couple of options around here. Um because you only get to do it once. And so why don't we just go through the room, 30 seconds kind of who you are, what you do and then we'll take a minute to just write down what you want, what what the questions are that you have and then we'll just go through the room and then we'll discuss.

Um I am a galactic archeologist and focus on a lot of my time on trying to understand the nature and formation of the Milky Way. Um using stars as fossils, but I you know work very heavily on stellar chemistry. So I'm trained as an observational stellar spectroscopist and do a lot of stuff with combining stellar chemistry, dynamics, ages and so forth to understand Milky Way formation. But in the context of um habitability and exoplanets, um I'm I also have a strong interest in um trying to uh get a better sense for um you know how we can use stellar abundances and stellar parameters as tracers for exoplanets and exoplanet properties. So there's that common phrase, you know know thy star, know thy planet.",
