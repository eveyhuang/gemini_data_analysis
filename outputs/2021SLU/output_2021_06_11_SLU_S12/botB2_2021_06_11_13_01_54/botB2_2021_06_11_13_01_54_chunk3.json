So, but it's it's it's it's a really interesting building block because you know, my my idea generally was like the old planets or there should be rocky planets, but metallicity that it just tracked through time is is is a really cool idea too. Um, one thing that I wanted to throw in, so I uh, I think Meredith Meredith was saying this, right? Is this uh Jupiter planets and giant planets? This is really great paper that that the Jupiter friend or foe. This is why I remember that paper, they are lots of them, but this is where I remember the title where they were basically coming up with a giant planet on the outside is uh is a wash, I think, that's where but uh Katherine, you you know this way better than me that uh that giant planet, you know, shelters us from some of the impacts but also brings things towards us. So, uh, but it's an interesting question is like where do you have to position these giant planets, right? For it to be helpful or hurtful if there's something there.",

            "transcript": "So I I really like uh these kind of ideas mixed together. And one thing that I wanted to throw into the discussion, surface life and subsurface life. On the earth, we have life down to kilometers. So sterilizing the earth is actually not you would have to melt it down to a couple of kilometers to sterilize the earth. Sterilizing the surface of the earth is doable, but sterilizing the earth is not doable very easily. And so you need a huge impact to be able to do that. So that's good news for life. But when we have this discussion, I think just one thing to throw in, it's perfectly fine to say, you know, you can sterilize a planet as long as when we're reporting out or when we think about it is when we talk about radiation, we talk about the surface. And so if we're in the ocean or if we subsurface, that will be a completely different story. And so these paths of lives could diverge and you could think about when you talk about the galactic habitable zone, you can think about it as a part where we can remotely detect life because it made it to the surface and thus actually change the atmosphere considerably or if it never made it to the surface, does it still change the atmosphere the surface so we can see it, right? And so but I wanted to just bring this in because a lot of times the conversation will be different. And so um but I think this idea is about uh all these different parts together. It sounds sounds great. So I will throw it to the one non astronomer to get us started on this. So Bradford, you saw that coming, right? So um why don't you just I don't know, throw out something that you want to talk about and we're just going to go at it.",

Um, maybe and actually also with giant planets like uh, you know, the Jupiter friend or foe idea from kind of current um census of planets we have, you know, do we have enough information to start looking for trends like that in our current populations? Like I mean I guess right now it's really hard to see an actual Jupiter, maybe it's impossible to see an actual Jupiter right now. But I'm curi, you know, like I'm curious about kind of testing some of these ideas of like, oh, if you form a Jupiter like planet like in our solar system, you know, is that going to lead to um, you know, more or less habitable rocky planets closer in and you know, like where we're at in the kind of current like exoplanet population statistics to start really saying, you know, making conclusive, you know, ideas about that.",

Um, very well done to minus one, but if if Dan is telling me that the low minus four, I'm sure we're fine. Um, so M dwarfs are much, much, much more difficult because our understanding of molecular opacities is really terrible. Um, and in order to get around that is really going to take an investment in laboratory astrophysics. Um, but our community doesn't tend to enjoy funding laboratory astrophysicists, so it's it's a little bit of a tricky um game to play. Um, the and there's been a lot of um recent work done on M dwarf um characterization uh with machine learning. Um, so I think that that we're going to see a big explosion in M dwarf characterization um with machine learning techniques. Often times people find M dwarfs in pairs with wide binary pairs with F G K stars and my group has done a lot of work really trying to show that, okay, that these these um wide binary pairs are in fact really homogeneous so you can attach the chemistry of say the F G K star in the pair which is easy to the M dwarf which is not so easy and then that will allow us to actually do um build train sets and then do machine learning on on the. I think M dwarf metallicities are still there's still a lot to be desired there, but bulk metallicities I think are fine chemical compositions on M dwarfs probably not so fine.",
