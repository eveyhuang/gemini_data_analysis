I mean things like masses I guess you can sort of get fairly easily, but there was no this whole star planet connection seem to not apply to the disc structures and that was always fascinating to me and I don't know what the latest on this is, but I mean young stars are really hard. I guess the best bet would we currently do is you use associations, right? You use the groups of stars together to get an age and then a mass and a temperature. Um but metal cities yeah, that's must be really hard.",

It seems to be completely ubiquitous that every disc is just like full of structure. But then I think there's more complexities to that. And like I've been really interested in, you know, differences between like A type stars and later type stars because the A type stars are where we find all these giant directly image planets and they seem to have some slightly different disc properties like they hang on to gas for a lot longer and they have more massive discs and it seems like they might even have like different collisional properties and size distributions of bodies in their discs and so, you know, like the reach there would be to say, you know, I bet you could try and say something about like planet formation efficiency around different spectral type stars, you know, based on a variety of properties and my instinct is that there should be something there, but that we haven't gotten there yet.",

Go to kinematics and ask yourself, okay, what is the kinematics of stars that have these discs and you say the inner galaxy versus the outer galaxy. As we know there's a metal gradient in the disc. So if you look at the inner galaxy versus the outer galaxy, do you see anything um that happens to discs? That might be really difficult to do because I'm I'm guessing that these are all very local, my guess. Um, but but I think it would be I would start looking at spatial position and kinematics rather than trying to go down the metal.",
