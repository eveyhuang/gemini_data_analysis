And so the atmosphere is actually much better deterrent for high energy radiation getting to the ground as long as you don't destroy it, right? And as long as you have enough mass for the planet to hold an atmosphere. I don't know, Katherine, from solar system, I think you basically when you think about things around Jupiter, the problem we have is that they don't have enough atmosphere, but Titan worked, right? So Titan should be pretty sheltered on the surface, correct.",
