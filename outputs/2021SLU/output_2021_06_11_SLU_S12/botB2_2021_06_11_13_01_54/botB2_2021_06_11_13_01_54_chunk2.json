Uh, we we find a lot of planets around evolved stars. And I wonder whether in in our group there's there's a mix between I mean, I'm sure this has been done, but basically calculations as to what happens to the solar system as the sun evolves and how that will actually precisely affect habitability in our solar system. Like I said, I'm sure this has sort of been done before, but I have no clue how in to what detail.",

Um, and this is sort of analogous to the Jupiter system which I work on where you have IO, it's putting out all this material because Jupiter's magnetic field is so strong that material is lost from IO's atmosphere. So it sort of makes IO's habitability worse, but then the material gets spread throughout the entire system deposited on the other moons and this this transport of material via magnetic field happens in all four of the giant planet systems. Um, and that material for example on the surface of Europa then um you get these like radiolytically produced oxidants that are thought to to then diffuse through the ice shell and be potential nutrients for life. And so the this transport of material from another planet in the system combined with the stellar magnetic field has the potential to alter the conditions on the surface of one of the other planets and affect its habitability.",
