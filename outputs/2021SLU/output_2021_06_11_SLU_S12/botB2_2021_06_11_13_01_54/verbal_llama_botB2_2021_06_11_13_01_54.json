So it sort of makes IO's habitability worse, but then the material gets spread throughout the entire system deposited on the other moons and this this transport of material via magnetic field happens in all four of the giant planet systems. Um, and that material for example on the surface of Europa then um you get these like radiolytically produced oxidants that are thought to to then diffuse through the ice shell and be potential nutrients for life.

On the earth, we have life down to kilometers. So sterilizing the earth is actually not you would have to melt it down to a couple of kilometers to sterilize the earth. Sterilizing the surface of the earth is doable, but sterilizing the earth is not doable very easily. And so you need a huge impact to be able to do that. So that's good news for life. But when we have this discussion, I think just one thing to throw in, it's perfectly fine to say, you know, you can sterilize a planet as long as when we're reporting out or when we think about it is when we talk about radiation, we talk about the surface. And so if we're in the ocean or if we subsurface, that will be a completely different story. And so these paths of lives could diverge and you could think about when you talk about the galactic habitable zone, you can think about it as a part where we can remotely detect life because it made it to the surface and thus actually change the atmosphere considerably or if it never made it to the surface, does it still change the atmosphere the surface so we can see it, right? And so but I wanted to just bring this in because a lot of times the conversation will be different. And so um but I think this idea is about uh all these different parts together. It sounds sounds great. So I will throw it to the one non astronomer to get us started on this. So Bradford, you saw that coming, right?

Um, there's some ideas about um as there's like a couple papers saying that really massive super earth planets if they have stagnant lids might not have volcanism at all because any melt you'd form would form at such high pressure because it's beneath this thick stagnant lid and it's a high gravity planet so the pressure gradient's really high so then the forming really high pressure there's a pressure crossover where melt is actually denser than solid and it wouldn't rise up and erupt anymore. But I also think that result's kind of like really heavily model and parameter dependent and so I wouldn't necessarily take that as like a really general, you know, big super earth planets are always going to have trouble outgassing. So yeah, I mean I would generally expect like most I would expect your typical rocky planet to have volcanism at least at some point in its history. Um, it might die out really on if it doesn't have a lot of heat producing elements and if it has a stagnant lid, but there's probably going to be at least some volcanism.
