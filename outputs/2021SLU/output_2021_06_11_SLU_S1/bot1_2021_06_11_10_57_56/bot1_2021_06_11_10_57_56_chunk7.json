Um, but we might be able to get at the with sort of dis averaged albedo as a function of time. And and also variations in longitudinal albedo as a function of time because, you know, some component if there is an obliquity shift and if we can pull that out in some of the mapping techniques say that we could potentially pull out obliquity. Um, then we would know that, you know, some component of the longitude is at, you know, different different latitudes. So maybe that is gettable at, but I I don't know if anybody's actually looked into that. I know we we could talk to Nick. I know Nick and um Joel uh Schwartz, I think, were working on how much information we could pull out of these sorts of things, but but that's another potential, you know, I think project is to, you know, how how well could we pull out those sorts of static latitudinal changes that are due to seasonal variations and say vegetation or some other mechanism.",

I guess that's a that's a non answer. So that doesn't necessarily mean that can't be one of our one of our points that um that that and I and you know, from an hour we we couldn't have expected to have like the obvious path forward from it.
