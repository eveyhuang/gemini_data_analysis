I think Richard did a nice job yesterday about emphasizing, you know, the freedom to say anything, you know, um and you know, having a tone of inclusivity. So don't feel intimidated to make any comment. Please everybody feel that you can contribute. Um, the next thing that that we might do is to look for a volunteer for a reporter and uh recorder. So is anybody feeling up to that today?",
