How can you generalize it?",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I mean so so for instance, um I mean photosynthesis is a really it's a growing and emerging understanding of how it does this. But um basically there are molecular mechanisms that can, you know, get rid of excess light. So the the plant basically changes some confirmations of proteins and pushes things around so that we it doesn't get scorched. So so if it's too bright, it can actually down regulate and it emits that light or or or finds other ways to remove that that energy. And so it's a very active mechanism, right? It's it's a mechanism that is not just driven by chemical gradients or energetic gradients like you would expect through chemical processes, it's basically an active feedback mechanism. So, you know, you can I I in my head I would delineate that, you know, rocks and and maybe geological motion, things that are really moving, they're kind of driven by some basic kinetics. There's no system that says, oh wait, if the if if this happens then feed back and do something differently. You know, naturally we sometimes see that, but it's pretty rare. And so I would say that one it's it's really an idea. I don't know if this is true, but you could argue that things that develop a feedback mechanism could in principle be classified as differently than things that don't develop feedback mechanisms in their processes, right? And so photosynthesis is one example, but many of the things, right? We, you know, genetics evolving life tends to regulate their the DNA so that the you know when you create the next uh generation, you have some level of repeating structure that's that's very precisely regulated in a lot of ways.",

In that case, I think what you would be looking for in the in the best case scenario um is is something like seasonality is is an interesting one to think about. I mean obviously if you think of what is what right now just stay staying on earth for a minute, what is the what is a a signal of of life regulating the seasonal CO2 signal is is something that is entirely the result of of terrestrial of, you know, of of photosynthesis of of um the carbon and oxygen cycle. But the what I was saying more from the other way to think about broader questions of just of stability and regulation, you can pose questions looking at Earth's record. So is when we had when we had oxygenic photosynthesis, does this lead does this lead to greater stability in the oxygen cycle? You can test models from the rock record that say that once you have oxygenic photosynthesis, it's irreversible oxygenation is irreversible or not. And there there are still wildly different views on that whether life stabilizes or destabilizes a planet.",
