Um, there was there's portions when our biosphere was not as as didn't have as large of a scope as it is today and you know, it probably wasn't as dramatically shaping shaping the the atmosphere. So I guess and Tyler, you know, something that you your work has has, you know, directly thought about before. So it I guess it depends what you mean by by eking, eking by. If we had if we had primary productivity that was that was 15% of of what it was today, is that a biosphere that's eking by?

So I you know, one of the things that I I think we often do in mission design and people can tell me if I'm wrong is we silo ourselves, right? In terms of wavelength coverage, etc. And what what if we sort of backed off of that and thought about, well, what if I had not just a mission for biosignature detection, but missions that provided the necessary context. And that's where I kind of I'm interested in thinking about. I'm really interested in the like life just barely eking by what, you know, would we miss it or would we see it? I think that's an excellent question that I'm interested in. Um, but also just thinking about, you know, if motivating a lot of different contextual information that's not just from one mission and how could we get there and how would that increase our chance for finding life.",

I so so we had this I had a little discussion yesterday that it was just like what Nicole suggested I think where um if you step back from the context of of exoplanet science for a second, right now there's a lot of effort in putting people in space again, right? Getting them to the moon and potentially getting them to Mars. And it really makes me wonder if you could piggy back on these missions to basically build instruments that were had a much quicker turnaround, were not nearly as capable as these big missions, but when combined, you could perhaps do something like interferometrically that would allow you to observe in a very different way. So I I actually as an outsider, I was wondering, you know, given the current emphasis in getting people on the moon again, you could imagine instrumentation on the moon that is basically doing some sort of combined effort astronomy where it's not so focused and siloed. Um, I don't know if that's feasible from, you know, the perspective of your funding and how that would ever happen, but it seems like an opportunity, right? There's this kind of effort for commercialization of space travel. So maybe you could take advantage of that in the short term.",

I think I want to touch on a few things that Nathan brought up a while ago, you know, I think there's certainly feedbacks that are unique to biological processes, but you know, the like like Noah was saying that carbonate silicate feedback, what I think biology really does is just speed up the rate at which that might take place. So, um, to me as someone who doesn't know much about the technological capabilities, like I think there's two for me like what I see are the ways in which maybe life can impart the signature would either be like a temporal, you know, some sort of like rate change that might be noticeable or you know, better spatial resolution where you might be able to see spatial gradients on a planet, maybe that might reflect life versus biogenic biogenic versus abiotic processes. So I think to me that's what I was wondering about is if if either of those are in the in the future of our of our technological advances, maybe that would be one way to to think more about like the spatial or time gradients that life can impart.",

So I mean that that might be difficult.",
