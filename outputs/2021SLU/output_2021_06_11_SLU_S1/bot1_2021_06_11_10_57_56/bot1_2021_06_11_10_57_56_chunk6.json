I mean for the spatial one of the obvious ones if you look at a biogenic methane fluxes. They can be they're going to be entire they're the flux from from a protite is going to be dramatically different than the flux from any other any other material. So that's something that if you have tectonics on a planet and can chop things up into smaller blocks and have variations in spreading rates etcetera, you can you can have dramatically different amounts of you know, you can have patches of of the mantle that come to the surface or not and that will entirely dictate the spatial distribution and the overall magnitude of your methane flux from in an a biogenic planet.",

Um, the the the pigments, um, you know, I mean, we're talking about and Nikki knows this, um, well is um, we're looking, you know, the the the most observable consequences of the pigments are the edges, are the spectral edges where you have, for example, the vegetation red edge, you have the the contrast between, you know, the red 700 nanometer wavelengths and then the the very near infrared wavelengths where where vegetation or other photosynthesizers become very um reflective and that may be different depending on where the absorption peaks are. But you need the contrast, so you need part of the organism to be bright, um, not just part of it to be absorptive. And that's why, you know, thinking about pigments in water, um, water's very dark, um, and so they need to be near the surface to create the reflectance. So really what you're looking for are the spectral breaks and then the question becomes are those spectral breaks indicative of biology or are they from some mineral um that also has band gaps and and spectral breaks. And of course, we have libraries of those. So we'd have some kind of matching way of doing that. And I think Nikki probably has some thoughts about um, you know, um, you know, the the kind of ecological case of looking for multiple spectral breaks that may then um, you know, indicate multiple photosynthesizers in different environments. But certainly if you could then map those pigments to say uh on based on longitude and they were say collocated with where you're seeing the continents or collocated where you're seeing the continental margins, maybe that, you know, is a really strong biosignature.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I mean this is more a question than anything maybe useful. Um, you know, like if I think about the Earth's atmosphere, uh, it's in some places opaque, you know, like you have this, I think astronomers call it the 4,000 angstrom edge or line. Um, you know, plants tend to be reflective in those windows where the atmosphere is absorptive. So is there a way to kind of combine that information also as Eddie said kind of spatially, but you know, normally you these two things kind of uh anti correlate. So if you know the atmosphere and you say it's basically has some transmission windows here, here, here and here, then you might look for high reflectivity in those windows and that might suggest that things have basically adapted to to grow inside those windows, right? So if you are able to delineate those, that would be a really powerful tool, but I don't know if observationally you can do that because you're just looking at light coming back, you know, you don't you don't know whether it's transmission or or reflection or maybe you do.",

            "transcript": "So I don't I don't want to jump in here too much because the conversation is supposed to be amongst you guys, but just a note on that. We were talking about it in the gather session last night. Um yes, chlorophyll A has been demonstrated to absorb in an atmospheric window and it's, you know, where the maximum photon flux is from our star at the surface of the planet. But that actually doesn't hold up for bacteriochlorophylls. Some of them sit right under underwater bands. So as a general rule, that that may or may not really apply um to exoplanets. And so, and I think that you even brought it up earlier, the thing to keep in mind with phototrophic organisms is that um sometimes they're choking on the light. They get too much light and they can be actually photoinhibited.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, okay. So so I mean I guess I have a follow up question then because um uh, you know, like our atmosphere, right? It it tends to not transmit really at all in the UV and also like far mid infrared, right? It's kind of you have this kind of visible to near infrared kind of opening and there's obviously some change, you know, there's different things across there. But could you argue that all of photosynthesis that we know of lies within that basically visible to near infrared, right? So so at least on a broad scale, maybe not, you know, there's obviously subtle details and there's like some complications, but if you, you know, if you just look at it at a broad scale, you would say I I think that that it it it reason what it does is I I guess I I I am in my head correlating, you know, I have a black body spectrum from the sun.",
