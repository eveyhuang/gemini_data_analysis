Um it's still hard to hard to find, but it's it's something that you you technically have the hope of of seeing versus something that is completely invisible forever. Um",

Right now I think one of the things as as that our community uh has has done a bad job of is is talking about air meaningfully. So in the case of of methane like how you know, super fun idea to think about obviously you know, we've chatted about it something that is is could could spend an evening drinking and talking about, but how would we how would we actually define meaningful air on that I think is is kind of the next step for for for moving forward in in that.",

Um and then we see how well that could do at at finding life on a variety of I don't know, made up exoplanets. Um but given how ignorant we are of what exobiology might actually be like, um I'm I'm worried that we have blinders on um about what kind of signatures we could be missing, what kind of world that we could be missing by um sometimes locking ourselves into uh a perception for for what the next capabilities might be. And so I think that's the exact same statement as I'm I'm worried that we're throwing away interesting needles or missing key needles um when when we design when we continue to design our search for needles in the haystack.",

Um and so did we lock ourselves into a resolution that may be needed to be finer for some reason because of some other important biosphere that we might want to detect some other important feature that we might want to detect. Um and I I think the answer is we don't know and I'm I'm happy with the design of those missions and I and I do think they have very broad spectral coverage across the UV through the near infrared so that that helps mitigate against some of my concerns. Um but you can kind of see how the thinking creeps in and and then you see how you might be throwing away some interesting or important cases that you couldn't detect with what you design to go after the oxygen A band.",
