And so I imagine Earth as like a different planet every time you look at it throughout its history because a lot of things have changed. And so I think we have all these ideas of what bio signatures are for Earth today, but we know that life was on Earth for at least three and a half billion years or so. And so from a bio signatures perspective, if you applied all these techniques to Earth, at what point in Earth's history would you detect life for real with each of these techniques and those might all change things like the atmospheric detections of oxygen or the isotopes or the organic molecules in samples. And so it's a lot of times an origin of life there's this idea that once you have the tipping from the prebiotic world to the biotic world it just takes over and spreads rapidly because it's so good at evolution. And so that may or may not be true, but if it is, then even so you'd have this prebiotic or this completely biotic world for some time before things like atmospheric oxygen would even manifest. ",

But um basically there are molecular mechanisms that can, you know, get rid of excess light. So the the plant basically changes some confirmations of proteins and pushes things around so that we it doesn't get scorched. So so if it's too bright, it can actually down regulate and it emits that light or or or finds other ways to remove that that energy. And so it's a very active mechanism, right? It's it's a mechanism that is not just driven by chemical gradients or energetic gradients like you would expect through chemical processes, it's basically an active feedback mechanism. So, you know, you can I I in my head I would delineate that, you know, rocks and and maybe geological motion, things that are really moving, they're kind of driven by some basic kinetics. There's no system that says, oh wait, if the if if this happens then feed back and do something differently. You know, naturally we sometimes see that, but it's pretty rare. And so I would say that one it's it's really an idea. I don't know if this is true, but you could argue that things that develop a feedback mechanism could in principle be classified as differently than things that don't develop feedback mechanisms in their processes, right? And so photosynthesis is one example, but many of the things, right?

So is when we had when we had oxygenic photosynthesis, does this lead does this lead to greater stability in the oxygen cycle?

But you need the contrast, so you need part of the organism to be bright, um, not just part of it to be absorptive. And that's why, you know, thinking about pigments in water, um, water's very dark, um, and so they need to be near the surface to create the reflectance. So really what you're looking for are the spectral breaks and then the question becomes are those spectral breaks indicative of biology or are they from some mineral um that also has band gaps and and spectral breaks. And of course, we have libraries of those. So we'd have some kind of matching way of doing that. And I think Nikki probably has some thoughts about um, you know, um, you know, the the kind of ecological case of looking for multiple spectral breaks that may then um, you know, indicate multiple photosynthesizers in different environments. But certainly if you could then map those pigments to say uh on based on longitude and they were say collocated with where you're seeing the continents or collocated where you're seeing the continental margins, maybe that, you know, is a really strong biosignature.

Um, you know, plants tend to be reflective in those windows where the atmosphere is absorptive.

So if you know the atmosphere and you say it's basically has some transmission windows here, here, here and here, then you might look for high reflectivity in those windows and that might suggest that things have basically adapted to to grow inside those windows, right? So if you are able to delineate those, that would be a really powerful tool, but I don't know if observationally you can do that because you're just looking at light coming back, you know, you don't you don't know whether it's transmission or or reflection or maybe you do.
