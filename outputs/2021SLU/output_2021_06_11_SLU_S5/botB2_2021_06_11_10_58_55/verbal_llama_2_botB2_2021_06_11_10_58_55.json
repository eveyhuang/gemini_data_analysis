And so I'm almost and yeah, like I I can I can almost imagine something similar but like just on like a chemical level where you you dope in like different you know organics that are isotopically enriched and then do like model prebiotic reactions or things like that and actually see kind of where they end up.

I mean one of the things um someone joining my group soon looks at two sulfur bearing amino acids because I'm a sulfur fan, you know, and using one of those might be directly biosynthesized depending on your organism. One of them might be taken up from food and actually the offset in sulfur isotopes between those two can tell you something.

To to sort of think about that in in a little bit of a negative context. And it brings me back to a word that Amanda used earlier which is pattern. So in all kinds of different areas that people think about signatures of life, I think things are trending in the direction of you know, what what are the patterns that are really characteristic. And um, so I wanted to maybe try to pivot a little bit and and think in for example an exoplanet frame of reference or something along those lines. Um, uh, you know, what kinds of patterns can what what are the equivalents that we can think about in planetary atmospheres for example?

Well, there are small reactive organic compounds in the absence of of life would just degrade very quickly.

If if there's a large number of states of possibility for abiotic worlds and that that inhabited worlds settle on a small subset of those and strongly represent them and so um I think that would be a really cool already I can see several places where there's strong potential for cross pollination between the way that these different communities approach this problem.
