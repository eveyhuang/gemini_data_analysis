Like um when like can you get like isotopic information from that? Like so for example like when I'm looking at uh a peptide and if I take an infrared spectrum of it just in the lab, there are certain vibrations that are more you know like they're like more like location specific, right? So like for example if there was a deuterium there instead of a hydrogen in a spot, I could see that certain bands would shift where other ones would not, right? Like can like are like do you can you actually get data like that? like spectroscopically? I'm not I just don't know. Yeah.",

Um but it was what Natasha was saying that you're still the the signal like you don't you don't get this like exquisite beautiful spectrum where you can just see all the lines, you get something that's like stuck in the noise underneath the fact that what you're primarily seeing is the star. Um and so you make a template spectrum that has you know that that has like the various isotopologues that you think might be present and you cross correlate against the noise and by leveraging the the the power of the entire broad spectrum, you get out a signal, you get out you know there's there's there's a match and there's a better match with one with one template than another. So it it is it is possible. I'm I'm on a paper right now that has that that potentially has a um a isotope measurement in a but in like a hot Jupiter atmosphere um and it's the easy it's it's like it's CO, it's like the easiest molecule to go after.",

So if you're making isotope measurements of hot Jupiters where we're like not very optimistic of habitability, could you compare across you know, places that have potential for habitability versus compared to those that don't um from this suite of ice like potential, you know, if we can only do CO and CO2 and you know, maybe methane if we're dreaming, you know, the comparative exoplanetology through a potentially habitable window or in combination with water or something.

She was supposed to be in this group and I just wanted to point out on a different side. She has her she's on a really recent and very interesting paper that was something we had talked about earlier thinking about how we can use organic molecules and their complexity. And this is more of like a sample return question. I didn't want to derail it, but thinking about just the intrinsic complexity of molecules themselves and essentially it's saying like just if we strip away everything we know about enzymes and process and all of that useful stuff and just say how big and how rare should these things be if they're truly randomly being produced due to catalysis on surfaces and stuff. And I thought that was a really fascinating idea just to say assuming we know nothing about biology, can we still learn something just from statistical complexity? In other words, we have a whole lot of this one molecule and it's really big and it's really unusual, is that in and of itself sort of a sign of biogenicity or at least uh focused catalysis, I guess maybe would be the most broad reading. But I just wanted to bring it up because I she's not here right now, but that's I found that really interesting.",

And it goes back to this discussion of pathways that that Andrew and a few other people have brought up earlier on is that one of the characteristics I think of life is that um it down selects from a very large set of possibilities and settles on pathways that give you specific things, right? And and so that's the the you know, the principle that underlies some of the patterns that we look for in for example organic molecules and that kind of thing. I wonder if that principle is transposable into the question of of exoplanet atmospheres, right? If if there's a large number of states of possibility for abiotic worlds and that that inhabited worlds settle on a small subset of those and strongly represent them and so um I think that would be a really cool already I can see several places where there's strong potential for cross pollination between the way that these different communities approach this problem. Um and I wonder if that kind of thing, you know, thinking in less in specific terms, can you detect these molecules and more in terms of what are the underlying principles? What what's the reason for wanting to detect them in the first place and can I think about those principles in a different observing reference frame, right? One that is tractable and so um just curious.",
