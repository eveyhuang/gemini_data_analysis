And um, I think that's I think that's super interesting, but I think it's really hard and um, you know, I'm just uh like for example, when people are looking at a lot of um small metabolites and biological systems,",

            "transcript": "Right? It it one of the hardest parts of those studies is like they get all they get tons of this data and they can do all this networking and um really cool analyses, but is actually figuring out exactly what the molecules are, right? You know, a lot of times they have to purchase the standards and run the standards and compare them to the, you know, and and that that's really the most time consuming part a lot of times of those analyses. And so I I I think this is I think this is a really this is a really tough problem. I mean, and and you know, like when we think about going from, oh, I want to look at this molecule and this molecule and this molecule to all these molecules and how they interact with one another, um, you know, like scaling that or like or or doing that kind of work on a on a rover or something is is a real challenge. Um, which is why I think I I'm obviously I'm really excited about a lot of the new experiments that are going on on the rovers, but I'm also excited about a lot of the sample return projects that are going on now because I think that the kinds of experiments we can do if we get sample back is I mean, orders of magnitude like deeper than what we can probably do elsewhere and again, it's not that that it's not that those experiments aren't useful, they're extremely useful, but I guess from my standpoint, I I like I'm I'm interested kind of more in the organic stuff too like like Ming was saying and so um I think it I think it'll be really difficult to assign like assign like when you have these really complex mixtures like assign everything and really kind of like make sense of the mess, right? And so um I don't really know where I'm going with this to be honest with you. Um I just I think I think analytically I think this is a really this is a really hard problem.",

            "transcript": "No no worries, Jay, I actually have a follow up with that um to to expand with that to everybody else as well is that you know, Tori asked about well what's the importance of amino acids? Because you're right, you really can't tell if it's, you know, biolic or abiotic. But there are other small organic molecules like how oxygen is, it's a it's a reactive gas. Well, there are small reactive organic compounds in the absence of of life would just degrade very quickly. And if you see them in an environment and I'm thinking I mean something I'm near and dear to oxyl acetic acid, the heart of citric acid cycle compounds, these these molecules are ridiculously reactive. And yet if you see them in an in a different environment outside of biology, that would be very exciting both for an organic chemist and it's more indication of how the heck is this molecule persisting is that life? So that in that case it's it's something where the identification of of one single molecule and organic compound could in fact bring more interest to that environment. So so there are some that are in fact very intriguing and perhaps if an astronomer said, listen, I see this this this gaseous just a keto acid or something in in the atmosphere, wow, that would excite us. Anyway, so just to help you out, I'm also interested in that as well and um, you know, looking at discrete organics but ones that may be a little bit more um uh, you know, telling of of a biotic system that shouldn't be there. So that's all.",
