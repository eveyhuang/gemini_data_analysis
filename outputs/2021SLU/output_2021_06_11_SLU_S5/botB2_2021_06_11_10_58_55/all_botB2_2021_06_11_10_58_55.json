The other one was was, you know, it wasn't the distinction wasn't just made between living and non-living systems, but rather between prebiotic systems, um, living systems and dead systems. And so thinking of all of those as representing something like a continuum maybe in in the way that systems structure themselves in in chemical and other terms, I thought was interesting and so, so to extend the discussion in those directions also, um, might be kind of useful. But um, but I wanted to ask, does does anyone want to kind of dig into this discussion and and I'll ask that um, because I can't see quite everyone on my screen, um, please just jump in whenever you feel it's appropriate.

And if you think about the the trajectory of an emerging prebiotic system towards something that's truly biological, one of the things that probably has to be developing is catalytic capability and specificity. And so to me, you know, it it goes to this bigger question of how do you distinguish what's alive and what's what's on a trajectory to be alive when it's, you know, when the one that's on the trajectory is beginning to acquire some of the characteristics of what you perceive as life, but maybe not the full set. And and so um Amanda, I think you you put your finger on something important um and Morgan as well in that maybe maybe it is stacking up orthogonal um uh ways of looking at the system uh so so that you're seeing it from several different perspectives or several different facets and I I wonder what you all think about that notion.",

I think one of I really love thinking about this from a meteorite perspective because that's a very different piece than I've usually thought about with amino acids. But certainly when we're talking about something that we think of as so ubiquitous like amino acids in the biosphere, like the biosphere is almost a little too clever sometimes and the the amount of recycling and reutilization and direct uptake as opposed to direct biosynthesis is huge of course on the modern biosphere and maybe if these really are ubiquitous, something we would expect to see all over the place is really creative utilization and reutilization of amino acids. I mean one of the things um someone joining my group soon looks at two sulfur bearing amino acids because I'm a sulfur fan, you know, and using one of those might be directly biosynthesized depending on your organism. One of them might be taken up from food and actually the offset in sulfur isotopes between those two can tell you something.

To to sort of think about that in in a little bit of a negative context. And it brings me back to a word that Amanda used earlier which is pattern. So in all kinds of different areas that people think about signatures of life, I think things are trending in the direction of you know, what what are the patterns that are really characteristic. And um, so I wanted to maybe try to pivot a little bit and and think in for example an exoplanet frame of reference or something along those lines. Um, uh, you know, what kinds of patterns can what what are the equivalents that we can think about in planetary atmospheres for example? And I wonder if this will take us a little bit in the direction that Liz mentioned of of thinking about systems in terms of their, you know, their entropy or their energy or you know, or patterns and those things.

We uh we might be able to measure isotopic ratios in atmospheres um in the not so distant future if there are any um if if if we expect any impacts on the on the global atmosphere from uh from biology. But um yeah, no, I mean we're really I I I'm we're really thinking on the astronomy side I think as well in terms of patterns. Um, you know, on a global scale, you detect you detect a gas, you detect a couple of gases um on an individual planet that that that still is probably not the smoking gun. I mean similar to to what you're all talking about with um with uh abiotic isotope isotopic fractionation that that that could be biological but but could also uh be abiotic. It's the same problem on a on any individual planet. Um, so um, uh yeah, we're thinking about about trends over many objects. Um, what would be what what what would be the smoking gun of of life if you could if you could see a particular trend in many planets.

So, um, so that can maybe limit the, you know, the complexity of the the compound pools, right? Comparing to the abiotic reactions that can form like hundreds of compounds from one single molecule. So in that regards, uh, I think the pattern is important. Maybe you can see some trends uh as we observe on earth, we can maybe simulate some experiments, um, you know, both abiotically and biologically and to see uh what could be um produced from a known, you know, carbon pool.

Um, which is why I think I I'm obviously I'm really excited about a lot of the new experiments that are going on on the rovers, but I'm also excited about a lot of the sample return projects that are going on now because I think that the kinds of experiments we can do if we get sample back is I mean, orders of magnitude like deeper than what we can probably do elsewhere and again, it's not that that it's not that those experiments aren't useful, they're extremely useful, but I guess from my standpoint, I I like I'm I'm interested kind of more in the organic stuff too like like Ming was saying and so um I think it I think it'll be really difficult to assign like assign like when you have these really complex mixtures like assign everything and really kind of like make sense of the mess, right? And so um I don't really know where I'm going with this to be honest with you. Um I just I think I think analytically I think this is a really this is a really hard problem.",

Because you're right, you really can't tell if it's, you know, biolic or abiotic. But there are other small organic molecules like how oxygen is, it's a it's a reactive gas. Well, there are small reactive organic compounds in the absence of of life would just degrade very quickly. And if you see them in an environment and I'm thinking I mean something I'm near and dear to oxyl acetic acid, the heart of citric acid cycle compounds, these these molecules are ridiculously reactive. And yet if you see them in an in a different environment outside of biology, that would be very exciting both for an organic chemist and it's more indication of how the heck is this molecule persisting is that life? So that in that case it's it's something where the identification of of one single molecule and organic compound could in fact bring more interest to that environment. So so there are some that are in fact very intriguing and perhaps if an astronomer said, listen, I see this this this gaseous just a keto acid or something in in the atmosphere, wow, that would excite us. Anyway, so just to help you out, I'm also interested in that as well and um, you know, looking at discrete organics but ones that may be a little bit more um uh, you know, telling of of a biotic system that shouldn't be there.

She has her she's on a really recent and very interesting paper that was something we had talked about earlier thinking about how we can use organic molecules and their complexity. And this is more of like a sample return question. I didn't want to derail it, but thinking about just the intrinsic complexity of molecules themselves and essentially it's saying like just if we strip away everything we know about enzymes and process and all of that useful stuff and just say how big and how rare should these things be if they're truly randomly being produced due to catalysis on surfaces and stuff. And I thought that was a really fascinating idea just to say assuming we know nothing about biology, can we still learn something just from statistical complexity? In other words, we have a whole lot of this one molecule and it's really big and it's really unusual, is that in and of itself sort of a sign of biogenicity or at least uh focused catalysis, I guess maybe would be the most broad reading. But I just wanted to bring it up because I she's not here right now, but that's I found that really interesting.",

And it goes back to this discussion of pathways that that Andrew and a few other people have brought up earlier on is that one of the characteristics I think of life is that um it down selects from a very large set of possibilities and settles on pathways that give you specific things, right? And and so that's the the you know, the principle that underlies some of the patterns that we look for in for example organic molecules and that kind of thing. I wonder if that principle is transposable into the question of of exoplanet atmospheres, right? If if there's a large number of states of possibility for abiotic worlds and that that inhabited worlds settle on a small subset of those and strongly represent them and so um I think that would be a really cool already I can see several places where there's strong potential for cross pollination between the way that these different communities approach this problem. Um and I wonder if that kind of thing, you know, thinking in less in specific terms, can you detect these molecules and more in terms of what are the underlying principles? What what's the reason for wanting to detect them in the first place and can I think about those principles in a different observing reference frame, right?
