   "transcript": "years old. I feel like one of the places that I'm excited about on this topic is thinking about like suites of isotope signatures rather than absolute values, but um, of multiple phases have some chance to have not just absolute value, but differences among phases. I you know, all that. I think there's I think maybe minor isotopes fall in that category too. Um, but if there's additional dimensions of information, that seems to be a place to make some progress.",

Uh, like where is the placement of the isotopic enrichment within the molecule? Um, is that something that you guys very much consider?",

   "transcript": "I think some of that to me just to try to carry this forward gets gets to is is kind of emblematic of a of a bigger issue, right? Which is if you think about isotopes and what causes kinetic isotope fractionation, right? It's it's the specificity of the enzymes and and the catalytic impact of the enzymes. And if you think about the the trajectory of an emerging prebiotic system towards something that's truly biological, one of the things that probably has to be developing is catalytic capability and specificity. And so to me, you know, it it goes to this bigger question of how do you distinguish what's alive and what's what's on a trajectory to be alive when it's, you know, when the one that's on the trajectory is beginning to acquire some of the characteristics of what you perceive as life, but maybe not the full set. And and so um Amanda, I think you you put your finger on something important um and Morgan as well in that maybe maybe it is stacking up orthogonal um uh ways of looking at the system uh so so that you're seeing it from several different perspectives or several different facets and I I wonder what you all think about that notion.",

   "transcript": "I like this and um it's kind of come back to what Andrew was saying. Um, so basically isotopic enrichment of lighter species comes from the kinetics of life needing to be able to put things on and pull things off. So we would expect to see more enrichment of lighter isotopes as those precursor molecules get developed into the the longer ones if it's biological. Is that correct? And we would expect more enrichment of heavier isotopes if it's more of a thermodynamic process with radical chemistry. Is that am I delineating this correctly?",

And so if it is a and it does it doesn't have to be necessarily a keto acid in another environment, but there's going to be one particular precursor and so you could target that and say, listen, do you see that same that same signature of of isotopes because the whole molecule is not going to be as we know destroyed and then put back together in another way.",
