And then we can start to correlate different formation environments with different um perhaps amino acid structures and where uh isotopic enrichment occurs and um perhaps just extensive enrichment if we can't find out where it was. So is that something that is actually feasible at this stage?",

I you know, I'm I'm thinking of in like in like biological proteomic experiments, there's a technique called Silac where like stable isotopes like labeling and cell culture or whatever. And so what they'll do is when they're growing cells, they'll have some of them where they feed them isotopically heavy amino acids in their diet, right? And so they can actually like they can like kind of split different cell populations and then do like relative abundances and comparisons. And so I'm almost and yeah, like I I can I can almost imagine something similar but like just on like a chemical level where you you dope in like different you know organics that are isotopically enriched and then do like model prebiotic reactions or things like that and actually see kind of where they end up. Um, and also you can almost like seed it into you know, if you have like different like populations of microbes or things like that and I don't know. Is is that kind of what you're talking about Amanda?",

Like basically mining the the meteoritic literature looking for what organic mole basically trying to do different correlation matrices between um different aspects of the meteorite like its history, extent of weathering, um um etc against um what uh organic molecules are found distributions or um total content, things like that. And what type of correlations could we then do between how biology has influenced uh some of these isotopic signatures or enrichment in amino acids here on earth and compare that then to the the different correlations that you see in in meteorites and then also in some of the prebiotic work if there's anything um that we could do with that, maybe we could start to find out what are those axes that give us um an actual bio signature versus um what are things that are kind of like a false positive.",

            "transcript": "I have a quick comment on this too. I think one of I really love thinking about this from a meteorite perspective because that's a very different piece than I've usually thought about with amino acids. But certainly when we're talking about something that we think of as so ubiquitous like amino acids in the biosphere, like the biosphere is almost a little too clever sometimes and the the amount of recycling and reutilization and direct uptake as opposed to direct biosynthesis is huge of course on the modern biosphere and maybe if these really are ubiquitous, something we would expect to see all over the place is really creative utilization and reutilization of amino acids. I mean one of the things um someone joining my group soon looks at two sulfur bearing amino acids because I'm a sulfur fan, you know, and using one of those might be directly biosynthesized depending on your organism. One of them might be taken up from food and actually the offset in sulfur isotopes between those two can tell you something. But depending on who you are, your pathway to getting at methionine can be very different.",

            "transcript": "So I'm going to suggest that um this is a really obvious bullet point for for our report out and probably an obvious thing to crystallize in any breakout discussion around because it sounds like there's some real traction in the topic. Um, just to pick up a thread that that you just mentioned Morgan, you know, maybe something like the extent of recycling of of resources is actually a characteristic of a biological system that doesn't exist in in abiotic systems, right? To to sort of think about that in in a little bit of a negative context. And it brings me back to a word that Amanda used earlier which is pattern. So in all kinds of different areas that people think about signatures of life, I think things are trending in the direction of you know, what what are the patterns that are really characteristic. And um, so I wanted to maybe try to pivot a little bit and and think in for example an exoplanet frame of reference or something along those lines. Um, uh, you know, what kinds of patterns can what what are the equivalents that we can think about in planetary atmospheres for example? And I wonder if this will take us a little bit in the direction that Liz mentioned of of thinking about systems in terms of their, you know, their entropy or their energy or you know, or patterns and those things. So um, for folks in that realm, um, where do your thoughts lie on this?",

            "transcript": "Um, I mean this is this is certainly it was the hook for for this session for for me was that was um observations of exoplanet atmospheres and how we how we might distinguish between living and non living from from remote sensing techniques. So I mean just I I I I know far less about about biology than than many of you. But um uh you know, things that we can things that we can observe are spectroscopically active gases. We uh we might be able to measure isotopic ratios in atmospheres um in the not so distant future if there are any um if if if we expect any impacts on the on the global atmosphere from uh from biology. But um yeah, no, I mean we're really I I I'm we're really thinking on the astronomy side I think as well in terms of patterns. Um, you know, on a global scale, you detect you detect a gas, you detect a couple of gases um on an individual planet that that that still is probably not the smoking gun. I mean similar to to what you're all talking about with um with uh abiotic isotope isotopic fractionation that that that could be biological but but could also uh be abiotic. It's the same problem on a on any individual planet. Um, so um, uh yeah, we're thinking about about trends over many objects. Um, what would be what what what would be the smoking gun of of life if you could if you could see a particular trend in many planets. I'd love to get feedback from from all of you because that's kind of again my knowledge of biology is is uh is very limited.",

So I you know, can we take this further? Um, I think even knowing, you know, whether we can do this, I think would be very valuable in my from my point of view.",

It's always a question of isotopic fractionation and differences between pools, right? Like there are fractionations when biology converts one thing to another thing. And so if you could measure two things that you were you expect had a relationship functionally, that could be a place to start and then we could have um sort of fundamental thermodynamic understanding about what we'd expect those ratios to be like originally and then um perhaps be able to see modifications.",
