And I think it pushes things necessarily in the direction of a more statistical perspective, right? Looking for patterns in patterns, uh, as an example and that kind of thing. Um, and I think that's something that is harder to get with in situ science because we we have, you know, on earth it's very hard to access an example of something that hasn't been impacted by biology or is filled with biology or has been cycled through biology or or so. And so, um, I I think that there is another potential for convergence between fields there in that regard, right? Think adopting some of the statistical perspective that has necessarily emerged in in the exoplanet field. Um, and I wonder if there are places that you can see that kind of perspective brought to bear in an in situ context, right? The cross pollination I think would be a really nice outcome of of what we can do in this in this discussion.",

But to follow on, I think one intriguing thing to me seems to be that, you know, what would be a bio signature uh, on earth has changed significantly over time and, you know, when we look at exoplanets, of course, we only get one snapshot in time, but maybe by putting that together as a large sample for different stellar ages, we can try to, you know, check or probe this evolution of life that we had on earth and the bio signatures that come with it, you know, and do a test statistical test sample case for exoplanets. So I I'm wondering if that may be another way we can connect um another way to or another way to distinguish and connect and test this ideas of, you know, emergence of life and the bio signatures that it leaves and that we could look for.",

I don't know, a methane rich atmosphere at the beginning and then, you know, it changes to an oxygen rich atmosphere of I don't know, after two giga years, just just as a default and then we can compare that with observations and see whether that's true or not true. It's, you know, it's it's not great, but I think it's like a zero order thing we could maybe try to quantify.",

Because the observables are are so different. And in the case of what you can observe in exoplanet science, I think, you know, the information content is really in the system, not in the individual molecules necessarily that you're looking at. And and so, you know, that's that's where you begin to see the patterns or, you know, or in observing multiples of those systems and in situ, we look at things often in a very different way where the information can be in an individual observation and and what what matters then is to think about how the, you know, various processes and time come to bear on that information content.",

You you are potentially looking at a very high information content that can be very descriptive of both origin of that material, but also all of the processing that it's undergone.

Can be abiotic, biological, you know, pathways. So if we only know that, you know, that compound is present, it's hard to tell is like uh formed by life or not. So I think that really opens the question. I think using isotope is definitely a a very, you know, maybe one of the best ways can tell, you know, the the origin of the compounds, the the signatures there. Um, but I think another thing I also agree very much is that, you know, for biology uh, you know, systems, they prefer to form some specific compounds, right? So, um, so that can maybe limit the, you know, the complexity of the the compound pools, right? Comparing to the abiotic reactions that can form like hundreds of compounds from one single molecule. So in that regards, uh, I think the pattern is important. Maybe you can see some trends uh as we observe on earth, we can maybe simulate some experiments, um, you know, both abiotically and biologically and to see uh what could be um produced from a known, you know, carbon pool.
