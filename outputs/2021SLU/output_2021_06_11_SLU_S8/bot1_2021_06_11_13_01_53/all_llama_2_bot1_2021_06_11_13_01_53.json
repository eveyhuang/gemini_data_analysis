Um, you know, and are there uh and and what time scales are necessary to observe a planet to kind of to do that. Uh, and then I just thought like oh you know this is the first prompt we've gotten uh where there was an easy question in the first part of it, right? Which is you know that the the the type of planet that's easy that's most likely to host detectable life is one that announces itself. Uh that we don't actually have to go looking for. Uh and that would be the ideal case. It makes all of our lives so much easier. Um, but that we we should be working down this spectrum of detectability from planets that scream we're inhabited to ones that through whatever development methods we have are are easy to tell are inhabited on some annual or interannual time scale uh to ones where the biosphere just doesn't modify the surface in any way that that our clever minds can come up with to tell.

Um and one, one thing to consider is like as we move towards the future and we're thinking about trying to directly image planets, at that point if you're getting a spectrum by getting the light from planet directly versus looking at the planet as it crosses in front of the star, then it becomes better if the planet is farther from the star because you have a a bigger separation and the starlight's less of an issue. Um and I think David Spiegel had a paper where they were looking at can you disentangle what what the atmosphere of the moon is from the atmosphere of the planet. So it might actually be if you have a case where you have something that is just such a classic gas giant that it has nothing in its atmosphere that could potentially be exciting for life and it happens to have a moon that looks just wonderful, maybe then you can disentangle the two and it might be easier than having an earth that's closer in if this moon is also heated by tidal effects, but I I think I I agree with Smadar that it's going to be a lot harder than just looking at a single planet because you're adding in a whole other layer of modeling complexity that you need to find the radii and the masses of two objects instead of just one. Really three because you need the properties of the star too. But it's worth considering.",

It has uh um so I I just learned it yesterday. So it has a molten core and it has a magnetic field that has um um it's big enough that people don't like it because it has very high pressured ice. Um but it has plate tectonics too. Um and I mean I wonder if we're I mean if we're pushing things from um maybe a the nominal approach to look for um for life. I wonder if when we're looking at our own solar system, if we want to try to find the best place that can hide life and try to find it there rather than uh find an active place and say maybe this active place has life in it. I don't know if I'm clear enough because I'm kind of combining all kind of things that had in my head. So.",

With different concentration distributions and also the energy differences, right? Between maybe the the depth of the ocean or, you know, there has to be some fluxes, has to be some, you know, mixing processes that might, you know, provide, you know, uh the crater for life, right? So, um so I just wonder if, you know, those things can be considered if you look for those habitable, you know, places, right? So how do we tell, you know, if like maybe um that planet is like inert, right? So there's no like obvious activity that you can see from Earth. Uh but maybe some others, you know, they have maybe some plumes, some, you know, maybe potential hydrothermal activities, that makes that moons or planets more, I think it's more interesting, right? So maybe that can um give like a higher, you know, consideration, maybe on the list, right? But it really depends on what are the uh the key points, right? The key parameters we're looking to, right? So, um I wonder if using our current technology, uh you know, like remote sensing, if we can tell those gradients, uh so maybe just from the surface, maybe not in the subsurface, maybe something is more interesting and current below the surface. So, I think uh that'll be better we know we have both information. So, yeah.",

But in fact in um after a star dies and you get a white dwarf, you get lots of little instabilities that you can have um planets that initially did not uh did not host um water or did not have enough uh the best condition to form uh to form life. Uh but you reseed them because this um process of becoming a white dwarf change the dynamics of the um of the system and we show that it can actually push a lot of little rocks and uh you know, from um from the um well, I need to back down back up for a second, sorry. There is a piece of information that I didn't say. Most stars like to live in binaries. It's the most important thing that I want to say. Um and and therefore, if I have a system where the stellar binary companion did not do much, you know, it was far away, didn't care for anything. Um and the system evolved as is, right? We can hide um we know that we don't have a companion, but we can hide a uh dark and dark star up to 1,000 AU and it will not affect at all our system.",

Um the point about whether we have energy gradients on planets and how we can look for those. So I added a note about surface variability, but I think I could rephrase that to be better. Um so just the the first point here was that I think the main thread through our conversation is that the most common types of life might not be the most detectable. Um the second point is that we know life is resilient, it exists in many environments, but not all. Thanks Joe, on earth. Um so how broad should we be when thinking about where life could exist elsewhere and what subset of that parameter space is also going to lead to life that's detectable.",

Even if you couldn't do that, if you could just measure, you know, trace gas compositions, you would see CO2 fluctuations, you you would see signals that would point you towards a biosphere that's responding to seasonal forcings.

Um and in in in about uh you know, 800 million years or so give or take 100 million years, uh the carbon silicate cycle will draw CO2 down to the point that um the the atmosphere uh may flip back to being very reducing as it was in the Arcaean.

Um, we covered everything, starting off from our really wonderful prompt, which touched on the idea that there are lots of things to consider when you look for habitable worlds, where should you look, what types of environments are habitable, and which of those environments are also detectable. Um and Chris just put the notes for our discussion in the chat if you want to read along. Uh the summary here is that the first point we discussed in great detail was that not all life might lead to detectable signatures and there's probably a spectrum of detectability. You might have some life that's just glaringly obvious, especially on the techno signature end of the spectrum and then other types of life that are a bit more subtle. At the very end of the discussion, we were discussing how if you had a planet where all the life is in the ocean, maybe you could even have different limits on the overall atmospheric composition for the planet than if you had surface life. You don't have to worry as much about fires perhaps in that case.",
