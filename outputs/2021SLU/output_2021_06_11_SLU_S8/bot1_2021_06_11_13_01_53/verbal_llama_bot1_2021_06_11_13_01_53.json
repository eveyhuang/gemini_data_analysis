Um and I think David Spiegel had a paper where they were looking at can you disentangle what what the atmosphere of the moon is from the atmosphere of the planet. So it might actually be if you have a case where you have something that is just such a classic gas giant that it has nothing in its atmosphere that could potentially be exciting for life and it happens to have a moon that looks just wonderful, maybe then you can disentangle the two and it might be easier than having an earth that's closer in if this moon is also heated by tidal effects, but I I think I I agree with Smadar that it's going to be a lot harder than just looking at a single planet because you're adding in a whole other layer of modeling complexity that you need to find the radii and the masses of two objects instead of just one.

So how do we tell, you know, if like maybe um that planet is like inert, right? So there's no like obvious activity that you can see from Earth. Uh but maybe some others, you know, they have maybe some plumes, some, you know, maybe potential hydrothermal activities, that makes that moons or planets more, I think it's more interesting, right?

Um, we covered everything, starting off from our really wonderful prompt, which touched on the idea that there are lots of things to consider when you look for habitable worlds, where should you look, what types of environments are habitable, and which of those environments are also detectable. Um and Chris just put the notes for our discussion in the chat if you want to read along. Uh the summary here is that the first point we discussed in great detail was that not all life might lead to detectable signatures and there's probably a spectrum of detectability. You might have some life that's just glaringly obvious, especially on the techno signature end of the spectrum and then other types of life that are a bit more subtle. At the very end of the discussion, we were discussing how if you had a planet where all the life is in the ocean, maybe you could even have different limits on the overall atmospheric composition for the planet than if you had surface life. You don't have to worry as much about fires perhaps in that case. ",
