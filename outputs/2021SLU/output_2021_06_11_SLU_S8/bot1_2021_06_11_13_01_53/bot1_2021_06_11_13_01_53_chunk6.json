Um, did you Smadar, did you also say because so there's one possibility is you have what's there and you you you know, you toast it but you don't toast it enough so that it loses all of its volatiles and maybe it, you know, creates some some other stuff, maybe it degasses a little bit and it gets maybe, you know, like a second, a second uh, a second cut. Um, but is it also I I feel like and I may have just been misunderstanding you but you it it seems like you were saying in some of the binary systems that you might bring can you bring enough material into actually form a new planet or are you just limited by what was there initially around the star that's already gone that's gone through the red giant phase.",

So you can have in fact, we see that there are like little pulses sometimes for for stars as they lose mass. And then what he showed is that you'll get um these rocky planets colliding together and create a new um asteroid belt. Um and then if you wait enough, um the thought was so this is now speculation beyond his paper that maybe they can combine together somehow and form a new um a new planet. But I think that if you have planets that survive and this is what I said that if you have planets that survive there and and even if they lost some of their uh water, you can deliver water from outside due to a companion far, far away. It doesn't even have to be a star, it can be just a brown dwarf or just a planet nine or whatever if you want to have a planet nine in your system.",

So I just dropped those in the chat and hopefully you can take a look and let me know if you think I've cut stuff. Um the what I think we're missing now it's more about the chemistry side of things. Um the point about whether we have energy gradients on planets and how we can look for those. So I added a note about surface variability, but I think I could rephrase that to be better. Um so just the the first point here was that I think the main thread through our conversation is that the most common types of life might not be the most detectable. Um the second point is that we know life is resilient, it exists in many environments, but not all. Thanks Joe, on earth. Um so how broad should we be when thinking about where life could exist elsewhere and what subset of that parameter space is also going to lead to life that's detectable.",
