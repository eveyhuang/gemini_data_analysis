Um and one, one thing to consider is like as we move towards the future and we're thinking about trying to directly image planets, at that point if you're getting a spectrum by getting the light from planet directly versus looking at the planet as it crosses in front of the star, then it becomes better if the planet is farther from the star because you have a a bigger separation and the starlight's less of an issue. Um and I think David Spiegel had a paper where they were looking at can you disentangle what what the atmosphere of the moon is from the atmosphere of the planet. So it might actually be if you have a case where you have something that is just such a classic gas giant that it has nothing in its atmosphere that could potentially be exciting for life and it happens to have a moon that looks just wonderful, maybe then you can disentangle the two and it might be easier than having an earth that's closer in if this moon is also heated by tidal effects, but I I think I I agree with Smadar that it's going to be a lot harder than just looking at a single planet because you're adding in a whole other layer of modeling complexity that you need to find the radii and the masses of two objects instead of just one. Really three because you need the properties of the star too. But it's worth considering.",

Um because it's defied that because it's been really hard to see anything but the ice shell. Uh and in that detectable part of the environment, it's not great for habitability.

It has uh um so I I just learned it yesterday. So it has a molten core and it has a magnetic field that has um um it's big enough that people don't like it because it has very high pressured ice. Um but it has plate tectonics too. Um and I mean I wonder if we're I mean if we're pushing things from um maybe a the nominal approach to look for um for life. I wonder if when we're looking at our own solar system, if we want to try to find the best place that can hide life and try to find it there rather than uh find an active place and say maybe this active place has life in it. I don't know if I'm clear enough because I'm kind of combining all kind of things that had in my head. So.",

Uh I think, you know, in habitable worlds, uh there needs to be uh like a gradient of uh, you know, uh chemistry gradients, right? With different concentration distributions and also the energy differences, right? Between maybe the the depth of the ocean or, you know, there has to be some fluxes, has to be some, you know, mixing processes that might, you know, provide, you know, uh the crater for life, right? So, um so I just wonder if, you know, those things can be considered if you look for those habitable, you know, places, right? So how do we tell, you know, if like maybe um that planet is like inert, right? So there's no like obvious activity that you can see from Earth. Uh but maybe some others, you know, they have maybe some plumes, some, you know, maybe potential hydrothermal activities, that makes that moons or planets more, I think it's more interesting, right? So maybe that can um give like a higher, you know, consideration, maybe on the list, right? But it really depends on what are the uh the key points, right? The key parameters we're looking to, right? So, um I wonder if using our current technology, uh you know, like remote sensing, if we can tell those gradients, uh so maybe just from the surface, maybe not in the subsurface, maybe something is more interesting and current below the surface. So, I think uh that'll be better we know we have both information. So, yeah.",
