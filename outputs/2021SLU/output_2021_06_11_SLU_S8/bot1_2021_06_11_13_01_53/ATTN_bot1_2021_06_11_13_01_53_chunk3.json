You know, I mean the there was big news uh a couple of years ago and Jackie Gordiel published this paper saying she had found a corner of the the McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica that uh had uh you know, no uh it had some remnant DNA and there's stuff died there. Um but there is no RNA, there is really no ATP to speak of I think she and so she kind of posited this was the cold dry UV uh limit of life on earth. And there was just another paper and another sort of corner of Dry Valleys that was like that and and these are really classically defined kind of limits of life like water activity, temperature.",

I think uh, you know, even on earth, you know, we have uh, you know, a variety of organisms, microorganisms that can live under those extreme environments, right? Like from very acidic to very basic pH and and also you know like the boiling point of water. So they can survive under those extreme conditions. Uh but the question I think, you know, will be uh so we only know those exist like on earth, but maybe like in outer, you know, exoplanets. So if there's life, they can also get adapted, right? So adapting to the to those specific environments, right? So they can evolve to maybe uh even like robust organisms, they can survive even more extreme environments. So that's something we don't know yet. You know, we only have earth as example, but we don't know if this is the case, you know, those are the limits for these organisms to live, right? In outer, you know, space. So yeah.",
