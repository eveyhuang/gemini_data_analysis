Because one of the arguments for identifying oxygen false positives is abiotic oxygen by hydrogen escape can build up to really high levels and you don't expect that for life. we've just blown a hole in that. Uh so okay, so how's this connection to detectability? Basically, um if you have lots of O2 then you have an O2 O4 signal or something. Uh Shawn, yeah.

Um, we covered everything, starting off from our really wonderful prompt, which touched on the idea that there are lots of things to consider when you look for habitable worlds, where should you look, what types of environments are habitable, and which of those environments are also detectable. Um and Chris just put the notes for our discussion in the chat if you want to read along. Uh the summary here is that the first point we discussed in great detail was that not all life might lead to detectable signatures and there's probably a spectrum of detectability. You might have some life that's just glaringly obvious, especially on the techno signature end of the spectrum and then other types of life that are a bit more subtle. At the very end of the discussion, we were discussing how if you had a planet where all the life is in the ocean, maybe you could even have different limits on the overall atmospheric composition for the planet than if you had surface life. You don't have to worry as much about fires perhaps in that case.",
