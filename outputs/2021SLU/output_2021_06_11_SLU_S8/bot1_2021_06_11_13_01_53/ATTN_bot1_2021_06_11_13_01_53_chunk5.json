And I think these are not necessarily right now overlapping because we're still in the we're there are still so many unknowns that we need to figure out in the latter question than in the first question. Um so maybe these are so all I'm saying is that these are really two different questions that have I think that require different sets of of skills and um to tackle them. And the fact that we will find some best uh you know, straightforward target to go and find maybe find life on this will not necessarily mean that life are not more pervasive across places that otherwise we wouldn't think that they are. And maybe even more so, right? So our our the low hanging fruit is not necessarily the most common fruit. This is what I'm trying to say.",

And I would suggest that we just try to find as many things as we can and study them as well as we can. Um but in the near future, we saw Vicky's talk yesterday and the transit the transmission spectroscopy signal from a planet around a really teeny star is just so much bigger than the signal around a planet orbiting a star that's just a little bigger.

And it's I think often people think of uh second generation planets is something that, you know, form very much like um you know, our the first generation planets from a protoplanetary disc and you need all of this. But in fact in um after a star dies and you get a white dwarf, you get lots of little instabilities that you can have um planets that initially did not uh did not host um water or did not have enough uh the best condition to form uh to form life. Uh but you reseed them because this um process of becoming a white dwarf change the dynamics of the um of the system and we show that it can actually push a lot of little rocks and uh you know, from um from the um well, I need to back down back up for a second, sorry. There is a piece of information that I didn't say. Most stars like to live in binaries. It's the most important thing that I want to say. Um and and therefore, if I have a system where the stellar binary companion did not do much, you know, it was far away, didn't care for anything. Um and the system evolved as is, right? We can hide um we know that we don't have a companion, but we can hide a uh dark and dark star up to 1,000 AU and it will not affect at all our system. So if I have a system like this, um but not dark this time, and one of the stars became white dwarf, now the the companion star these are the time scales when it will start to shoot all kind of material from the um from the um well, I need to back down back up for a second, sorry.

There is a piece of information that I didn't say. Most stars like to live in binaries. It's the most important thing that I want to say. Um and and therefore, if I have a system where the stellar binary companion did not do much, you know, it was far away, didn't care for anything. Um and the system evolved as is, right? We can hide um we know that we don't have a companion, but we can hide a uh dark and dark star up to 1,000 AU and it will not affect at all our system. So if I have a system like this, um but not dark this time, and one of the stars became white dwarf, now the the companion star these are the time scales when it will start to shoot all kind of material from the um from the um well, I need to back down back up for a second, sorry.
