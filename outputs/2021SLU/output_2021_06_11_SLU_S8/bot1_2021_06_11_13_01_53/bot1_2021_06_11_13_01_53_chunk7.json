So uh so if we you know, there's life, there's some activities, maybe over time, you know, geological time there could be some changes we can observe from the atmosphere, uh you know, rather than just you know, seasonal changes or maybe yearly changes. Uh so maybe we can capture some differences about the changes and that can give us some clue about uh the activities of maybe biological activities, you know, of those exoplanets, something like that. So so it really depends on the the timing, right? So when we you know, try to reach out, right? To collect this data and you know, which data we should compare to, maybe over time, so we can see some you know, geological or maybe some chemical changes over time. So.",

Like if you could resolve earth's uh hemispheric differences, you would see pretty remarkable albedo changes. Even if you couldn't do that, if you could just measure, you know, trace gas compositions, you would see CO2 fluctuations, you you would see signals that would point you towards a biosphere that's responding to seasonal forcings. And so, you know, a planet that has very little low seasonality may actually be a less good target than a planet that has strong seasonality. Um in terms of identifying uh inhabitedness.",

Um because to some extent if you uh if you're into uh if you're into O2 or or ozone, um it's it it might be now. Um ish, now ish. Um if you uh into methane and possibly hazes uh for instance, um then it could be uh you know, very early periods of of earth's history. Um and if but if you one of the things that we did recently that's kind of maybe a little little bit weird um is to project into the future. Um and in in in about uh you know, 800 million years or so give or take 100 million years, uh the carbon silicate cycle will draw CO2 down to the point that um the the atmosphere uh may flip back to being very reducing as it was in the Arcaean. Um but the the what that's what happens, the CO2 level is so low because you're so advanced along the carbon silicate cycle pathway that that haze formation uh might be even easier than it was in the Arcaean perhaps. Um so it might be you know, if you're if you're a haze haze type then it might actually be, you know, a billion years from now.",
