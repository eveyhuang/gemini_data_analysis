So if if you know, half of all the earth like planets had had a moon like ours, we could probably detect that and do a real statistical test on something that primary, you know, has a major effect on astrobiology, but I I have no idea how common, you know, the the moon around the earth is.

So so it's not I I completely had the same idea that you had before that uh that a moon was essential, but every biologist I've spoken so far actually uh does not agree with that notion. So I think it's something that um is very interesting to see, you know, how often do these crashes happen and I think uh an even more interesting thing is like are these crashes a requirement or very useful for plate tectonics? I think this is where it becomes actually very interesting because that is different, right? So the moon is now stabilizing or doing the rotation thing or stabilizing the seasons, but maybe it's helping get plate tectonics started. That's uh kind of line of thought that a couple of people were thinking about making a moon potentially important. Sorry, but um is there anything that that you guys want to want to discuss of those ideas or do we just have a potpourri of ideas and then whenever you have like the the get together with all the the fellows only, uh you're going to flesh out something more?

I mean, um right now, you know, we're we're doing this a lot in galactic science where um, you know, what can you really learn from the observations? Moving from theoretical space to observable space and saying, okay, so what are these great observatories really going to give you and how does that track back to the the theory. And that also is going to answer the question sample size and resolution limits. So I'm sure this has been done with or you know, somebody has must must have already done these types of calculations in terms of um how bad can you degrade things before you it becomes unrecoverable and then what are the key parameters of interest. So I think it's really a cross talk between theorists and um, you know, and observers and experimentalists, which is I think leads to to that last point of the need for interdisciplinary teams. ",
