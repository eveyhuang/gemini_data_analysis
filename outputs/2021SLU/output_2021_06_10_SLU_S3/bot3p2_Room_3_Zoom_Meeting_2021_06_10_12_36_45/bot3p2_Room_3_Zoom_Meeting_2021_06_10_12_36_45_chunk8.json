And um, thank you all for your willingness to participate in this uh discussion. That's all from my side. I don't know if there are any other thoughts or ideas. It's never too late, right?

Unfortunately, it's not like in the corridor after a coffee or something, but uh hopefully this thing works with the gather town or whatever they're using.",

So I think uh find the people whose faces you don't recognize and ask them if they're interested in this idea and see where they're from, you know. Uh, but yeah, so first breakout session, great job everyone. Sorry, uh this is a little clunky. Next year it's going to get a lot better when we're in the room and actually uh talk to each other in person. Uh, but there's a lot of great ideas. Uh, and Nicole, thank you very much for volunteering and presenting this. Um, then I think uh should we go back to the main room maybe?",
