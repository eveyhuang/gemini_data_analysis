And I don't know Daniel, um, I I think I really like the idea that uh we're just all going to take like a minute to write some thoughts down so everybody can actually focus on this meeting before we get started if that's okay. So then I'll basically set a timer and everybody has one minute to write something down physically. If you want, you know, uh and then we can just use that as a start of a discussion like what's needed, what would be thing you want to have, what should we tackle to get this idea about how to find something with kind of sizes, what do we need? Do we need one? Do we need 10? Do we need 500? I'm not going to say anything more because you have your own ideas and that's exactly what we want to get to here.",
