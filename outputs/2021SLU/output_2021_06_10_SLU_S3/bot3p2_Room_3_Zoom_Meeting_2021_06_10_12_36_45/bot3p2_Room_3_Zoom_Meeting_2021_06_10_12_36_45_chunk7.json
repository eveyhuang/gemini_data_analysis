How would we distinguish between a stable climate and there being some fraction of planets with surface liquid water oceans versus like episodic uh presence of surface liquid water oceans to get at this question. Is there a way to do that?",

            "transcript": "I think ideally you'd want a sample of planets all roughly the same age and then you could see what fraction of them have liquid water and you wouldn't know. Is that the fraction that have liquid water at that given instant or is that the fraction that ever had liquid water? Um but we've done theoretical studies of having planets freeze over and then melt again or have cycles in their evolution. So I think if you couple this with a bunch of models of planets then maybe you could eventually get at that and then maybe you would have signs like if you were somehow able to measure the D to H ratio perhaps you could see signs of water loss over longer time scales in these systems. But then you wouldn't know what the original ratio was unless you had other planets in the system and it like it gets much more complicated as you ask these questions and I think it it all points back to wanting a really big sample which is hard.",

Need to develop a flow down methodology strategy that allows the necessary sample size to be refined as more information from either exoplanets or solar system, this is where I'm trying to loop in the solar system stuff becomes available.

Um and so you can push to lower signal noise and lower resolutions than using traditional methods. Um and so methodology you know, having hybrid approaches to methodologies, not just traditional approaches for measuring you know, atmospheric parameters, actually building in machine learning tools is going to be an important part of of how you go from um dealing with small sample sizes when you to going to dealing with large sample sizes or large volumes of data. Um that's maybe the main lesson learned but that probably is not going to be so much of an issue here because everything can probably run by PT analysis given that it's, you know, five to 500 systems. Um, but it might be the case that some of the molecular stuff especially on the M dwarf side really needs um, you know, very difficult line lists and molecular features that are very poorly understood. So maybe machine learning there might be very helpful in the future for dealing with M dwarf atmospheres.",

They'll have a different evolution, they have a different maybe metallicity, they have a different age. How you'd actually put that into context? Because, you know, you pick five but they're still going to have gone through a completely different or trying to find five completely similar star systems that you can observe at similar distances will not be very possible. So I'm kind of asking the question in a way it's like how would you be able to put evolution in or would you not, right? And it comes a little bit of what, you know, Leslie was was asking is like would you know that this water is temporary or not? You you would not, right? And you would not know if this system has actually maintained the water through the last four billion years. Like we have there was no way of getting to that. But so how to um how to interpret whatever you find. You know, even if you have five, if you have 100, if you have 500 uh how that changes your interpretation.",

Moving from theoretical space to observable space and saying, okay, so what are these great observatories really going to give you and how does that track back to the the theory. And that also is going to answer the question sample size and resolution limits. So I'm sure this has been done with or you know, somebody has must must have already done these types of calculations in terms of um how bad can you degrade things before you it becomes unrecoverable and then what are the key parameters of interest.
