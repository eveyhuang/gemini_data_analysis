Um, and this goes back to defining the like the original science question, are people generally more excited about broad questions like, you know, the one that I posed the oxidized versus reduced that basically just relies on maybe identifying key molecules, is that exciting enough to people or are is the idea that like you would really want to go after like a a definite composition and that would require like high precision spectroscopy.",

And it's probably not going to be the case, at least it wasn't in galactic science where you go from a sample of five to suddenly you have a sample of a billion. The closest we've got is Gaia where we went from a sample of 100,000 to a billion. So I don't see, you know, I I think that there's even in the next phase beyond what's what's coming up now, uh samples are going to have to be chosen very carefully. And so it's going to be very important I think to um think about the correlations uh between the the you know, the planet properties that we do get for those for those, you know, nearest by systems and um other other properties of the system.",

So I remember say say we're looking for, you know, at just a sample of five planets to see if they have oxidizing or reducing atmospheres. What's the prediction in the first place? Should they all have oxidizing atmospheres and we find that two have reducing atmospheres, that's that's interesting. Um, so the the the defining the predictions in in the first place rather than just going and looking for correlations, I think is going to be helpful.",

And I think I think the way I see this question is basically we uh and why why this is important, right? Is basically the sample size is a fundamental parameter of any telescope that we would be building. And currently the running rate is about $300 million per planet if you can't uh both ground based and space based, that's roughly the within a factor of two. So that's a key science parameter that determines the architecture, it determines what size of pet you want to build, but we are building both an exploration mission and also a hypothesis testing science mission at the same time. And so I think that uh I I think this is a really interesting discussion to see what what is the complexity that we expect and what is the right strategy and what kind of complexity can we test in a population that we haven't explored yet.",

They just assume if you aim for the hardest thing that you will naturally get all of the other fruit that hangs below, but I don't think that's actually the case especially for some of the questions that we're asking here. And it comes back to this resolution thing as well and so thinking of really about how um we need to have that again hierarchy which I'll I will make sure gets into our slides of of questions and of thinking about developing strategies that are based uh more on that hierarchy rather than just like I need to find O2, right?",

And that included both trying to figure out the frequency of Earth like planets and building a statistical sample that would give us enough to be able to say something about if we didn't find any life, what does that actually mean and have a useful number. Um but also looking at larger planets and trying to look at planetary systems as a whole. Um and I think that was really fruitful because it wasn't just one question. It wasn't just is there oxygen on this particular planet or on these 10 planets. It was actually allowing us to do more than just search for life. Um and Havoc has a different design and had to make different choices about the number of planets, but they also I think did that really creatively. So it'd be interesting to compare those two strategies.",

So I think there are there are perhaps some questions that are completely inaccessible to the smaller Havoc scale meeting like mission, like um time variability on a given planet perhaps. But the other questions that you could address with either, it would be kind of the level of scope. Like and and it would be somewhat what you would like if 50 if 50% of planets in the habitable zone have a detectable bio signature, then Havoc would detect one, but if that's optimistically not the case, then um you'd have a null result and just set some kind of upper limit. And and the upper limit that you'd get from a null result with Havoc is just a lot less informative than with Luvoir. It's still informative given our current prior state of knowledge, but um yeah, I I would kind of divide the questions into two different categories. There's some that you could just still do with Havoc, but definitely do way better with Luvoir and then there are others that like just are inaccessible.",

Is there some things that kind of you wish uh you could have done differently or wish it was done that wasn't actually included in those because you know they have big NASA missions and they have a cost cap and so on and so forth. And the idea of this workshop is to basically throw what we know out of the window and the constraints that we know out of the window, not to say that you can just build a 20 meter telescope, but to to basically basically free your thinking because we can't we all come in with this with baggage, right? Because we've worked on this on different instruments and so on and so forth. So if we just erase that slate, right? If we erase Havoc, if we erase Luvoir, um I don't know, is there something that we can do theoretically uh or or practically, you know, which is like some you know, the idea is this allows us to mix and even if the ideas are crazy and if we don't come up with something that's fine, but I'm just thinking this this is kind of a unique opportunity to think about what we could be doing because this is I'm throwing something out that I don't think you should be doing. I was like, let's just go only for white dwarfs and see if life survives the explosion of the star, right? Not what you should be doing, but that direction, right? It's like I don't know.",
