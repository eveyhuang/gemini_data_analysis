Do you want to do a big survey to answer one question whether the atmosphere is reducing or oxidizing or do you want to find a promising looking plan and go deep? Because as a responsible scientist I would say, oh yeah, let's do a careful statistical study, but as a human being I'm here for the aliens and I want to go really deep on one planet, right? So how do we balance those competing interests and the potential for discovery with a little bit high more high risk or reward.",

So, um, you know, detecting binary planets or a moon around an Earth is something that we we plausibly could do if they were pretty common. So if if you know, half of all the earth like planets had had a moon like ours, we could probably detect that and do a real statistical test on something that primary, you know, has a major effect on astrobiology, but I I have no idea how common, you know, the the moon around the earth is.",

            "transcript": "I think just like a very short comment on that, like talking to the biologists that do evolution, they don't really care about the moon. They uh, I think this is sometimes a notion that we have because we have one, but they are saying if life actually evolved on a planet without a moon where the the climate is maybe not as stable or seasonal, shouldn't matter, especially not if it's in the ocean or subsurface or if it evolved for it. So so it's not I I completely had the same idea that you had before that uh that a moon was essential, but every biologist I've spoken so far actually uh does not agree with that notion. So I think it's something that um is very interesting to see, you know, how often do these crashes happen and I think uh an even more interesting thing is like are these crashes a requirement or very useful for plate tectonics? I think this is where it becomes actually very interesting because that is different, right? So the moon is now stabilizing or doing the rotation thing or stabilizing the seasons, but maybe it's helping get plate tectonics started. That's uh kind of line of thought that a couple of people were thinking about making a moon potentially important. Sorry, but um is there anything that that you guys want to want to discuss of those ideas or do we just have a potpourri of ideas and then whenever you have like the the get together with all the the fellows only, uh you're going to flesh out something more? I don't know.",

So this this whole conversation about the moon is a prime example of that that we can describe the characteristics of the earth, but we don't know which of them are actually essential. Um, so we could talk about the challenges of sample size both on the solar system perspective and the ex solar system perspective. So perhaps one of the other things that we would want for this study is a better understanding of our own solar system and the regions nearby where life exists because that can help us determine what parameter space we might even be looking for.",
