Um, I think Vicky had said something in her um um keynote address, which is basically like the nearest handful of systems, nearest five or so systems, we might be able to get detailed atmospheric um, and someone can can correct me if I'm wrong on that. Um, you know, atmospheric abundances or at least atmospheric parameters for um nearby exoplanets. Um, and I think that uh it would be really interesting to see how far one can push uh the predictions of uh exoplanet atmospheres and biosignatures um into uh either being able to predict what futures uh missions can I be able to do or try to find some correlations with um things that are a little bit easier to observe like the stars themselves. So that's that's kind of the angle that I would come at it from is what what can we say um about exoplanet uh habitability or at the very minimums uh the this the uh possibility for life uh with correlated with properties of the star because that's just going to be so much easier for us to get large sample sizes. So the the the thought that comes to my mind and and the thing that I pitched in the last log was actually um phosphorus, looking at the the role that phosphorus might play in search for life and um trying to measure phosphorus and stars across the universe and beyond.",

Um, I don't know if those like types of those types of questions would get more at the what is the diversity of atmospheres instead of saying like is there oxygen or not.",

So maybe you try to find stars that are all the same age and the same mass, but they have different metallicities and you see how that affects the planet atmosphere when the planets are all in the same size and mass range. that would be fascinating.",

To define the the sample size and also just what exactly what kinds of planets we need to be looking at like what Coco was also mentioning. Um, we we need to define the questions. Um, in that sense I I I'm really looking forward to this meeting talking to some of the non astronomers to to help us uh to help us figure out what the what the right questions are for establishing habitability, biological activity, things like that.",

Yeah, I think um when we're thinking about this theoretically, we would all like a nice laboratory where we could, you know, do what Courtney said and change metallicity and look at 30 planets there and then change some other planet some other property and look at planets there. And I think um at least initially we're not going to be so lucky. Um, we're going to have a very, very small number of planets. They're going to have 12 different properties each, their stars are going to have different properties. Um, and that's that's realistically how we're going to start and we're going to learn a lot then and probably refine the experiment as we go as astronomers do unlike normal laboratory scientists.",

It's like 51 peg was one planet and it completely blew open our understanding of what planets could be like and completely revised what we thought. So I think there's a space for both. So I agree.

What do you need, you know, how robust the biosignatures and so on.
