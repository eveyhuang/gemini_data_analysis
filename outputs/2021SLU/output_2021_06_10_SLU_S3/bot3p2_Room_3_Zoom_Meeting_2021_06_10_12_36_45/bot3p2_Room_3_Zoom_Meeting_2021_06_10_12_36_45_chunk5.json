You know and even if it's there if you have just one planet saying that the earth actually this is really a sign of life will be really hard if you have 10 if you have 50 if you have 100 it's going to be different. Um but if we just think about um what our strategy would be like it doesn't have to be any strategy that anybody invented before in terms of we have all these different kinds of stars out there with all these different kinds of planetary architectures what would be a strategy if we get 50 planets or 50 systems we can look at 100 systems we can look at five systems we can look at. And we don't have the answer but that question is that might be something interesting.",

So Anot who introduced herself she's one of the facilitators is a kind of geoscientist at Carnegie. Um and she was on our web program and offered some really interesting insight and that was kind of like where the idea of that was born from because um at at the end of the day like compositions are going to be hard to come by and our constraints on abundance aren't going to be very good. Um and so and and sometimes we'll only get the dominant background gas and we won't even kind of have an understanding of what trace species are doing. Uh and so if you can if if if all you've got is kind of a background gas and maybe um all right I shouldn't say background gas I should say like dominant molecular, you know, absorber, it's kind of like the only thing that you get. But from a geologist standpoint it's something that they can work with because um because they can connect that to the to the composition of outgassing or something like that. Um yeah.",

So that's kind of what I digested.",

I I was just thinking about the idea of probing uh atmospheres at the at the inner edge of the habitable zone if one could I mean this would have to be flushed out more but if one could make measurements of atmospheric just just rough measurements of atmospheric composition for planets that are notionally interior to and just within the habitable zone looking for expected changes in in atmospheric composition that could be that could be interesting and maybe feasible in the near term but again it would need to be flushed out with uh with help from uh from some of our planetary science colleagues.",
