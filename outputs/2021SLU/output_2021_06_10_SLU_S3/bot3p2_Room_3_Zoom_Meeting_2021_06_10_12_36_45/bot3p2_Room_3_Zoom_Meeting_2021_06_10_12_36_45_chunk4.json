But if we just abstract from that what would we do differently and maybe also we can bring back a little bit the bio signature. Uh if we detect something that is possibly a bio signature how would we actually interpret that or explore that and let's I think Andy wanted to mention something and I was cutting and so I that's not a problem.",

Um, so I think that I mean I think that that's one of the statistical issues is is just going after understanding the context first, right? We don't we don't necessarily we we we don't entirely know the context in which we're working. We know Earth. But we don't we don't actually know what a rocky M star planet looks like, what its atmosphere is, if it's anything like what what we've predicted just based on based on taking Earth and and rescaling it to to a different star.",

So if the idea is that we need the ground based to do something for space based and the other way around, um, that's also definitely a possibility or you know, small space graph with ELT in combination.

And the thing I'm thinking about at the moment, which is not really on this topic is what if instead of a telescope, we don't really worry about focusing the light well and we just use a light bucket and throw all of our uh, you know, cards into like a huge, huge equivalent diameter transmission spectroscopy mission where we don't really have a good image, but it doesn't matter because we're pointing it at Proxima Centuri or Trapist one and we just get so much light that we can do this for more distant planets.

You what what happens if you what what's the observation that you make that you start with five and then if you see something with those five, then you double the sample, but maybe now include stellar age or stellar type as another access over which you're investigating. basically how you how you might build out the statistical sample um in a in a systematic way based on on on some guiding question.",
