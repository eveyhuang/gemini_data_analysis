Um and so and and sometimes we'll only get the dominant background gas and we won't even kind of have an understanding of what trace species are doing. Uh and so if you can if if if all you've got is kind of a background gas and maybe um all right I shouldn't say background gas I should say like dominant molecular, you know, absorber, it's kind of like the only thing that you get. But from a geologist standpoint it's something that they can work with because um because they can connect that to the to the composition of outgassing or something like that. Um yeah. ",

So so it's not I I completely had the same idea that you had before that uh that a moon was essential, but every biologist I've spoken so far actually uh does not agree with that notion. So I think it's something that um is very interesting to see, you know, how often do these crashes happen and I think uh an even more interesting thing is like are these crashes a requirement or very useful for plate tectonics? I think this is where it becomes actually very interesting because that is different, right? So the moon is now stabilizing or doing the rotation thing or stabilizing the seasons, but maybe it's helping get plate tectonics started.

Um that's maybe the main lesson learned but that probably is not going to be so much of an issue here because everything can probably run by PT analysis given that it's, you know, five to 500 systems.
