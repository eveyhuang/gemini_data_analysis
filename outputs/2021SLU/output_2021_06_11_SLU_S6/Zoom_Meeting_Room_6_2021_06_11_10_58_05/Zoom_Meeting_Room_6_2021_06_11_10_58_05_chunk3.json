He basically saying the the presence of Jupiter stopped the icy pebble drift to the inner region. So that's why we have a pretty dry earth. Um yeah, so I think it would be really interesting to see the presence of giant planets relative to the snow line location at the beginning and how earlier giant planets form in the system and change the impact of the the water content for the inner region. Well you you can also imagine you have a compact system with a bunch of equal roughly equal mass of super earth and how the water content should be different from a planet inside a giant.",

You you can do that, but that is very expensive because you need to run a whole thing and and you know, you set your you set your Jupiter wherever it is. And that that that really limits on how many times you can change and find the dependency. And then the other way that people are using it is something that called the Opic method, which um I've kind of was a little bit annoyed with recently because it really originated from our own solar system of looking at um at the Jupiter family comets, which are really in a specific location.",

But if you think about the ort cloud of or if you think about um our our own Quiper belt that has some thickness to it, um the Opic method starts to fail. So then all the predictions are not so good. So this is something that I've been thinking about a lot recently and I think that um trying from analytical point of view to try to really understand how this behavior will like exactly what you asked, where will I put the Jupiter in order to know how many impacts I'll get from different positions. I I think this requires something that well I'm plugging it in. But so something that we're working on now really to try to uh to find a a new way um it's it's pretty straightforward actually, but any way to try to uh to generalize the Opic method to different um to different configurations and to generalize to general rocks that they can come from wherever and not necessarily from uh you know, the same plane that Jupiter lies. So it's really exciting for me from this point of view apart from all the other point of views that you guys have talked about.",

Um and you ask where it can live, you use the Tiran parameter, I never know how to pronounce it well. So it assumes that the it assumes something about the um the the orbit itself. It assumes where the particle is. It seems that it's in the in the same plane. Um it's the assumes that the orbit is um circular and then from this they um they have this uh uh they generalize to above and below. So you can show actually that the this type of um restricted three body system can you can well, it's not really wave your hands, but you can show that it can work also if you go um to arbitrary inclination, but it has a lot of limitation because the parameter is actually not applicable in arbitrary inclination. So it's kind of a mix and match of I I don't know. I I I I'm I'm I'm confused on why why it was used so much. Um so and then it calculates the probability of collision. So you assume uh uh and also the probability of collision is estimated is just crossing the orbit. But crossing the orbit is not guarantee a collision. I can have a rock crossing the orbit and nothing will happen. So it's overestimating the probability of collision.",
