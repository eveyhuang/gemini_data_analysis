Um, and so yeah, I guess the question is, you know, can you can you use like a giant planet a few AU as a sign post that there's going to be a potentially habitable terrestrial world or more broadly, is there anything useful that you can learn from other planets in a in a system that will tell you something about the potentially habitable worlds there.

But then there are these studies like for uh for example from Hilke's Hilke Schlichting's work, they showed that when you have something that explodes in a already formed um an atmosphere, you expel bunch of stuff um and not necessarily gain. So I wonder if this is at the time of the impact, right? So it depends when the impact took place, right? Because Hilke's models really assumes a very well defined atmosphere and a core and maybe when things are still in the mix and start just forming, then you get the water delivery and after that you expel because you heat up the planet then you expel water or you evaporate whatever it is there. Um so then it's also interesting to think about this in the context of a giant planet where whether or not it will shield us or or shield the planet, not necessarily just us.
