      "transcript": "if you think life originated in hydrothermal vents, presumably you run into problem when you start having like super critical water at the bottom of your ocean or high pressure ices or something. But if you think some other people say that life originated in like these shallow pools, like tidal pools and stuff like that, well they're they're hosed, right? If you if you're on a water world, there's no there's no tidal pools. Um and uh and so there might be like a real kind of Goldilocks thing in terms of the amount of water you have. Um and I think it would be fun to to try and I I know at this meeting there's at least one or more like people who study like hydrothermal systems and life in there and it would be fun to try and like grab one of those people and and actually look at, you know, so there could be like two sort of related projects. I realize these projects have to be really small because they're all like two or three people, right? Each one. So um I I don't think I would have anything terribly intelligent to contribute to to your kind of planet formation angle of this Coco, but I'd be really interested in doing something related to that more on the like the structure of these planets and what's going on at the bottom of these oceans um by by working with someone who understands hydrothermal vents, which is like not me.",

And and I I know there are a number of GCM simulations and also including ocean circulation simulations that are usually exploring pretty, you know, earthlike systems. There are a couple for like uh aqua planets too, but I think that's definitely a direction that is not fully explored at all. So and maybe that's also linked to the presence of uh maybe that could lead to a hypothesis that could be tested on a long term with the planet properties and the architecture. There is a connection between the delivery and the presence of giant planet potentially.",

      "transcript": "Yeah, so Paul, there's uh I I mean maybe I I simple way of stating this is just that the optimal amount of water is probably different for an M earth than for like an earth earth because of this tidal locking. And if you on a on a M earth, if you're afraid that you're going to lock up all of your ice on some big night side glacier, then maybe you want like a lot more water so that some of that the glacier gets so heavy that some of it flows back to the day side and melts.",

Like do you start the planet from like like having deep oceans of like deep ocean basins and then continents that are like 4 kilometers up higher or do you start the entire planet with just kind of like a dry barren world that just magically has a bunch of water on it and like these are all like really simple questions that like nobody is modeling because like Daniel said the the GCMs people are running are very very simple and and idealized.",
