   "transcript": "So I have a question. So often people are thinking about um at least in the numerical simulations when they you know, like the tagged in this model, they they assume about the how how how big is, you know, how the water delivery on what you get of water at the end just by counting, you know, things that came beyond the ice line. But then there are these studies like for uh for example from Hilke's Hilke Schlichting's work, they showed that when you have something that explodes in a already formed um an atmosphere, you expel bunch of stuff um and not necessarily gain. So I wonder if this is at the time of the impact, right? So it depends when the impact took place, right? Because Hilke's models really assumes a very well defined atmosphere and a core and maybe when things are still in the mix and start just forming, then you get the water delivery and after that you expel because you heat up the planet then you expel water or you evaporate whatever it is there. Um so then it's also interesting to think about this in the context of a giant planet where whether or not it will shield us or or shield the planet, not necessarily just us. Um or will not help us, right? I don't know if I was clear. It was like a bunch of things in my head.",

So does that mean that you just have no reservoir of volatiles are out in the disc. So around Alpha Centuri for example, um does that mean that there's no Kyper belt anymore? I don't know.

Um all really close in and I think they're all in a resonant chain as well as I remember. Um and then later on through AO imaging, um found a an M dwarf companion and Adam Kraus and Trent to who actually Trent was the first author on the paper showed actually tried to measure the orbital motion of the M dwarf and and realized that it wasn't moving at all or much and basically they used that to constrain that it's on a I think it's on a on a pretty eccentric orbit and from that you can then calculate how close would it have come to the to these this compact system of planets and and it would have basically been close enough to truncate the disc.
