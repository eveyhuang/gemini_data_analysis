   "transcript": "I can go first. Um, something I've always been curious about is what is the role of exterior giant planets for the habitability of habitable zone planets. You know, there's been all this controversy in the literature whether Jupiter does it protect Earth from impacts, does it actually increase the rate of impacts on Earth? Is that a good thing? Is it driving volatile rich material during late heavy bombardment that in you know, subsequently formed our oceans. Um, and so I think the fact that we don't understand that fully for our own solar system kind of points to this being a hard problem. Uh and I think we at least know in exoplanet systems that we don't want those giant planets to migrate inward and and disrupt the inner system, but I think the details beyond that are really interesting to me. That's an excellent point. Okay.",

   "timestamp": "01:15-02:34",
   "transcript": "So I wrote down something sort of along those lines. I was wondering like my understanding is that the solar system is is weird because we don't have any short period planets and we have, you know, giant planets out at a few AU. And so and and I've heard some people I I I feel like it was Greg Laughlin or someone like that at some point at a conference like sort of off the cuff said like maybe this is a condition for getting ending up with habitable planets rather than just like water worlds and that if the planets if the giant planets hadn't migrated around the way they did, then we would have ended up with much more volatile rich terrestrial planets or something along those lines. Um, and so yeah, I guess the question is, you know, can you can you use like a giant planet a few AU as a sign post that there's going to be a potentially habitable terrestrial world or more broadly, is there anything useful that you can learn from other planets in a in a system that will tell you something about the potentially habitable worlds there. And I think the examples people usually give like what Paul was saying is like they're like negative things. Like you see a hot Jupiter say, okay, no habitable planets there.",

   "transcript": "Coco, I had I've been thinking about an idea along those lines from yesterday based on other discussions and it's and it's about so there's habitability so I've I've thought a little bit about the question of like how much water you can have on a planet and have it be habitable and kind of like stuffing some down in the mantle and stuff like that or losing it to space. But but talking to the bio people made me think more about like the origin of life and like how thick of an ocean can you have and still expect hydrothermal vents to be like a a favorable place for the origin of life. Um, and so there might be a slightly different constraint if you ask not just for a habitable planet but a planet that could actually have life originate on it.",

We keep on thinking about habitability as this place in the, you know, the Goldilocks place, but um I I wonder how further we can push it and it can be in the in a solar system and it can be also somewhere in the galaxy. So for example, in a solar system, can we have a moon that is habitable because it's sitting in the right place around a giant and has a um has a lot of of tidal heating and tidal interaction that keeps it warm even though a priori it may not be in the right place around the star. Or if a system is if I have a system with um maybe a planet that again a priori is not the right place around its whole star, but it's actually in a quite dense place in the universe or in the galaxy where we have enough radiation to help it.",
