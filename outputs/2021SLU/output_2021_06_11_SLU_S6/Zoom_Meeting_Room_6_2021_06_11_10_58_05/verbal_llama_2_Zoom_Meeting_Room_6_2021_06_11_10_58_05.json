Um, and so yeah, I guess the question is, you know, can you can you use like a giant planet a few AU as a sign post that there's going to be a potentially habitable terrestrial world or more broadly, is there anything useful that you can learn from other planets in a in a system that will tell you something about the potentially habitable worlds there.

But then there are these studies like for uh for example from Hilke's Hilke Schlichting's work, they showed that when you have something that explodes in a already formed um an atmosphere, you expel bunch of stuff um and not necessarily gain. So I wonder if this is at the time of the impact, right? So it depends when the impact took place, right? Because Hilke's models really assumes a very well defined atmosphere and a core and maybe when things are still in the mix and start just forming, then you get the water delivery and after that you expel because you heat up the planet then you expel water or you evaporate whatever it is there. Um so then it's also interesting to think about this in the context of a giant planet where whether or not it will shield us or or shield the planet, not necessarily just us.

But if you think some other people say that life originated in like these shallow pools, like tidal pools and stuff like that, well they're they're hosed, right? If you if you're on a water world, there's no there's no tidal pools. Um and uh and so there might be like a real kind of Goldilocks thing in terms of the amount of water you have. Um and I think it would be fun to to try and I I know at this meeting there's at least one or more like people who study like hydrothermal systems and life in there and it would be fun to try and like grab one of those people and and actually look at, you know, so there could be like two sort of related projects. I realize these projects have to be really small because they're all like two or three people, right? Each one. So um I I don't think I would have anything terribly intelligent to contribute to to your kind of planet formation angle of this Coco, but I'd be really interested in doing something related to that more on the like the structure of these planets and what's going on at the bottom of these oceans um by by working with someone who understands hydrothermal vents, which is like not me.
