So that's something in my mind that's you know, it's forward thinking, it's clearly hard to do, but I would be excited to think about that more. Maybe make some predictions and can test.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, the the tricky part about this is as as Paul said is the measurements. You need to stay to solar twins to actually get these highly precise differential abundance measurements that then show trends as function of condensation temperature. Um and that's a little bit it's hard to do for a small number of stars. Another thing another access I would mention is stellar multiplicity.",

So I tried to like I wrote a lot, but then I probably wrote too much because now I have a hard time synthesizing it. But maybe I think I identified four main things to talk about. Maybe I'll say these topics and then and then we can decide whether those are those are. So we talked a lot about the impact of giant planets on habitability. We talked about what I call out of the box habitability. So this is you know, galactic habitability or thinking about different ways of habitable zone around not necessarily planet that's habitable but not in the habitable zone.",
