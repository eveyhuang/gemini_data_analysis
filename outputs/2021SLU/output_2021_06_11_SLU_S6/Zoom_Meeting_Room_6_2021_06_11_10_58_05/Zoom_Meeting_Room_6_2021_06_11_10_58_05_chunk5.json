So say, um, like Leslie said we put giant planets at different locations and we say well be the inner planet water content based on current mass radius estimation to put some constraint about the limit um the dry word rocky word versus water word and also combine with disc observation say if you have some large pressure type to see some substructures in the outer disc and JWST can observe many discs with inner water content and make a correlation between the final product and the formation uh stage the water content in the inner region.",

Um, but if we started having some estimate of how much water gets delivered to the habitable zone around different spectral type stars, for example, um then I think there's there's still this question that's that's on the a little bit on the interdisciplinary end of things of like what does that do to the planet both in terms of geophysics and geochemistry and biochemistry at the bottom of the ocean or like, you know, if you think so I gave earlier the example of like.",
