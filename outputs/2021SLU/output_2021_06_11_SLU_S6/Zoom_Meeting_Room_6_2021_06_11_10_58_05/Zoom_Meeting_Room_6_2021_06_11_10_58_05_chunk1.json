And some of you were not in the group I was there yesterday, but all the groups follow of course the same general approach. So what I wanted to suggest is that first we goes through a very brief introduction. I think you all interacted already probably, but maybe just to make sure everybody knows everyone. So we'll keep the introductions pretty short, just name institution, general topics you are working on. And after that we will proceed to identifying a scribe, a recorder who will report back to the main group and then we plunge in into the fun science discussion.",
