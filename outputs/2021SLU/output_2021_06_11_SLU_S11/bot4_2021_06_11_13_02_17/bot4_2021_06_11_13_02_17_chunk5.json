And so I would I would wonder that maybe you have cases where you can get autocatalysis or other relevant things that are not going to be as complex and specific or optimized shall we say, but are more robust in terms of changing conditions. And then when you can control your conditions extremely well, then you can do more things, but you know, then you have to be very controlled.",

Uh in in contrast to to entirely about chemistry, it hasn't it doesn't have the tool to adapt to to change uh in a in a sort of in an optimized way in a in an efficient way.

Um, you know, thinking of the like I think about robustness a lot and you know, I think robustness we think of it as a good thing, but there are I think there are instances where if like for example a chemical reaction, it's like too efficient that it actually doesn't leave room for much chemical evolution, right? You know, for example, if you make this, you know, if you have these monomers and they just shoots to a polymer and then the polymer just stays there, it does it's probably not going to do anything, right? And you know, I'm thinking of you know, like when like when we do like I do a lot of reactions in wet wet dry cycling, right? And part of the power of that is actually in the wet phase is hydrolysis, so water breaking down like some of the polymers back into monomers and shorter sequences. And you know, that that kind of that breaking aspect is actually a really critical part of that process. And you know, like I I almost don't want a reaction that's like too good, you know, like there's almost like a balance there, right? And so I I I I agree with what you're saying but I I think the word robustness can almost like you almost don't want it to be like overly robust, right? else you're just going to accumulate a lot of stuff that's not going to do anything. That that's just that's just kind of how I think about it.",

So um it's it's making me think of the conversations that I've been prebiotic chemistry like 10 years ago, like Shelley Copley published some papers about how we need sparsity in our chemical networks and how we need to have very targeted outcomes. But then there was this discussion of messy chemistry and that's it seemed to me as an outsider like the opposite. And it almost seems like for both prebiotic chemistry and for selection, you need to have somewhere in the middle. You need to have the right amount of variation, the right amount of messiness, but it can't be so messy that you end up with tar, you know, as Steve Benner likes to say. So it's like for both for both the prebiotic chemistry part of it and then later as you're getting to these replicating networks, you need to have some happy medium between the messiness and the and the sparsity.",
