Um, but there are um, we're going to the dunes just south of an impact crater. And we know that there is diverse spectral diversity in the areas between the dunes. Um, and some of those spectral characteristics are the same spectral characteristics that we see of um uh lake associated sediments. Sediments that you see at the bottom of dry lake beds. So on the earth actually, uh like right behind me, the white things that you see kind of on the surface are um sabka uh deposits left behind on these kind of like ephemeral lakes, little playas that are in between these mega mega dunes. Um, so I think it's totally possible that we could see some um uh liquid associated sediments um in the uh interdunes um, and especially if we happen to come across a river or something like that, something that's been mobilized, um, but we aren't directly going to any of the known lakes.",
