And so I was thinking and this could be framed in those terms too, are there jumps that could happen in the functionality of a pre life or prebiotic chemical system that can occur if you have reaction networks that optimize in specific condition spaces or environments, but then are brought together for the first time and or each system that was optimized to its condition space, then the conditions change a bit like Andro was saying. And could you then could that lead you to a boundary that then you go you push to a new state with the system. And could that be something that is the rarity of origin of life where you can get a far a long way in certain chemical systems, but until you combine it with other ones in different conditions, you can never really get past that point. And then my other question was to for catalysis, let's say like enzyme type redox reactions, to improve catalytic function of a reaction, um, to what extent can the catalytic activity of inorganic substrates like iron sulfur clusters be enhanced by the creation of of geologically driven organics to a point, but then where's the limit of that and to what extent do you require an inheritance system to be able to reproduce the same type of catalyst or protein and how far can you get without having a reproducible organic ligand let's say around that cluster.

        "utterance": "Rika Anderson: Sure. Um, my brain is swirling, but I guess just two things. Um, one in response to what Greg was saying, I don't know if this is what you're thinking about, but I used to spend a lot of time thinking about these evolutionary dead ends and how it is that these early replicating networks or these self replicating molecules actually continue to evolve towards greater complexity as opposed to being streamlined to just being really good, really fast replicators. So maybe some of you've heard of a Spiegelman's monster where if you have replicators in test tubes and optimize them over time, you end up with leaner and meaner replicators, but they don't increase in complexity or functionality and I used to wrestle with this a lot, but one thing that people often would say is, well, the environment matters, right? And so the dynamism of an environment can can select for greater functionality over time. So that's something that I kind of mull over. Um, the other thing I was thinking about, I think might be related to what Betul first mentioned, which is this question of at least for me, how do we link natural selection with energy acquisition? Like I I've read a lot of papers about again, self replicating networks, hypercycles, um autocatalytic cycles, how we would get selection in these early stages. And then I've read a lot about proton gradients and harnessing energy across membranes and so on. And what I have yet to make the connection of in my mind is how you bring these two together and is it in the form of an early protocell, is it in, you know, sort of just like limitation on a mineral surface? How do we how do we bring those two things together and and maybe for me too is what methods do we need to use to answer those questions? Because I think that, you know, I use the tools of bioinformatics, so I'm doing very top down work with genomics, but I don't think that at least for my work, I don't think we can get that far. So it might be up to the experimentalist like Laurie to, you know, make your events in the lab and and you know, and create these things and and tell us how that could work and then we could see if we see something similar in the genomic record, but I struggle with this the meeting of the top down and bottom up approaches, so those are just things on my mind.

I you know, I I'm an I'm an analytical chemist and I'm always thinking about how can we measure something?

You know, something that's kind of on that path but maybe not there yet. And I think that's really difficult. I mean, you know, just I'm I'm a chemist and you know, thinking of when you when you throw in these really complex systems, right? the analytical tools that I'm familiar with, it's hard to actually capture that system interaction experimentally, right? You know, like so I'm I'm a mass spectrometrist for instance, right? And you know, people do mass spectrometry of cells and things all the time, right? And what they do is they, you know, they lice the cells and they look at the lipids, they look at the metabolites or they um, you know, they digest the proteins and the peptides and look at those, but you can't really see those molecular interactions through mass spectrometry, right? And so, you know, people have to do things like where they um tag molecules and look at like fluorescence microscopy or you know, things I mean, I'm I'm just my head is thinking about how do we how do we actually see something that's in in the middle. And I think that's really hard and maybe that's part of the reason why there's I mean there is kind of some gap I mean there's a lot of gap there. I like I I remember Greg I I heard you give a talk once about kind of your your work kind of thinking about that the space between that, right?
