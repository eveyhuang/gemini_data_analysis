Um the the lakes are um not super soluble. Uh but that's why I really like Laurie's definition as well of um place placing things back along a spectrum. I was going to ask will we know, you know, if we had if we do some experiments and have a better understanding about the actual emergence of life, um I think it's only then that we're going to be able to define what the prebiotic chemistry is. Like, isn't it possible that some of these directed pathways that you're talking about Laurie might be um part of the prebiotic sequence that we just don't know yet because we haven't traced it back from the other side if that makes sense.",

So even if you find life elsewhere, like this is all agnostic bias, you know, it could be any type of life, but also evolution could be directed differently, all kinds of things could be different. I don't personally, I don't think the goal should be look for life elsewhere. I think it should be characterize organic chemical states of planets and understand what life is. Because without a definition of life, it's kind of impossible to do either origin of life or life detection. Like we've learned a lot in the past 20 years about what life is.",

What they how they estimate error is like they'll they'll flip the sequences in their database and they'll see how many hits they get and they compare that to what they do it when it's going forward, right? And so um in they just call like a false discovery rate, you know, and and I I think as obviously we're like you said, we're not really at a point where we can like quanti like quantitate like how confident are we that this is life or this is potential life or things like that. But that's something that we'll have to think about in the future is as, you know, maybe in 30 years maybe we can be more quantitative about that. Um and as as as we can have like a kind of like a quantitative or positive, we'll have to quantitate an error as well. And um I think I I think there are potential ways to do that like on an experimental basis, but um it's just something that we'll have to keep in the back of our mind. But I agree. I don't I don't think that we're there we're there yet. Yeah.",
