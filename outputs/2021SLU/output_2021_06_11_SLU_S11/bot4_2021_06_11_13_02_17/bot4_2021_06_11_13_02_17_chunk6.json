So if you have like you said, you know, the sea of amino acids, but yet there is an organism that is utilizing it, you know, the abiotic chemistry, you can take those amino acids and just degrade them and just turn them into mush or polymerize them to all random ways. But biology like you said, would take them along a certain, we were talking about this in the last meeting, along a very certain path. So there would be a very distinct way to to to monitor a sample of of some sort of organism, whatever it is, but looking at that chemistry is going to be very conservative, presumably, even if it is eating feeding off the environment of more complex organic compounds. So that's one way, I mean, it's complex, but that's one way that we could um measure that, I guess.",

And um, you know, like I'm I make abiotic polymers in my lab all the time with my students, that's what we that's what we do, right? And um, you know, like most you know, most of the time they're, you know, even even if you have a really complex mixture of monomers, right? You know, you can you kind of like I think Laurie said this, you kind of get this like statistical distribution of products, right? And um, you know, when you're looking at, you know, like when you're looking at peptides from a biological system, that's not the case, right? And so, and even when you get when you go to a further level, like there when you when you break these molecules apart, you can see differences in their sequences and things like that, right? And so, um, I definitely think there are potential ways to do that, but I I I don't think necessarily that that space has been explored that much yet. I mean, maybe a little bit, but um, not not a ton. I think there's definitely a lot of room there.",

And you know, and and not all the, you know, for example, you know, I I go back to amino acids because that's what I that's what I work with the most, right? And so not different amino acids have different reactivities just due to solubility, differences in solubility, differences in sterics. Um, right? And so it's not like all of them react the same amount either, right? Um, but you kind of like you can kind of get it you can actually figure that kind of stuff out, right? And um, you know, that's kind of one of the things that we're trying to do in my lab. But yeah, no I so I mean we're starting at the like amino acid kind of monomer level. We're not necessarily making them, right? We're just putting them in there, right? And so you're right, if you're going to do some type of um kind of like protometabolism where these these are actually products of other processes, then yeah, I agree. I agree with that.

So you probably have thought very deeply about um different types of measurements um within the context like of a suite of instruments that you would put on a mission. So do you want to say a couple things about that? Sure. So I mean, I kind of think of in some ways origin of life and the mission thought process is a little bit similar because with origin of life you you conceptually break life down into its components and then you got to come up with some way for each of those to to exist without life in order for it to be life because if you define origin of life as say life without RNA, well then, you know, what? So like you basically have to kind of take each part and have abiotic ways and then all together it is life and that's your origin.",

So it's things like, you know, do we have organic molecules? What kind are they? Carbon isotopes. People look at things like cell motility or imaging. There's atmospheric detection of things that we think are just made by life and it just kind of depends on what your spacecraft constraints are and there's all sorts of technical problems here. But basically it is in some ways similar because if you detect let's say a carbon molecule or molecules or a distribution or a functionality like an autocatalytic reaction or something like that together is it life? Because you know that each one of those can happen abiotically, otherwise you could not have life's origin.",

I think it's important because I I also you know, hearing this sort of looking at the size of the molecules or even the complexity of the molecule that's generated, that alone is not quite an indicator. You can argue that an elephant and an ant has the same complexity. In fact, I think ants are more complex than an elephant. So you know, generation of big molecules or the size themselves are not indicators, but it's more almost about the generation of some sort of persistent behavior um that that is that is present in whatever the locality that is being screened. So from a mission perspective, I don't know how feasible it is to stay put in in in one place and and then just thoroughly analyze what happens over time because you obviously want to see some presence that is again persistent over time.
