I think, you know, we we can synthesize these molecules, we can even make amino acids from lightning and I think maybe that made us think that the transit we will figure out the transition quickly too, but we we haven't. So there we're missing something key here, I think that why haven't we quite made this transition in the lab yet. Of course you can always argue that we're not as good as chemists as nature, but I feel like there are some parameters missing. So I guess my point is that what are we missing and what kind of experiments can we design um to to test this transition. that's that's really I think something that maybe we can if if anyone's interested, I'm very interested in brainstorming about this.",

I you know, I I'm an I'm an analytical chemist and I'm always thinking about how can we measure something? And when we talk about this kind of continuum or spectrum between life and non life, I mean, do we I'm trying to think of ways like ways to actually differentiate something in the middle versus something that's alive versus not alive. You know, something that's kind of on that path but maybe not there yet. And I think that's really difficult. I mean, you know, just I'm I'm a chemist and you know, thinking of when you when you throw in these really complex systems, right? the analytical tools that I'm familiar with, it's hard to actually capture that system interaction experimentally, right? You know, like so I'm I'm a mass spectrometrist for instance, right? And you know, people do mass spectrometry of cells and things all the time, right? And what they do is they, you know, they lice the cells and they look at the lipids, they look at the metabolites or they um, you know, they digest the proteins and the peptides and look at those, but you can't really see those molecular interactions through mass spectrometry, right? And so, you know, people have to do things like where they um tag molecules and look at like fluorescence microscopy or you know, things I mean, I'm I'm just my head is thinking about how do we how do we actually see something that's in in the middle. And I think that's really hard and maybe that's part of the reason why there's I mean there is kind of some gap I mean there's a lot of gap there. I like I I remember Greg I I heard you give a talk once about kind of your your work kind of thinking about that the space between that, right? And um yeah, I I I I feel like even even if we had a system present that was kind of in the in that space, could we really tell? I don't know I don't I don't know the answer to that question. You know, that that's that's kind of what's on my mind and I don't I don't mean to like transition the conversation away from where we are, but that that's what I'm thinking about, yeah.",

And then suddenly you just get two main peaks because it's kind of cutting off those other side reactions. And so sometimes it's clearly abiotic because you're just getting the small molecules or something, but a lot of times it it's not and the geochemical conditions can fine tune the distribution that you see. So it's less about product identification and more about distribution of organics, which has been talked about in astrobiology for a long time, but the abiotic distributions are highly variable and also pretty specific looking depending what you do.",
