And then I would like to ask you in the back of your mind if you would like to be the reporter to report out. I know Daniel has done it already, Meredith has done it already. So you only a couple of options around here. Um because you only get to do it once. And so why don't we just go through the room? 30 seconds kind of who you are, what you do and then we'll take a minute to just write down what you want, what what the questions are that you have and then we'll just go through the room and then we'll discuss. So basically, that's the setup and then it's all your floor, okay? So, um uh okay, why don't I start? So my name's Lisa Kaltenegger and I am working on modeling of rocky planet surface outgassing atmosphere, what we could see as astronomers when we look and I am very excited about any ideas that you have and hope I can give you some input, facilitate you, put you in the right direction.
