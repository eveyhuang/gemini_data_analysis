Could you get similar uh I guess trapping of that material if there's volcanism on one planet that can go to the other planets. I guess you'll need really extreme volcanoes if you have planet masses instead of moon masses. So you get them to leave.",

What happens is uh because the magnetic field is so strong and you have this plasma, um the material in the upper atmosphere becomes ionized and then it's lost because now it's just going with the the rotational velocity of the magnetic field. And so if you had one of your M dwarfs that was really magnetically active and you had your planets close enough that they were experiencing a significant magnetic field, then you could have this process without even needing too crazy of volcanism because it's just stripping off the upper atmosphere.",
