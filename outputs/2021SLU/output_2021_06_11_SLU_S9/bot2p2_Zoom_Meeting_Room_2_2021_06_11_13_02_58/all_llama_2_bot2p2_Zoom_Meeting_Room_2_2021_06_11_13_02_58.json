So you only a couple of options around here. Um because you only get to do it once. And so why don't we just go through the room? 30 seconds kind of who you are, what you do and then we'll take a minute to just write down what you want, what what the questions are that you have and then we'll just go through the room and then we'll discuss. So basically, that's the setup and then it's all your floor, okay? So, um uh okay, why don't I start? So my name's Lisa Kaltenegger and I am working on modeling of rocky planet surface outgassing atmosphere, what we could see as astronomers when we look and I am very excited about any ideas that you have and hope I can give you some input, facilitate you, put you in the right direction.

And so that's good news for life, but when we have this discussion, I think just one thing to throw in, it's perfectly fine to say, you know, you can sterilize a planet as long as when we're reporting out or when we think about it is when we talk about radiation, we talk about the surface.",

And so but I wanted to just bring this in because a lot of times the conversation will be different. And so um but I think this idea is about uh all these different parts together.

Um, very well done to metallicity of minus one, but if if Dan is telling me that the low metallicity is minus.4, I'm sure we're fine. Um, so M dwarfs are much, much, much more difficult because our understanding of molecular capacities is really terrible. Um, and in order to get around that it's really going to take an investment in laboratory astrophysics. Um, but our community doesn't tend to enjoy funding laboratory astrophysicists. So it's it's a little bit of a tricky um game to play. Um, the there's been a lot of um recent work done on M dwarf um uh characterization with machine learning. Um so I think that that we're going to see a big explosion in M dwarf characterization um with machine learning techniques. Oftentimes people find M dwarfs in pairs with white binary pairs with FGK stars and my group has done a lot of work really trying to show that okay that these these um white binary pairs are in fact really homogeneous so you can attach the chemistry of say the FGK star in the pair which is easy to the M dwarf which is not so easy and then that will allow us to actually do um build train sets and then do machine learning on the M. I think M are still there's still a lot to be desired there, but bulk metallicity or fine chemical compositions on M probably not so fine.",

I think there's a lot of work for rocky planets to connect connect the two and there it it's I think it's still sort of controversial whether whether there is a strong connection and one of the things that um in particular, right is this this work that tries to tie detailed chemical abundances of stars as a function of condensation temperature to the occurrence of terrestrial planets. Um and I don't know what the latest on this is. I always found it really fascinating. I know that it requires extremely precise abundances, which keeps a lot more about how feasible that is and you have to stick to stars that are really close to the sun in order to do differential uh abundances to do it well. But I always thought that you know, it's still sort of a controversial result, but it would be incredibly powerful, right? If you could just get really high resolution spectra, which we can to infer architectures or the presence of terrestrial planets that are not necessarily, you know, that are quite far away where we can actually detect them with transits and RVs. Um it it would be quite powerful. So I don't know what the latest on this is. I was always sort of fascinated by it, but um it's yeah, something I'm really thinking.",

And and so the question is in the architectures in which planets are being engulfed, do you expect to find a correlation between planet occurrence and the this signature of enhanced refractories simply because the planets might have already got engulfed. Um there's some new studies that are coming out that are showing that from a stellar astrophysics perspective that if you look at these um the the stars that have enhanced abundances, enhanced say uh carbon or enhanced iron abundances, that it scales with temperature. And that's exactly the signature you'd expect if it was planet engulfment and then the amount of uh you know, it's planet was engulfed into the atmosphere and it can got convected down, it would get diluted and so you should expect to see a a correlation with the the amount of difference and and temperature due to that convective envelope and people are starting to see that now. So um that's kind of I think where the field is at the moment in that regard, but it does require very precise abundance measurements and that can certainly be done. You you just need you don't necessarily need solar twins, but you need the two stars to be twins with each other, generally speaking.",

Um, there's some ideas about um as there's like a couple papers saying that really massive super earth planets if they have stagnant lids might not have volcanism at all because any melt you'd form would form at such high pressure because it's beneath this thick stagnant lid and it's a high gravity planet so the pressure gradient's really high so and the forming really high pressure there's a pressure crossover where melt is actually denser than solid and it wouldn't rise up and erupt anymore. But I also think that result's kind of like really heavily model and parameter dependent and so I wouldn't necessarily take that as like a really general, you know, big super earth planets are always going to have trouble outgassing. So yeah, I mean I would generally expect like most I would expect your typical rocky planet to have volcanism at least at some point in its history. Um, it might die out really on if it doesn't have a lot of heat producing elements and if it has a stagnant lid, but it's probably going to be at least some volcanism. And if you got a lot of tidal heating in some packed system then that's probably going to be volcanically active for a very long time.",

And there are some people who think you want M stars or there's no real reason to think life couldn't evolve subsurface or in the ocean. And I think um if you just apply this one criteria that people fight about, you get to completely different inferences where this galactic habitable zone is. But it would be really interesting to to kind of map the dependence on the on the different factors. Yeah. And see where things overlap. I don't know, it would just be really interesting to see like what you'd end up predicting in terms of where is good and where is bad depending upon what you've decided is important. And I think it would be really interesting is if you if you took priors, right? And see basically what the prior impact on your results are so that you're kind of very transparent about how your assumptions. And then if there is an overlap, right? And then you say, okay, with all these different priors, we found this region and all of them being good, so that's where we're going.

I think the papers that I'm aware of have like one prior that they assume and then they come to one conclusion what is what is fair. But it might be interesting. Exactly. And I think this is what I said initially, you know, the problem is like you can make this assuming you only have surface life. Right? And you assume a certain threshold for what it is gamma rays or whatever reaching the surface. Because if you put things in like ocean layers and stuff then at least UV is not bad anymore and so on and so forth. So I think an exploration uh I'm not aware of somebody who's actually explored this different thing like agnostically saying, okay, let's assume this, this is what we get. Let's assume this, this is what we get. People tend to have strong beliefs when they start this kind of modeling, I think mostly. But I don't know, somebody might have. There's a really good habitability overview in astronomy and astrophysics review, but it's a couple of years back and it talks about the galactic habitable zone. But again like in a in a more not modeling with these kind of parameters kind of thing. I think it would be interesting uh as a project if somebody wants to do it. Um But yeah, so I don't know is this another things that we have is um so we have the position in the galaxy. Uh stellar activity. Does somebody want to venture, you know, we only have a couple more minutes but now we can go like the crazy things out. Stellar activity, yes, no and there I just want to throw in this really new research from Cambridge that I don't know if you're aware of where they basically show that if you want to make life, if you have a certain UV flux, you actually make the uh reactions more efficient. They go from chemistry to RNA or to the precursor of RNAs, right? And so that kind of destroys or puts on its head this whole notion that you wanted quieter would be better. So maybe you need a certain level and especially if you go into the ocean like or under a layer of water then you need quite a level to actually get that level that you need under the layer of water.

I can look for it but it basically showed it's uh with uh Schalstek uh trying to find like your regions of life, redefining the regions of life and then they came to a region where if you want a minimum UV flux then you actually redefine this whole region of where you could have life. Because if the star doesn't have this minimum of UV flux getting filtered all the way to the ground then it might be more negative and again going all the way to is radiation good or bad for you.
