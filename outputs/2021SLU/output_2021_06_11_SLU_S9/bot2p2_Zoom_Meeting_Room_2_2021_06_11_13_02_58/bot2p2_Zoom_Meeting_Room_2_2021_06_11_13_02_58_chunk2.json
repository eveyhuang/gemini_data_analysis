Um, and this is sort of analogous to the Jupiter system which I work on where you have IO, it's putting out all this material because Jupiter's magnetic field is so strong that material is lost from IO's atmosphere, so it sort of makes IO's habitability worse, but then the material gets spread throughout the entire system deposited on the other moons and this this transport of material via magnetic field happens in all four of the giant planet systems.",
