And and so the question is in the architectures in which planets are being engulfed, do you expect to find a correlation between planet occurrence and the this signature of enhanced refractories simply because the planets might have already got engulfed. Um there's some new studies that are coming out that are showing that from a stellar astrophysics perspective that if you look at these um the the stars that have enhanced abundances, enhanced say uh carbon or enhanced iron abundances, that it scales with temperature. And that's exactly the signature you'd expect if it was planet engulfment and then the amount of uh you know, it's planet was engulfed into the atmosphere and it can got convected down, it would get diluted and so you should expect to see a a correlation with the the amount of difference and and temperature due to that convective envelope and people are starting to see that now. So um that's kind of I think where the field is at the moment in that regard, but it does require very precise abundance measurements and that can certainly be done.

But I also think that result's kind of like really heavily model and parameter dependent and so I wouldn't necessarily take that as like a really general, you know, big super earth planets are always going to have trouble outgassing. So yeah, I mean I would generally expect like most I would expect your typical rocky planet to have volcanism at least at some point in its history. Um, it might die out really on if it doesn't have a lot of heat producing elements and if it has a stagnant lid, but it's probably going to be at least some volcanism.

I don't know, it would just be really interesting to see like what you'd end up predicting in terms of where is good and where is bad depending upon what you've decided is important.

And I think this is what I said initially, you know, the problem is like you can make this assuming you only have surface life. Right? And you assume a certain threshold for what it is gamma rays or whatever reaching the surface. Because if you put things in like ocean layers and stuff then at least UV is not bad anymore and so on and so forth. So I think an exploration uh I'm not aware of somebody who's actually explored this different thing like agnostically saying, okay, let's assume this, this is what we get. Let's assume this, this is what we get. People tend to have strong beliefs when they start this kind of modeling, I think mostly. But I don't know, somebody might have. There's a really good habitability overview in astronomy and astrophysics review, but it's a couple of years back and it talks about the galactic habitable zone. But again like in a in a more not modeling with these kind of parameters kind of thing. I think it would be interesting uh as a project if somebody wants to do it. Um But yeah, so I don't know is this another things that we have is um so we have the position in the galaxy. Uh stellar activity. Does somebody want to venture, you know, we only have a couple more minutes but now we can go like the crazy things out. Stellar activity, yes, no and there I just want to throw in this really new research from Cambridge that I don't know if you're aware of where they basically show that if you want to make life, if you have a certain UV flux, you actually make the uh reactions more efficient. They go from chemistry to RNA or to the precursor of RNAs, right? And so that kind of destroys or puts on its head this whole notion that you wanted quieter would be better. So maybe you need a certain level and especially if you go into the ocean like or under a layer of water then you need quite a level to actually get that level that you need under the layer of water.
