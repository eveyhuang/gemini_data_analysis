So, uh, but it's an interesting question is like where do you have to position these giant planets, right, for it to be helpful or hurtful if there's something that. And then with Katrine's idea, that I really like this idea is like maybe you can position the giant planet at the right point where you get enough material like delivered, you know, so that even if you don't have all the nutrition. So I I really like uh these kind of ideas mixed together.",

So sterilizing the earth is actually not you would have to melt it down to a couple of kilometers to sterilize the earth. Sterilizing the surface of the earth is doable, but sterilizing the earth is not doable very easily. And so you need a huge impact to be able to do that. And so that's good news for life, but when we have this discussion, I think just one thing to throw in, it's perfectly fine to say, you know, you can sterilize a planet as long as when we're reporting out or when we think about it is when we talk about radiation, we talk about the surface.",

And so these paths of life could diverge and you could think about when you talk about the galactic habitable zone, you can think about it as a part where we can remotely detect life because it made it to the surface and thus actually changed the atmosphere considerably or if it never made it to the surface, does it still change the atmosphere of the surface so we can see it, right? And so but I wanted to just bring this in because a lot of times the conversation will be different. And so um but I think this idea is about uh all these different parts together. It sounds sounds great. So I will throw it to the one non astronomer to get us started on this. So Bradford, you saw that coming, right? So um why don't you just I don't know, throw out something that you want to talk about and we're just going to go at it.",

Um, maybe and actually also with giant planets like uh, you know, the Jupiter friend or foe idea from kind of current um senses of planets we have, you know, do we have enough information to start looking for trends like that in our current populations? Like I mean I guess right now it's really hard to see an actual Jupiter. Maybe it's impossible to see an actual Jupiter right now. But I'm curious, you know, like I'm curious about kind of testing some of these ideas of like, oh, if you form a Jupiter like planet like in our solar system, you know, is that going to lead to um, you know, more or less habitable rocky planets closer in and you know, like where we're at in the kind of current like exoplanet population statistics to start really saying, you know, making conclusive, you know, ideas about that.",

Which assumes that I've drawn a one to one like disc planet. Then you all of a sudden have this huge population of Neptunes and Uranus and Saturns and things that we, you know, can't otherwise detect, um, which would then imply, you know, like we do have giant planets.",

And test is actually within 100 parsecs, I would say or a bit less. So uh what are the constraints that you think we can actually put on these stars also considering a lot of them are M's.",

Um, very well done to metallicity of minus one, but if if Dan is telling me that the low metallicity is minus.4, I'm sure we're fine. Um, so M dwarfs are much, much, much more difficult because our understanding of molecular capacities is really terrible. Um, and in order to get around that it's really going to take an investment in laboratory astrophysics. Um, but our community doesn't tend to enjoy funding laboratory astrophysicists. So it's it's a little bit of a tricky um game to play. Um, the there's been a lot of um recent work done on M dwarf um uh characterization with machine learning. Um so I think that that we're going to see a big explosion in M dwarf characterization um with machine learning techniques. Oftentimes people find M dwarfs in pairs with white binary pairs with FGK stars and my group has done a lot of work really trying to show that okay that these these um white binary pairs are in fact really homogeneous so you can attach the chemistry of say the FGK star in the pair which is easy to the M dwarf which is not so easy and then that will allow us to actually do um build train sets and then do machine learning on the M. I think M are still there's still a lot to be desired there, but bulk metallicity or fine chemical compositions on M probably not so fine.",

It's um essentially everything gets washed out by the rotational signatures. Um, and so it becomes really challenging to do it incredibly young stars. And they're also obscure so then you have to go and keep Fred. So you and you also need the the um neutral transitions.
