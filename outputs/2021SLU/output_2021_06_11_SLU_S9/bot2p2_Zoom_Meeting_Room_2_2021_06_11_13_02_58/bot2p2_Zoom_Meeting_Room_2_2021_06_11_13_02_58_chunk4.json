Like like on one hand, I think almost every disc we look at now, there's just like rings and gaps all the way down. It seems to be completely ubiquitous that every disc is just like full of structure. But then I think there's more complexities to that. And like I've been really interested in, you know, differences between like A type stars and later type stars because the A type stars are where we find all these giant directly image planets and they seem to have some slightly different disc properties, like they hang on to gas for a lot longer and they have more massive discs and it seems like they might even have like different collisional properties and size distributions of bodies in their discs and so, you know, like the reach there would be to say, you know, I bet you could try and say something about like planet formation efficiency around different spectral type stars, you know, based on a variety of properties and my instinct is that there should be something there, but yeah, we haven't gotten there yet.",

Because they are so young and they're being born out of new gas. But it actually kind of depends on where you are in the galaxy. And so what I would encourage people to do maybe then is to look at instead of trying to deal with metallicities and and ages and so forth, which are extremely difficult, go to kinematics and ask yourself, okay, what is the kinematics of stars that have these discs in he say the inner galaxy versus the outer galaxy? Because we know there's a metal gradient in the disc.",

I think there's a lot of work for rocky planets to connect connect the two and there it it's I think it's still sort of controversial whether whether there is a strong connection and one of the things that um in particular, right is this this work that tries to tie detailed chemical abundances of stars as a function of condensation temperature to the occurrence of terrestrial planets. Um and I don't know what the latest on this is. I always found it really fascinating. I know that it requires extremely precise abundances, which keeps a lot more about how feasible that is and you have to stick to stars that are really close to the sun in order to do differential uh abundances to do it well. But I always thought that you know, it's still sort of a controversial result, but it would be incredibly powerful, right? If you could just get really high resolution spectra, which we can to infer architectures or the presence of terrestrial planets that are not necessarily, you know, that are quite far away where we can actually detect them with transits and RVs. Um it it would be quite powerful. So I don't know what the latest on this is. I was always sort of fascinated by it, but um it's yeah, something I'm really thinking.",

But I think those three elements are basically the only test of this uh assertion that is often made that the composition of the star should match the composition of the planet.",

And and so the question is in the architectures in which planets are being engulfed, do you expect to find a correlation between planet occurrence and the this signature of enhanced refractories simply because the planets might have already got engulfed. Um there's some new studies that are coming out that are showing that from a stellar astrophysics perspective that if you look at these um the the stars that have enhanced abundances, enhanced say uh carbon or enhanced iron abundances, that it scales with temperature. And that's exactly the signature you'd expect if it was planet engulfment and then the amount of uh you know, it's planet was engulfed into the atmosphere and it can got convected down, it would get diluted and so you should expect to see a a correlation with the the amount of difference and and temperature due to that convective envelope and people are starting to see that now. So um that's kind of I think where the field is at the moment in that regard, but it does require very precise abundance measurements and that can certainly be done. You you just need you don't necessarily need solar twins, but you need the two stars to be twins with each other, generally speaking.",
