            "transcript": "Um, I mean I would expect most rocky planets to have volcanism at least at some point in their lifetime, um, unless they're just born with like hardly any heat producing elements and are in, you know, some orbit configuration where they get like no tidal heating. Um, there's some ideas about um as there's like a couple papers saying that really massive super earth planets if they have stagnant lids might not have volcanism at all because any melt you'd form would form at such high pressure because it's beneath this thick stagnant lid and it's a high gravity planet so the pressure gradient's really high so and the forming really high pressure there's a pressure crossover where melt is actually denser than solid and it wouldn't rise up and erupt anymore. But I also think that result's kind of like really heavily model and parameter dependent and so I wouldn't necessarily take that as like a really general, you know, big super earth planets are always going to have trouble outgassing. So yeah, I mean I would generally expect like most I would expect your typical rocky planet to have volcanism at least at some point in its history. Um, it might die out really on if it doesn't have a lot of heat producing elements and if it has a stagnant lid, but it's probably going to be at least some volcanism. And if you got a lot of tidal heating in some packed system then that's probably going to be volcanically active for a very long time.",

These really, really hot worlds that have uh that should have an atmosphere that uh depends on what the mantle is made out of. It depends what outgasses because they should be molten. But uh we don't have enough information on those yet. We have the first spectra like Laura Kreidberg took one of the first spectra of one of these lava worlds, but I don't think we have good enough information to correlate it yet, but that would be great to to to a correlation on that. I don't know exoplanet observers. Does somebody want to chime in?",
