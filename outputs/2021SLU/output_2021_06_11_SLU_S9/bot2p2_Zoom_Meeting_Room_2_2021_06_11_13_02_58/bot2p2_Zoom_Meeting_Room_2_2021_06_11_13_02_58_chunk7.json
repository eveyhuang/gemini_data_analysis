Um then we talked a little bit about um the abundances of stars and um connecting that with the abundances of planets. We talked a little bit about this in a different order. Um so we talked about the condensation temperature uh work that's being done. We talked about um spectra of lava worlds, um white dwarf planet debris. Um and then we just recently talked about the galactic habitable zone. What do people think are the most important things that we should discuss with the group.",

Like it's around some type of star and it's so old and it has this metallicity and it's here in the galaxy and like you could define a number of factors and then just like do population statistics and look at a whole bunch of stars and say like these stars are most likely and these stars are least likely, like, you know, the the optimal list of where do we look for life based upon a whole bunch of these different external factors.",

They they kind of simply fall into two camps, I would say, and it would be nice to do this without falling in the two camps. There are some people who think you really don't want an M star. Yeah. And there are some people who think you want M stars or there's no real reason to think life couldn't evolve subsurface or in the ocean. And I think um if you just apply this one criteria that people fight about, you get to completely different inferences where this galactic habitable zone is. But it would be really interesting to to kind of map the dependence on the on the different factors. Yeah. And see where things overlap. I don't know, it would just be really interesting to see like what you'd end up predicting in terms of where is good and where is bad depending upon what you've decided is important. And I think it would be really interesting is if you if you took priors, right? And see basically what the prior impact on your results are so that you're kind of very transparent about how your assumptions. And then if there is an overlap, right? And then you say, okay, with all these different priors, we found this region and all of them being good, so that's where we're going. It might actually end up being around the sun, you know, being this ring around the sun that people are most conservatively interested in.",

            "transcript": "But but I don't think they've done like a a kind of analysis with different priors. I think the papers that I'm aware of have like one prior that they assume and then they come to one conclusion what is what is fair. But it might be interesting. Exactly. And I think this is what I said initially, you know, the problem is like you can make this assuming you only have surface life. Right? And you assume a certain threshold for what it is gamma rays or whatever reaching the surface. Because if you put things in like ocean layers and stuff then at least UV is not bad anymore and so on and so forth. So I think an exploration uh I'm not aware of somebody who's actually explored this different thing like agnostically saying, okay, let's assume this, this is what we get. Let's assume this, this is what we get. People tend to have strong beliefs when they start this kind of modeling, I think mostly. But I don't know, somebody might have. There's a really good habitability overview in astronomy and astrophysics review, but it's a couple of years back and it talks about the galactic habitable zone. But again like in a in a more not modeling with these kind of parameters kind of thing. I think it would be interesting uh as a project if somebody wants to do it. Um But yeah, so I don't know is this another things that we have is um so we have the position in the galaxy. Uh stellar activity. Does somebody want to venture, you know, we only have a couple more minutes but now we can go like the crazy things out. Stellar activity, yes, no and there I just want to throw in this really new research from Cambridge that I don't know if you're aware of where they basically show that if you want to make life, if you have a certain UV flux, you actually make the uh reactions more efficient. They go from chemistry to RNA or to the precursor of RNAs, right? And so that kind of destroys or puts on its head this whole notion that you wanted quieter would be better. So maybe you need a certain level and especially if you go into the ocean like or under a layer of water then you need quite a level to actually get that level that you need under the layer of water. So I don't know, activity bad, good.",

There is uh the the the the other one for exoplanets is out of Cambridge University and Demetrius is one of the co-authors. I can look for it but it basically showed it's uh with uh Schalstek uh trying to find like your regions of life, redefining the regions of life and then they came to a region where if you want a minimum UV flux then you actually redefine this whole region of where you could have life. Because if the star doesn't have this minimum of UV flux getting filtered all the way to the ground then it might be more negative and again going all the way to is radiation good or bad for you. Depends a little what you think what the origins of life needs, sorry.",
