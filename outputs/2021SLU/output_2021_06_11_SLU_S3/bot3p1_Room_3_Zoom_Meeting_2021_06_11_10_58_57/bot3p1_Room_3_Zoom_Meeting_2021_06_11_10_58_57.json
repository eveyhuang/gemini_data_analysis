I know you're you're getting sort of to the business side of all of this. You're all frantic, not frantically, but creatively thinking about who you want to pair or triple with as you think about your proposals and probably you'd rather almost skip this step and find your two people to start thinking about brainstorming about your proposal. So I'm trying to think of some way to use this space to have a good general discussion and report out as we're supposed to do, but also let you start continue to formulate in your minds what you want to do for your proposal. Um, so I want you to do most of the talking, not me. I think it's good to do the introduction because you're still sort of looking for people to partner with. So you need to know what everyone does. Some of you know each other, some of you don't.",
