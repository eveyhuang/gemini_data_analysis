I think if that's our standard, then we know that that happened pretty early in Earth's sort of life history. So three so maximum 1 billion years.",

            "transcript": "Well, so you know the addition of genomic perspectives have completely changed the field for those of us who think about our sciences when I um about Earth, when I first started doing this, it was really just based on geochemistry and the and the evidence for the earliest oxygenesis was described to the biomarkers at 2.7 billion years ago. Um and those as I said yesterday, they have since been shown to be uh contamination. We actually don't have a good handle at all when about when biological production of oxygen began based on just records, uh we put it at about 3 billion years ago and it's a very convoluted argument based on inferred presence of oxygen in the surface ocean and its effect on metal isotopes. It's a very hard question to ask. Methanogenesis, I guess would be pushed back genomically to about 4 billion years ago, something like that roughly. Um but the evidence for methane, one comes from the models that you probably need methane to keep the earth warm, but that's very indirect. The evidence for it in light carbon isotopes, uh you know, these are actually methanotrophy, those are much younger records. Um you can come at it for you know, the absence of sulfate favors methane production and preservation, but that's not a direct measure of it. So we don't actually really know that much even about the methane and detectability of the methane cycle on our own planet. Um but maybe it was a half a billion years after the beginning of the planet. Um so if biological production at at 4 billion years ago. Um so you know, so where does that leave us? Um I I guess with with other planets. Um are these critical questions? This idea that I posed yesterday that it's important to think about a planet's long history and whether it went through a kind of evolution in a planetary system sense that might have fostered the beginnings of life. Is that a critical question when you're choosing a target, for example?",

            "timestamp": "04:50-07:07",
            "transcript": "So I I um this this question of detectability is is extremely important especially in terms of time scale. Um, you know, and targets. So um, the reality is that our telescopes are just not powerful enough to see uh it's very difficult to see um exoplanet atmospheres and JWST will only get to hand, you know, maybe see a handful, maybe a little bit more. And so um, you know, going on the, you know, I think it's really important that the biologist tell the astronomers what are the most important bio signatures so that we can then better target um the right type of stars, um, and ages of stars. So the answer to um, uh Stilianos, I did not pronounce that correctly, so I apologize. Um, his question is is, you know, it's a very difficult question actually. In measuring ages of individual stars in in the night sky is actually extremely challenging to do. Um, Earth is about, you know, the sun is about 4 and a half billion years, but there have been planets found around 100 million year old stars and the only reason why we know that they're 100 million years old is because they're moving in a stream of stars where we can actually age date that collection of stars to a border 100 million years old. that's in the stream, you know, a paper that we published um not that long ago, a couple months ago. And so I think that, you know, time skills are very important part of this and that, you know, you don't you probably don't want to go and look for bio signatures on planets around uh, you know, very massive, relatively massive two or three times the solar mass because they're not going to live for very. They're going to live for tens of millions or maybe hundreds of millions of years. And so if life takes more than that time scale to to actually emerge then and actually go from being small cellular to to much more complex, then you're going to need to look around stars that are much smaller in order for life to exist. You know, the sun for example will will expand in about 5 billion years. So we have plenty of time uh to get off the planet. But um before that happens, but that's going to happen in 5 million year time scale for a very massive star. So, um we have to be I think these this idea of like what bio signatures are important and what is the time scale for those bio signatures to become relevant is actually an incredibly important question from the astrophysicist.",

But then on the other end of the spectrum, we have M stars which are incredibly long lived, but from what I understand because they're so close, they're going to be tidally locked and so you may end up with only a small ring of habitability around the edges.",
