Um and so like a lot of the stars that we know have these discs and planet formation environments and planets like we have really bad ages for because we just haven't been able to age them. So almost all of them that do have ages are because like Keith said they're in these like moving groups and um so we have a pretty rough time scale on it, but there's an interesting thing in that like as we look at these discs, it's actually shoving the planet formation time scale shorter and shorter and shorter and that we see systems where we think there are planets at ages that are, you know, maybe a million years old or something and you have fully formed planets. So that's really a big change in how we think of the planet formation time scale by accelerating it so close to the age of the star then you have planets formed really early. Um and a lot longer time scale than, you know, to do other things once you have a planet.",

So those are some really important points and maybe I can plant a seed if it's fruitful or not. Um you can decide the M star bias in terms of abundance and in terms of of of skewing towards detectability. They're you know, there's going to be a lot of talk about M stars and what we do with them especially in terms of target selection. And the other thing is about title locking whether that I'm curious to know whether you think that precludes a biosphere and and if not why. Um what would life on a tidally locked planet be like and what are the models for sustaining that. I think you're muted Keith. Were you trying to speak? Sorry. Nope, okay.",

Um you know, be it like, okay, you need um you need heat to make to ensure that the reactions go really fast, but then you you really need to be secluded from the uh from any um uh radiation input or something and you're not facing the star so that helps. Um anyway, so you you you you might have this um I'm I'm thinking maybe um just like you wet dry cycles where the what helps and the dry helps, right?

Um and and I guess I guess the width of the interface would be defined by by the mixing rate uh which sounds to me you said there's not going to be uh uh convection of the atmosphere uh but I guess diffusion would then be the mixing mechanism primarily.
