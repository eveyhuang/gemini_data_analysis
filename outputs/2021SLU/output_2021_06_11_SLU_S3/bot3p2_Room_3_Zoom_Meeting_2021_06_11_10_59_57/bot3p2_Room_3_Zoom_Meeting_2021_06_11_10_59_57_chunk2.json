I try and understand how the chemistry of those discs becomes the chemistry of planets. I try and understand the dynamics of how planets and discs interact, whether that means for like impacts and kicking up um collisions in discs. And then I'm also currently really interested in stars and stellar activity. So stars throughout these bursts of radiation that go out and, you know, impact the planets and their atmospheres and their life and the discs. And so I'm really um trying to better understand that and then draw a connection to understand what that would do to say an organism hanging out on the surface of an exoplanet that gets hit by this burst of radiation.",

Um I mainly use the tools of bioinformatics to understand microbial evolution. So in the world of astrobiology it's kind of two pronged. One side is thinking about microbial evolution in deep sea hydrothermal vents. So I think a lot about the origin early evolution of life. And then increasingly lately I have been um thinking applying these tools to thinking about microbial um microbial metabolism in deep time. So I've been doing a lot of projects in collaboration with geochemists to think about how microbial evolution and metabolism have changed biogeochemical cycles and interacted with them um in earth through deep time.",

            "transcript": "Um so so as our our group yesterday it was the same person who took the notes and and also then did the reporting when we went back into single group and um and then you know the gig. You have to produce that little simple document with bulleted points. Um great. Okay, well thanks. So I I thought again, I don't really want to say very much. That's how these things are designed, but I thought that I it would help if I sort of tried to kick it off a little bit and you probably have gathered already. I'm I'm mostly an earth centric scientist but increasingly thinking about our history in ways that it has utility in exploring for life beyond. Uh exoplanets in particular but increasingly Mars and and I one of my deepest passions but one that I've not pursued at all are are icy satellites. I'm so excited about those. And they all um, you know, present I think analogies aspects that make earth really useful, but in other ways they're really different. So I'll give you one example. I think of origins of life on an icy satellite. Um the range of possibilities would be really different than what you would have on earth. Um so I as I said yesterday, I'm very interested in not just trying to find life, but using that through a filter, viewing that through a filter of how that life began and how that plays out in different places. So all that being said, what would be interesting for me and I think for the rest of you is to maybe start with an earth centric question and then get spacey beyond that and to talk a little bit about maybe when each of you thinks that earth developed a robust biosphere and by robust we can define what that means. I would love to hear what you think about robust. To me that means something that's sustainable. We know that we've had oceans almost all of our history so we maintained our habitability. there are vast questions about how we maintained our nutrient availability and that's a central question for any of these searches that we engage in. Um but let's assume for the sake of argument that we've had persistent oceans since 43, 4.3 billion years ago on earth um and that we must have had nutrients presumably that were available through varying ways as plate tectonics kicked in and the absence of that in a planet that may have been a water world that later became one with continents. Um so, you know, as part of PCE3, I'm discovering that there's there's there's very little consensus about how all of this started. Uh even less consensus than I imagined. Um to the degree that you know, how you use our planet's geological history to validate your model or not is all over the place, right? Whether you need continents or emergent continents or not, whether you can do it at a hydrothermal vents under a vast ocean. Um so these are all really interesting to me because we're trying to converge different perspectives, but it's hard to do that when everyone's coming from very different directions. So, I would love to hear what what you all think about our own history and how it maintained developed and maintained the robustness, IE something that could also not only persist but evolve and when perhaps our biosphere was detectable were you to be looking at it from a great distance. And just chime in, put your hand up and I'll try and make sure that um that all the hands that are up are selected um and I may also just call on people because I would love to get everyone involved.",

Um um in order to maintain sustain in order to establish sustainability, you mentioned cycles. I think that's the keyword. Uh nutrient cycles or or even better elemental cycles. If if you think about the nitrogen cycle goes through these different redox states, only some of which are really accessible to life. Um the way I think about it is almost as a form of inevitability. So if a cycle were not to be complete because for example life only evolved to perform some of the redox transformations, uh but then you have an accumulation of the of the of a product at the dead end and it doesn't come back to reserve life, for example nitrogen cycle for for primary productivity, you would have an accumulation of um energy uh uh in some sense. You you you'd probably accumulate some sort of redox disequilibrium especially if you have photosynthesis going on. Um and there's broad there's there's broad idea in the microbial world that microbes eventually will evolve a way to use that energy. There is there's holes in that theory and counter examples.",

And um honestly the way I see it and um I don't think that that's necessarily the most productive way to look at it because I don't think everything necessarily had to happen in one place. I think you could have, you know, built up precursors and had them transported somewhere else. Um and in terms of what you need for it to take off, you know, initially we started talking about continents. You know, I'm not so sure you need a continent. I think that you probably do need a dry place because I think that um at least when I think about it, I feel like you do need to invoke some of these wet dry cycles, but it could be a much smaller body of dry land and one of the conversations yesterday described it as, you know, give me a kitchen table and maybe we can work with that as long as it's not getting eroded too fast.",
