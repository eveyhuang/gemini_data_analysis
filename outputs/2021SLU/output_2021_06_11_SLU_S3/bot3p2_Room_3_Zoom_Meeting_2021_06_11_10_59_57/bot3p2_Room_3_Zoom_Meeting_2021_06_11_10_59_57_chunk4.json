Um is it is it if you're, you know, if you're devoted to that view, do you imagine that life could start on an icy moon and should we be investing money um in astrobiology looking at icy moons?",

It could just be uh ice, uh or even clathrates coming and going, right? So I want to know is that actually a thing that would do this chemical evolution.",

I think that the kind of thing you get with utectics and the concentration, you know, it presents its own set of challenges and that you don't have the same energy to do chemistry that you would otherwise, but you do get the concentration effect and so Mark's point about the minerals and uh that can be really beneficial too. And I think there's some features that come out of this, like the minerals can promote liposome formation, ice can encourage division of liposomes.

So let me just run that from sort of soup to nuts if I could. Imagine a hydrothermal system on the sea floor of an icy moon and it's it's spewing out precursor molecules and also energy sources such as hydrogen. Um and and this material becomes incorporated in the underside of an icy cap. Um and then you also have oxidation at the surface so you're setting up redox gradients that you might want to have as well and then through ice sheet dynamics it's feasible to imagine bringing all of this stuff together within the ice itself where you might have the right water activity to do what's necessary and otherwise minimizing the dilution effect.",

And then there is this giant bridge that gets us to metabolisms, which is really what you need for detectability. And what I find within the community PCE3 for example is sort of like everything we do stops before you get to metabolisms and then that becomes part of another RCN, which is, you know, these groups are meant to interact in ways that will try and narrow those bridges. But it is an interesting thing to think about and and um so what is let's go back to this detectability issue. I again, most of you are not earth scientists, but do you have any sense, have you brought any prejudices or informed views on when you think earth became a detectable biosphere um by whatever measure, whether you could do an institute sample or analysis or looking at our atmosphere, Mark?",
