            "transcript": "if you're talking about techno signatures then I'm gonna let Tim speak. But if you're talk if you're talking about like kind of the in between, I recently led a mission concept study uh designing um search for life missions at Enceladus and we were looking for um the chemical signatures like you said because those are so well motivated by the Cassini data like there are complex organics in in the plume of Enceladus. The question is what are they? So looking for amino acids and lipids, um looking for uh something that could serve the role as DNA with something like a nanopore sequencer and looking for cell morphologies but also something um in conjunction with that maybe fluorescence or motility. Those were kind of the strategies that we employed but there are many more one could consider.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I mean techno signatures there's a wide range and there's a pretty big community that cares about that includes things like like gases in the atmosphere that would by our understanding not have a biological source. There are light relationships, there are many things, radio signals. Um, but there are also other classes of things like the red edge which can be very strongly related to terrestrial biomass um on our planet, grasses and trees and the like vegetation on land areas, uh algae in the ocean. So there are pigment classes as well. Many of the much of the focus has been on bacterial pigments in the surface ocean as being potentially detectable. That's a challenging field but it's certainly a possibility. There would be other things living in the ocean that might be detectable in a pigment sense. Look at chlorophyll on our own planet. Um, so a lot of it is is prokaryotic uh and impacts on atmospheric gases but it's not exclusively that. Um, if would someone else like to say something we have actually only about five minutes and I it's this would be the time where I would ask Jen if you have uh in an organized sense things that you want to be able to report out.",

Um, when I don't know if I can actually I could share my screen I guess, but um, well you can also see what I'm doing if you go into the spreadsheet but what um, when did life uh when did Earth develop a robust and detectable biosphere was kind of the question that Tim originally posed. Um, and where did life proliferate I said, um, uh we talked about wet dry cycles, um, and other places that they can occur besides the planetary surface like in the subsurface and ices. We talked um about gradients on tidally locked planets. Uh, and oops. Um, we talked oops, I just keep getting moved to another thing here. Oh, wait. Sorry. Okay, and then we talked what were the major external events that limited um, uh life's uh robustness I guess or or uh life's uh distribution. How how should we say that? And may constrain the timing of life. There was debate about the late heavy bombardment and was there even such a thing? Um, I'd love to hear though some other people kind of summarize their main points because I might be being biased here.",
