Um, I was wondering if if the planetary folks could um, give give us more information about kind of the timeline of major meteoritic impacts on other on exopla or throughout the universe, I guess. Like, um, you know, we were talking about that there, you know, on earth, we think obviously there were at least more of them early on, right? Even if there wasn't a late heavy bombardment, there would still have been a lot of impacts, right? That's my understanding. And the implications thereof. But like on if if um, I think it was, I'm sorry, I forget if it was Meredith or Shannon or someone else who was saying that um, other um, systems have a lot more like junk in them. That's not how you put it better than that. But a lot more um, impactors. So, you know, can you talk a bit more about about that? About um, would this would there be heavier bigger impactors just throughout the time scale of planet of ex some exoplanets.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, um, I I like the junk phrasing. That's a good one. Um, I I think there's there's lots of like different directions to take that in terms of, you know, what we can say and what we can't say. Um, so in the history of our solar system, right? The outer planets seem really important because, you know, for one, this kind of late heavy bombardment comes out of these models of our early solar system dynamics where you kind of have the outer planets start migrating around a little bit. And as they migrate around a little bit, they interact gravitationally and they move around even more and in the process of doing that, they actually kick up a lot of the like remnant what we call planetesimals, which is just asteroids and comets. Things that got big during planet formation but didn't get planet sized. And so that movement of the outer planets starts to kick them up and they come flying into the inner solar system. And so that produces this kind of, you know, rush of impactors. But on the other hand, it seems like Jupiter maybe actually blocked a bunch. Like it could have been a lot worse because Jupiter is so big that it kind of like separated the inner part of the planet forming disc from the outer part of the planet forming disc and so, you know, Jupiter is like a big traffic guard kind of keeping all the comments from coming in and hitting us, right?",

            "transcript": "So so the outer planets are like some key elements there in terms of kicking things up but also keeping the levels down. Um, and so there's a few like takeaways from that, right? So like these exoplanet systems have a lot more remnant stuff. So they probably started with more massive discs in the first place and so they just have a lot more things to like come flying around. Um, in general, discs like deplete in mass slowly, right? And we can sort of roughly age systems and then try and get masses and try and track like what the mass of stuff is that can come and it does like slowly damp off after hundreds of millions of years to billions of years.",

Um, and uh I I think I think a lot of people would argue that some of at least some of them were probably caused due to internal dynamics of the biosphere rather than some major geological event. Uh, the biosphere itself can be a very chaotic system in some sense and so you can have these sort of fluctua intense fluctuations with cascades of extinction because some sort of keystone species uh went extinct for some reason or or because some some major change happened in the biosphere. Um, so I would see mass extinctions as not sort of a probation periods of life but perhaps just something life just likes to do occasionally.",
