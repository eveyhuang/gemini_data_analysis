            "transcript": "that life probably began before the late heavy bombardment and somehow made it through the late heavy bombardment, which suggests that it was robust enough to somehow make it through that. Now whether it's because life got lucky or if it's because the biosphere at that point was robust enough to survive a late heavy bombardment, I don't know. Um, but I think that's a really interesting question. It does reveal my biases where I think the deep sea would have been really important. Um, and so there could have been some sort of robust biosphere in the deep sea along the subsurface. Um, and then, you know, your other question was at what point would it have been detectable and I think that, you know, at that point it would have had to become robust enough to spread throughout the oceans to produce enough gases that has enough flux to be detectable. But I don't know, it's just an interesting question. I think the late heavy bombardment kind of plays an interesting role there.",

            "transcript": "Uh Meredith, I see your hand, but let me just follow up on that point. So again as somebody who's coming from the outside into this field, especially origins of life, there's been a lot of revisitation to the notion of the late heavy bombardment by revisiting lunar crater chronologies. Um, and and models as well. Simone's Mark's view on this. So he puts a spike at at 4.1, but in essence doesn't think there was a late heavy bombardment. And there's suggestions of that based on the revisits of lunar chronologies as well. So I maybe can we before I get to Shannon and Meredith could for those of you who actually do that sort of thing for a living, is are any of you do any of you have strong feelings on the late heavy bombardment? Whether the potentially sterilizing event or or maybe it was a facilitator in ways that I talked about yesterday. What's your what's your view of the LHB?",

            "transcript": "Um, you sort of said exactly what I was going to try and say in response to Rika because um, I I work on planetary system formation and trying to understand and look at these discs where something like late heavy bombardment would be actually happening now. Um, because we can see that around other planetary systems, right? So we can go and we can image these discs that are, you know, tens of millions to hundreds of millions to billions of years old and we can actually see the dynamics of them um in real time. And so um, the different look at late heavy bombardment instead of just looking at the crater counts but trying to understand like the dynamics of planetary systems and discs. Um, and it's complicated and tricky. Um, there's a few things that I think are interesting and of note here and that, you know, our solar system actually has a lot less excess stuff hanging around in it than the typical exoplanetary system. Um, so um, we have a disc that remains, which is the Kyper belt and the asteroid belt and it's pretty mass poor and by mass poor I mean like orders of magnitude less comets and asteroids than, you know, the typical exoplanetary system that we look at. Um, so it's sort of an interesting case to consider in terms of like, you know, whether we had a late heavy bombardment, but when we look at exoplanetary systems, we're looking at a completely different dynamic. There's just so much more stuff, which means more collisions, which means more dynamics, which means more things getting thrown around. Um, and I I'm really always struck from an astrophysical perspective by kind of how things like this can both be necessary but also incredibly harmful, right? Like this is a lot of things that I work on, you know, like discs in terms of bringing water to the planet in the first place, but then, you know, too many impacts and you start killing things or stellar flares might be necessary to give you UV, but maybe that's too much and you start destroying things. And so my question then has always been like, you know, I can study these from astrophysical phenomenon and I can come up with rates and predictions and dynamics and things like that, but then, you know, how robust is life actually? Because I don't have a good sense for that. Like can life handle an increase of some amount or not, right? And and that's I'm really curious to hear from biologists like, you know, how robust is life in actuality to these sorts of transient events.",

You know, when we look at models of primitive cells, you know, the we can operate just simple fatty acids and those will form liposomes and we can do cell like things with them. Um, and those can get more robust as you go to longer chain lengths, like pretty much the minimum length you need is about 10 carbons. Uh, once you get to 18 carbons like an oleic acid membrane, they get a lot more robust. But none of those can hold a pH gradient and they tend to be a little bit leaky. Um, once you start substituting in and having like mixed membranes with things that are like modern components. So a modern cell membrane would have two fatty acids linked to a molecule of glycerin and a phosphate and having those two fatty acids makes a much more robust membrane and so the more of that modern component that you have in there, the less leaky they get and also once you get to a fully modern cell membrane made of that component alone, uh, they can do things things like start to hold a pH gradient. And I think that'll enable some of the stuff like what Stellian was talking about at the beginning with um, you know, building up redox components and things like that because that lets you have this sort of disequilibrium.",
