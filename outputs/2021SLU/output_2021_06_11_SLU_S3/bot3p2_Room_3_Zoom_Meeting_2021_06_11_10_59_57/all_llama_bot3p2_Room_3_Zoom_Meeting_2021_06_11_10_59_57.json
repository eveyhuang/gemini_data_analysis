How and when does does did life establish a biosphere? All origins are local by definition. How does primordial biology diversify to a point where it is robust and detectable on a planetary scale? Microbial evolution on the early earth, how did microbes spread across the early earth and affect biogeochemical cycling, evolution? How have successive waves of evolutionary innovation altered the structure and function of our planet? How long does it take our prebiotic chemistry to become biochemistry? Are there ways of bounding this problem on earth? Does the length of evolutionary time necessary for life to influence a planet's atmosphere depend on the planet's properties such as the amount of liquid water present on the surface, the thickness of the planet's atmosphere, etcetera. Okay, well now we're done, we're out of our time. So it's good to see you all. So, so that's a pretty tall order and we can unpack that a little bit.

You have to produce that little simple document with bulleted points. Um great. Okay, well thanks. So I I thought again, I don't really want to say very much. That's how these things are designed, but I thought that I it would help if I sort of tried to kick it off a little bit and you probably have gathered already. I'm I'm mostly an earth centric scientist but increasingly thinking about our history in ways that it has utility in exploring for life beyond. Uh exoplanets in particular but increasingly Mars and and I one of my deepest passions but one that I've not pursued at all are are icy satellites. I'm so excited about those. And they all um, you know, present I think analogies aspects that make earth really useful, but in other ways they're really different. So I'll give you one example. I think of origins of life on an icy satellite. Um the range of possibilities would be really different than what you would have on earth. Um so I as I said yesterday, I'm very interested in not just trying to find life, but using that through a filter, viewing that through a filter of how that life began and how that plays out in different places. So all that being said, what would be interesting for me and I think for the rest of you is to maybe start with an earth centric question and then get spacey beyond that and to talk a little bit about maybe when each of you thinks that earth developed a robust biosphere and by robust we can define what that means. I would love to hear what you think about robust. To me that means something that's sustainable. We know that we've had oceans almost all of our history so we maintained our habitability. there are vast questions about how we maintained our nutrient availability and that's a central question for any of these searches that we engage in. Um but let's assume for the sake of argument that we've had persistent oceans since 43, 4.3 billion years ago on earth um and that we must have had nutrients presumably that were available through varying ways as plate tectonics kicked in and the absence of that in a planet that may have been a water world that later became one with continents. Um so, you know, as part of PCE3, I'm discovering that there's there's there's very little consensus about how all of this started. Uh even less consensus than I imagined. Um to the degree that you know, how you use our planet's geological history to validate your model or not is all over the place, right? Whether you need continents or emergent continents or not, whether you can do it at a hydrothermal vents under a vast ocean. Um so these are all really interesting to me because we're trying to converge different perspectives, but it's hard to do that when everyone's coming from very different directions. So, I would love to hear what what you all think about our own history and how it maintained developed and maintained the robustness, IE something that could also not only persist but evolve and when perhaps our biosphere was detectable were you to be looking at it from a great distance. And just chime in, put your hand up and I'll try and make sure that um that all the hands that are up are selected um and I may also just call on people because I would love to get everyone involved.",

Um um in order to maintain sustain in order to establish sustainability, you mentioned cycles. I think that's the keyword. Uh nutrient cycles or or even better elemental cycles. If if you think about the nitrogen cycle goes through these different redox states, only some of which are really accessible to life. Um the way I think about it is almost as a form of inevitability. So if a cycle were not to be complete because for example life only evolved to perform some of the redox transformations, uh but then you have an accumulation of the of the of a product at the dead end and it doesn't come back to reserve life, for example nitrogen cycle for for primary productivity, you would have an accumulation of um energy uh uh in some sense. You you you'd probably accumulate some sort of redox disequilibrium especially if you have photosynthesis going on. Um and there's broad there's there's broad idea in the microbial world that microbes eventually will evolve a way to use that energy. There is there's holes in that theory and counter examples.",

And um honestly the way I see it and um I don't think that that's necessarily the most productive way to look at it because I don't think everything necessarily had to happen in one place.

Um, but I think that's a really interesting question. It does reveal my biases where I think the deep sea would have been really important. Um, and so there could have been some sort of robust biosphere in the deep sea along the subsurface. Um, and then, you know, your other question was at what point would it have been detectable and I think that, you know, at that point it would have had to become robust enough to spread throughout the oceans to produce enough gases that has enough flux to be detectable.

So again as somebody who's coming from the outside into this field, especially origins of life, there's been a lot of revisitation to the notion of the late heavy bombardment by revisiting lunar crater chronologies. Um, and and models as well. Simone's Mark's view on this. So he puts a spike at at 4.1, but in essence doesn't think there was a late heavy bombardment. And there's suggestions of that based on the revisits of lunar chronologies as well. So I maybe can we before I get to Shannon and Meredith could for those of you who actually do that sort of thing for a living, is are any of you do any of you have strong feelings on the late heavy bombardment? Whether the potentially sterilizing event or or maybe it was a facilitator in ways that I talked about yesterday. What's your what's your view of the LHB?",

Um, because we can see that around other planetary systems, right? So we can go and we can image these discs that are, you know, tens of millions to hundreds of millions to billions of years old and we can actually see the dynamics of them um in real time. And so um, the different look at late heavy bombardment instead of just looking at the crater counts but trying to understand like the dynamics of planetary systems and discs. Um, and it's complicated and tricky. Um, there's a few things that I think are interesting and of note here and that, you know, our solar system actually has a lot less excess stuff hanging around in it than the typical exoplanetary system. Um, so um, we have a disc that remains, which is the Kyper belt and the asteroid belt and it's pretty mass poor and by mass poor I mean like orders of magnitude less comets and asteroids than, you know, the typical exoplanetary system that we look at. Um, so it's sort of an interesting case to consider in terms of like, you know, whether we had a late heavy bombardment, but when we look at exoplanetary systems, we're looking at a completely different dynamic. There's just so much more stuff, which means more collisions, which means more dynamics, which means more things getting thrown around. Um, and I I'm really always struck from an astrophysical perspective by kind of how things like this can both be necessary but also incredibly harmful, right? Like this is a lot of things that I work on, you know, like discs in terms of bringing water to the planet in the first place, but then, you know, too many impacts and you start killing things or stellar flares might be necessary to give you UV, but maybe that's too much and you start destroying things. And so my question then has always been like, you know, I can study these from astrophysical phenomenon and I can come up with rates and predictions and dynamics and things like that, but then, you know, how robust is life actually? Because I don't have a good sense for that. Like can life handle an increase of some amount or not, right? And and that's I'm really curious to hear from biologists like, you know, how robust is life in actuality to these sorts of transient events.",

You know, when we look at models of primitive cells, you know, the we can operate just simple fatty acids and those will form liposomes and we can do cell like things with them. Um, and those can get more robust as you go to longer chain lengths, like pretty much the minimum length you need is about 10 carbons. Uh, once you get to 18 carbons like an oleic acid membrane, they get a lot more robust. But none of those can hold a pH gradient and they tend to be a little bit leaky. Um, once you start substituting in and having like mixed membranes with things that are like modern components. So a modern cell membrane would have two fatty acids linked to a molecule of glycerin and a phosphate and having those two fatty acids makes a much more robust membrane and so the more of that modern component that you have in there, the less leaky they get and also once you get to a fully modern cell membrane made of that component alone, uh, they can do things things like start to hold a pH gradient. And I think that'll enable some of the stuff like what Stellian was talking about at the beginning with um, you know, building up redox components and things like that because that lets you have this sort of disequilibrium.",

Imagine a hydrothermal system on the sea floor of an icy moon and it's it's spewing out precursor molecules and also energy sources such as hydrogen. Um and and this material becomes incorporated in the underside of an icy cap. Um and then you also have oxidation at the surface so you're setting up redox gradients that you might want to have as well and then through ice sheet dynamics it's feasible to imagine bringing all of this stuff together within the ice itself where you might have the right water activity to do what's necessary and otherwise minimizing the dilution effect.",

And then there is this giant bridge that gets us to metabolisms, which is really what you need for detectability. And what I find within the community PCE3 for example is sort of like everything we do stops before you get to metabolisms and then that becomes part of another RCN, which is, you know, these groups are meant to interact in ways that will try and narrow those bridges. But it is an interesting thing to think about and and um so what is let's go back to this detectability issue. I again, most of you are not earth scientists, but do you have any sense, have you brought any prejudices or informed views on when you think earth became a detectable biosphere um by whatever measure, whether you could do an institute sample or analysis or looking at our atmosphere, Mark?",

        "transcript": "Well, so you know the addition of genomic perspectives have completely changed the field for those of us who think about our sciences when I um about Earth, when I first started doing this, it was really just based on geochemistry and the and the evidence for the earliest oxygenesis was described to the biomarkers at 2.7 billion years ago. Um and those as I said yesterday, they have since been shown to be uh contamination. We actually don't have a good handle at all when about when biological production of oxygen began based on just records, uh we put it at about 3 billion years ago and it's a very convoluted argument based on inferred presence of oxygen in the surface ocean and its effect on metal isotopes. It's a very hard question to ask. Methanogenesis, I guess would be pushed back genomically to about 4 billion years ago, something like that roughly. Um but the evidence for methane, one comes from the models that you probably need methane to keep the earth warm, but that's very indirect. The evidence for it in light carbon isotopes, uh you know, these are actually methanotrophy, those are much younger records. Um you can come at it for you know, the absence of sulfate favors methane production and preservation, but that's not a direct measure of it. So we don't actually really know that much even about the methane and detectability of the methane cycle on our own planet. Um but maybe it was a half a billion years after the beginning of the planet. Um so if biological production at at 4 billion years ago. Um so you know, so where does that leave us? Um I I guess with with other planets. Um are these critical questions? This idea that I posed yesterday that it's important to think about a planet's long history and whether it went through a kind of evolution in a planetary system sense that might have fostered the beginnings of life. Is that a critical question when you're choosing a target, for example?",

        "transcript": "So I I um this this question of detectability is is extremely important especially in terms of time scale. Um, you know, and targets. So um, the reality is that our telescopes are just not powerful enough to see uh it's very difficult to see um exoplanet atmospheres and JWST will only get to hand, you know, maybe see a handful, maybe a little bit more. And so um, you know, going on the, you know, I think it's really important that the biologist tell the astronomers what are the most important bio signatures so that we can then better target um the right type of stars, um, and ages of stars. So the answer to um, uh Stilianos, I did not pronounce that correctly, so I apologize. Um, his question is is, you know, it's a very difficult question actually. In measuring ages of individual stars in in the night sky is actually extremely challenging to do. Um, Earth is about, you know, the sun is about 4 and a half billion years, but there have been planets found around 100 million year old stars and the only reason why we know that they're 100 million years old is because they're moving in a stream of stars where we can actually age date that collection of stars to a border 100 million years old. that's in the stream, you know, a paper that we published um not that long ago, a couple months ago. And so I think that, you know, time skills are very important part of this and that, you know, you don't you probably don't want to go and look for bio signatures on planets around uh, you know, very massive, relatively massive two or three times the solar mass because they're not going to live for very. They're going to live for tens of millions or maybe hundreds of millions of years. And so if life takes more than that time scale to to actually emerge then and actually go from being small cellular to to much more complex, then you're going to need to look around stars that are much smaller in order for life to exist. You know, the sun for example will will expand in about 5 billion years. So we have plenty of time uh to get off the planet. But um before that happens, but that's going to happen in 5 million year time scale for a very massive star. So, um we have to be I think these this idea of like what bio signatures are important and what is the time scale for those bio signatures to become relevant is actually an incredibly important question from the astrophysicist.",

So that's really a big change in how we think of the planet formation time scale by accelerating it so close to the age of the star then you have planets formed really early.

Um, I I think there's there's lots of like different directions to take that in terms of, you know, what we can say and what we can't say. Um, so in the history of our solar system, right? The outer planets seem really important because, you know, for one, this kind of late heavy bombardment comes out of these models of our early solar system dynamics where you kind of have the outer planets start migrating around a little bit. And as they migrate around a little bit, they interact gravitationally and they move around even more and in the process of doing that, they actually kick up a lot of the like remnant what we call planetesimals, which is just asteroids and comets. Things that got big during planet formation but didn't get planet sized. And so that movement of the outer planets starts to kick them up and they come flying into the inner solar system. And so that produces this kind of, you know, rush of impactors. But on the other hand, it seems like Jupiter maybe actually blocked a bunch. Like it could have been a lot worse because Jupiter is so big that it kind of like separated the inner part of the planet forming disc from the outer part of the planet forming disc and so, you know, Jupiter is like a big traffic guard kind of keeping all the comments from coming in and hitting us, right?",

Uh, the biosphere itself can be a very chaotic system in some sense and so you can have these sort of fluctua intense fluctuations with cascades of extinction because some sort of keystone species uh went extinct for some reason or or because some some major change happened in the biosphere.

The question is what are they? So looking for amino acids and lipids, um looking for uh something that could serve the role as DNA with something like a nanopore sequencer and looking for cell morphologies but also something um in conjunction with that maybe fluorescence or motility.

There are light relationships, there are many things, radio signals. Um, but there are also other classes of things like the red edge which can be very strongly related to terrestrial biomass um on our planet, grasses and trees and the like vegetation on land areas, uh algae in the ocean. So there are pigment classes as well. Many of the much of the focus has been on bacterial pigments in the surface ocean as being potentially detectable. That's a challenging field but it's certainly a possibility. There would be other things living in the ocean that might be detectable in a pigment sense. Look at chlorophyll on our own planet. Um, so a lot of it is is prokaryotic uh and impacts on atmospheric gases but it's not exclusively that.

Um, and where did life proliferate I said, um, uh we talked about wet dry cycles, um, and other places that they can occur besides the planetary surface like in the subsurface and ices. We talked um about gradients on tidally locked planets. Uh, and oops. Um, we talked oops, I just keep getting moved to another thing here. Oh, wait. Sorry. Okay, and then we talked what were the major external events that limited um, uh life's uh robustness I guess or or uh life's uh distribution. How how should we say that? And may constrain the timing of life. There was debate about the late heavy bombardment and was there even such a thing?
