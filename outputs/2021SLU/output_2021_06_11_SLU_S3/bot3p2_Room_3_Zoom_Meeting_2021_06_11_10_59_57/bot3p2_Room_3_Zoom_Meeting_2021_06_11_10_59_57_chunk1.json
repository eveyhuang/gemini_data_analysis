So before we do all of that, that extended introduction, I'm going to go ahead and read what our specific group is. It's a it's a long one, um but I think we have to kind of refresh ourselves. So we are time skin I'm Tim Lyons by the way.",

So the general idea is as biospheres are developing, how long does it take for that to happen? And in particular, how long does it take for that to happen in a way that it's robust, presumably robust means that it's sustainable even if it's evolving, it becomes a persistent feature of a planet is the way I would interpret robust and we but we can talk about that. And then I think as an umbrella for the overall purposes of this workshop, detectable. So something that could be detected either in situ on Mars, an icy moon through sample return or in an exoplanet through characterization of an atmosphere.",

            "transcript": "There's been an awful lot of discussion about exoplanets, but we're not limited to that of course. Um so we should think of take a wide scope in in how we view these things. How and when does does did life establish a biosphere? All origins are local by definition. How does primordial biology diversify to a point where it is robust and detectable on a planetary scale? Microbial evolution on the early earth, how did microbes spread across the early earth and affect biogeochemical cycling, evolution? How have successive waves of evolutionary innovation altered the structure and function of our planet? How long does it take our prebiotic chemistry to become biochemistry? Are there ways of bounding this problem on earth? Does the length of evolutionary time necessary for life to influence a planet's atmosphere depend on the planet's properties such as the amount of liquid water present on the surface, the thickness of the planet's atmosphere, etcetera. Okay, well now we're done, we're out of our time. So it's good to see you all. So, so that's a pretty tall order and we can unpack that a little bit. Um but before we start unpacking, let's let's go ahead and do those those introductions and don't forget to unmute yourself.",

Um I'm traditionally I was trained as a physicist, but then soon after uh and mathematics and then moved to biology though through the traditional sort of modeling biology route and nowadays my lab we do a lot of bioinformatics bioinformatics sequencing to understand the ecology and evolution of microorganisms both at contemporary time scales so we look at modern ecosystems like hot springs and oxygen depleted regions in the ocean, but we also uh do a lot of sort of phylogenetic reconstructions to look at the past evolution of microbes over over billion year uh time scales as much as that is possible with the data that we have.",
