I'm also interested in the in the microbiome as more of a biomarker as you noted um Judith um with this idea that many autoimmune diseases have environmental components that lead to autoimmunity but the mechanisms by which those environmental changes lead to immune changes and disease is not clear. And for me the microbiome has always stood in that space where it seems a plausible intermediate. So you have environmental change environmental exposures could lead to changes in the gut microbial or or not necessarily the gut but microbial communities within or on the body which could then in turn um mitigate certain immune changes and and disease. Um so I'm actually quite interested in it as as more of a biomarker and potentially a biomarker of early disease but that's definitely not something that's fixed in the literature or something that's really been shown is but it is an area that I'm very interested in overall.",

So that's I think that's a widely used to kind of establish causality, but I think as Judith was suggesting it's highly reductive. I mean, you can't the environmental factors, the composition of the microbiome, all of that is um on a much more simplistic level than what you would ever encounter in a human population. So even that I don't know how how satisfactory that is to establish causality, but it's maybe the best that we can do at the moment.",

There's just so many zeros um in the data sets because there's a lot of presence absence situations and even like RNA a lot of people will leverage techniques that were developed for RNA sequencing um and they'll try to apply that to the microbiome data sets but the structure of the data is different enough that that's questionable whether that's appropriate to do.
