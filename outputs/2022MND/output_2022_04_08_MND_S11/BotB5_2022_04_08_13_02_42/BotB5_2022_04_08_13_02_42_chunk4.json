I think I don't know if I'm putting words in your mouth but um yeah, it's typically just like blanket dysbiosis is associated with neurodegeneration or inflammation as far as I know.",

      "transcript": "Some of this comes down to the computational techniques that are available um which there's a lot of differing mathematical models and I am not a mathematician, I am not a computational person, but just having looked at this, there's a lot of ways to study the microbiome but it seems like the math the math isn't really wonderfully developed to study it. There's just so many zeros um in the data sets because there's a lot of presence absence situations and even like RNA a lot of people will leverage techniques that were developed for RNA sequencing um and they'll try to apply that to the microbiome data sets but the structure of the data is different enough that that's questionable whether that's appropriate to do. And so some of the tech some of the math that people will apply to microbiome data sets is suspect for false positives, especially when it comes down to saying, oh, we know there's more enisil in this person and less in this other person or the other group. Um it's just on that specific presence absence type of questions. So I think that again, I am not a computational person, but the need for robust and kind of a standard in the field in terms of the computational methodologies to compare presence absence and level of presence um is an area of need at least in describing. Like I guess it's less of a big deal in mice where you can control exactly what goes in.",

I don't know if it's outside the scope of the discussion or not, but for for autoimmune disorders for like the gut like IBD for example, there there's a very strong genetic component. So we know there are human genes that are that are causal and we know highly heritable so it goes you know, in the family. What is there a similar kind of high heritability of neuroinflammatory disorders? Does anyone know?",

Um there's 233 genes currently described as being common variants with slight increases in risk. So it's more of a overall genetic risk score situation where you have a cumulative burden of genetic predisposition.",

      "transcript": "That makes sense. I think the fact that there are many genes that are involved and each one has a smaller smallish effect is pretty common for um a lot of these kind of complex disease disorders. Do you know if anyone or anyone here maybe working on or worked on inflammatory disorders kind of includes the the role of the microbiome but also looking at the genetics of the host. Um I'm I'm just thinking is there potential for some kind of an interaction with the two? Maybe you need this microbe, but you also need this gene or genetic variant to kind of allow and this kind of interaction term basically.",

Um which you know, the hypothesis basically there is a genetic there is genetic control on the microbiome composition. Uh you know, we know the microbiome is it's kind of inherited herited to certain extent although very small. Um but we think there is a genetic control the microbiome composition, the microbiome affect the behavior. Um basically you can just map um you know the the genetic genes uh that associated with addiction and also at the same time map the microbiome genes uh and uh to say if there is overlapping low size for microbiome and uh addiction and then um just to link them together.",
