            "transcript": "I can comment a little bit on that um to just get things started. So I will say that the strongest links probably between dysbiosis and autoimmunity are for inflammatory bowel diseases. Um that's where those were originally um identified and described and those differences tend to be at the level of alpha beta diversity um is pretty clear um that there's changes there. There's also in the in the autoimmune bowel disease space there's um evidence that for example IGA coding um in the gut like the highly bound um high affinity IGA uh secreted by immune cells in the mucosa will preferentially bind pathobionts as opposed to um commensal organisms and so there's a immune connection there.",

Mostly what's been described is dysbiosis on the level of specific organisms that are more or less um prevalent or perhaps certain metabolic pathways metabolites that are more or less prevalent.",

There's you know a dozen or so papers that will say there's dysbiosis present but what exactly that dysbiosis is um is much less consistent from group to group and so um it makes it again a little bit challenging to um to interpret in my view.",

            "transcript": "Um I do believe that there's something there and then again going back to mouse models and MS um probably one of the more definitive examples would be a situation where there was a a mouse model um and there was germ free mice and they put uh human microbiome into the mice uh some some of the microbiomes were from MS patients other microbiomes were from healthy individuals and then they gave the mice EAE which is the animal model for MS. And the germ free mice now reconstituted with an MS microbiome had worse EAE than the germ free mice now reconstituted with a healthy microbiome um which does did to me kind of support the idea that there's probably is something going on here that we don't fully understand but at least on the human level the specifics are um not black and white certainly. Um and and Yanjiao feel free but that's kind of my uh 30,000 foot view of the space.",

There's some like several papers uh you put all the you know colon cancer you put all sort of disease together and there is always this inflammation related bacteria they they are the ones tend to change. Proteobacteria tend to be like a good marker uh you know people you know start to propose maybe proteobacteria as like inflammation inflammation marker for all just in general.

I think that there's at least animal models that would suggest that that is the case. I'm also interested in the in the microbiome as more of a biomarker as you noted um Judith um with this idea that many autoimmune diseases have environmental components that lead to autoimmunity but the mechanisms by which those environmental changes lead to immune changes and disease is not clear. And for me the microbiome has always stood in that space where it seems a plausible intermediate. So you have environmental change environmental exposures could lead to changes in the gut microbial or or not necessarily the gut but microbial communities within or on the body which could then in turn um mitigate certain immune changes and and disease. Um so I'm actually quite interested in it as as more of a biomarker and potentially a biomarker of early disease but that's definitely not something that's fixed in the literature or something that's really been shown is but it is an area that I'm very interested in overall.",
