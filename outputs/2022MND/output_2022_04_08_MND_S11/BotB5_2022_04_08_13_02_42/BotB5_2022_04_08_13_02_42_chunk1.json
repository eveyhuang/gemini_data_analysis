Um, yeah, so I'm uh trained as a chemical biologist and a microbiologist and my lab, uh, we mostly study gastrointestinal infections, not so much the microbiota directly, but we're moving more in that direction, I would say. We we use chemical tools to study uh metabolites, post translational modifications, enzymes that shape uh host microbe interactions in the GI tract, particularly um as they relate to bacterial and microbial bacterial and host adaptation to oxidative stress during chronic infection.",

And if someone wouldn't mind just popping the link to the Google Docs into the chat, I am struggling to find it because I didn't attend this morning's session. So I appreciate it. Thank you.",

And so um uh this sort of immune access here is is is um I'm really looking forward to this discussion. Um we're also interested in the interface of prebiotics with those bugs and so using privileged carbon sources to give those uh bacteria unique advantage in the gut um is something that we're super interested into and of course those uh dietary fibers and um also contribute to butyrate and therefore uh inflammation.
