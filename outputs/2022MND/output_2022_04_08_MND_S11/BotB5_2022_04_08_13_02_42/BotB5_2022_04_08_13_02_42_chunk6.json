Um, so validation of findings that are first found through correlation seems to be very difficult and missing often. And then there was some stuff about butyrate and I had to look up butyrate on the internet because I'm so far from the field that I didn't really know what it is. So I I put it in there that it seems to be associated with down regulating inflammation. Um, but there's all these questions about it also sounded to me like it's like the new kid or it's like a hot a hot kid on the block where like everybody wants to think about butyrate. Um, but it's very unclear like where does it need to like where is it required, where is it required. You can't really like get a good read out for it because it goes through the whole GI tract. Um, and so that's kind of a just a",

Um, and and and and there we are again with the causation and the and the lack of computational tools.

Um, there's so many different autoimmune disorders, there's so many different presentations of neuroinflammation and that is one of the challenges and I see a pro and a con here like is there because there's so many different disciplines like when we were talking about um mucosal immunity like there's just so many different specializations. Um, I just wonder if there's a way to agree on um specific inflammatory molecules, specific inflammatory pathways that need to be a beginning start across all of those different disciplines and like obviously the con to that is you could be missing some major things but to bring multiple fields together um, do we want to just look at this proinflammatory cyto. I mean, that's not a good example, but um is there a way to do like a a review across many different disciplines to see how what they all have in common and move on to multiple candidates before building next step ideas? I don't know.",

So I think we need much more more data from more individuals, not more, you know, types of data from the same individual, but a lot more individuals because I think some of these effects are pretty small. So it's not going to be just one microbe that's going to be found in all cases that has, you know, 100% uh effect, right? It's going to be multiple interactions and think to to identify those the more complex interaction, the bigger the sample size you need. So I think bigger sample sizes are are really important.",

It sort of pushed me out from chasing that and thinking actually about microbiome and metabolites because it just didn't seem like um circulating inflammatory molecules were as much of a factor. I could be very wrong and it's just that subtle changes have larger impacts downstream on other things, but it made me think maybe like um gut microbiome metabolites are having more of an impact.",
