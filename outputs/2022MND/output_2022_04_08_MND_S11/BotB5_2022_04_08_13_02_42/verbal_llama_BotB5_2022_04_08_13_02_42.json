It sort of pushed me out from chasing that and thinking actually about microbiome and metabolites because it just didn't seem like um circulating inflammatory molecules were as much of a factor.

So what's the like how similar do they need to be and do we need tens of thousands with a single technique because we're in for a world of herd if that's the case um or could we get with hundreds and could we combine technique what do you think Ron?

Um is it going to be just you know one microbe and each microbe is independently has an effect size or is it just this microbe that they have to be combined and have interaction between them. So this would all depend I think I don't know my my feeling based on nothing but just a feeling based on what we know from genetics is it's probably going to be in the thousands to get you know strong replicable um signals. Um and you know and the in genetics right the sample sizes now to look at some of the like diseases and phenotypes that have um many genes associated with them now they're looking at you know 500,000 sample size 500,000 or a million um or more and you keep finding more things right?
