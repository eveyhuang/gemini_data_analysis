So you could look at activity or other features. And I know that in mammalian models of uh of many of these diseases, there's a big focus on the cortex because it's, you know, what makes us human, but there's a lot of non-cortical regions and a lot of subcortical regions that I think are also affected and in even in a mouse, it you have to take out different pieces and assay them separately, it would be nice to get a bigger picture about the the whole flow of circuitry that might be disrupted to come up with hypotheses for then making organoids from different places, for example, um to in the brain to to look at specific features because I I pretty much imagine I mean, I think the microbiome is required for a lot of the normal developmental processes in many parts of the brain. So maybe a corollary for that is that if there are pathological processes that the microbiome could be involved in those too in many different parts of the brain in many different ways at the same time.",

Um, you know, we're able to identify enteric neurons that are are signaling specific metabolic cues, um, which we correlate with diet, but obviously diet's changing more than one thing.
