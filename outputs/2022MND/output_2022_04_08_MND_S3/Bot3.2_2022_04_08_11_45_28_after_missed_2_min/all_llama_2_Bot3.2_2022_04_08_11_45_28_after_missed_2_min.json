So you could look at activity or other features. And I know that in mammalian models of uh of many of these diseases, there's a big focus on the cortex because it's, you know, what makes us human, but there's a lot of non-cortical regions and a lot of subcortical regions that I think are also affected and in even in a mouse, it you have to take out different pieces and assay them separately, it would be nice to get a bigger picture about the the whole flow of circuitry that might be disrupted to come up with hypotheses for then making organoids from different places, for example, um to in the brain to to look at specific features because I I pretty much imagine I mean, I think the microbiome is required for a lot of the normal developmental processes in many parts of the brain.

Um, there are all sorts of parts of their brains where the circuitry is not right. And and many, I mean, uh, their digestive system doesn't complete its development properly. So there are very many aspects and you know, most of what we're looking at is early development. So what I would tell you is I think the microbiome is really critical for early development of every probably every body system except the ones that occur before they hatch out before they're exposed, which isn't to say that there aren't um then uh later features of those systems that are affected by the microbiome.
