Um, however, their pupal case itself is also coated with bacteria. So unless you treat their pupal cases with bleach, which you can do, it's called decornation. Um, they'll get the microbiome that's on their pupal case, um, which is typically sort of the microbiome of the population that's being kept in the same container.",

Um, but if you do anything to destabilize whatever's already in their gut, you don't have to completely wipe out whatever's in their gut. You can give some moderate doses of antibiotics that'll just destabilize the community, then that can sometimes be enough to push it out. Um, but for the most part, it's sort of a winner take all of whatever they eat first, which typically the first thing they eat is their way out of the pupal case. Um, so that's what they get.

Um, it's hard hard to get them, I mean, many many parts of their body are altered without a microbiome. So, uh, for example, they don't have enough beta cells in the pancreas. Um, there are all sorts of parts of their brains where the circuitry is not right. And and many, I mean, uh, their digestive system doesn't complete its development properly. So there are very many aspects and you know, most of what we're looking at is early development. So what I would tell you is I think the microbiome is really critical for early development of every probably every body system except the ones that occur before they hatch out before they're exposed, which isn't to say that there aren't um then uh later features of those systems that are affected by the microbiome. And so, you know, it's it's not just disease states by uh alterations in the microbiome that are that are important to understand. It's the it's the early developmental process.",

Um, so what we found is that when you keep flies in more nutritionally complex environments, then they need a microbiome. So probably in the wild, flies do need a microbiome. So if you keep flies on like a tryptophan free diet, um, it turns out that they can use their microbiome to metabolize tryptophan for themselves.",
