Um, so we develop organoid models of the peripheral nerves, particularly the interic nervous system. And so with these organoids, we've been working on so far is trying to uh come up with ways to model different neurological diseases and how they manifest in the gut and the interic nervous system. And so that includes some neurological diseases that primarily affect the brain like Parkinson's disease. And so from there, uh that's where I'm interested in the gut brain access. And so so far not a ton of focus in my lab on microbiome, but then of course because they play such a huge role in the gut brain communication, that's where I hope to go in the near future. Um, so thoughts around anxiety or like other psychological disorders and the gut brain interaction. So something that I didn't notice on the list of uh topics to cover is I guess I would like to also get people's perspective on the opposite direction, you know, like or not the opposite direction, but really how treatments for psychological disorders or mental health disorders affect the microbiome, um and you know, the nervous system as well because something that um has been overlooked a lot is the fact that a lot of these medications that people take for these mental health problems directly affect the interic nervous system and that then affects the motility, which then affects the microbiome. So a lot of these correlative things that you could see in patients uh could be a consequence of medications that they take um as opposed to the actual disease and are there tools that we can use to uncouple that, first of all, to really get at causality, um and our animal models really the best way to think about that, um or do we need more in vitro based models to get at that question.",

So there's some sort of like build up or stimulus that's causing that issue, you know, a lot of people experience stress but the outcome of that is different um between people. So I mean, I think I think of it as sort of like a cycle for vulnerability within the gut and then for that contribution and then layering a disorder on top of that and then feeding back literally and figuratively, excuse me, with um perturbing the system and like exacerbating symptoms.

Like I'm thinking for instance just elaborating on the the challenge that I was trying to talk about. For instance, if you look at depressed individuals, most of them have constipation, but it's most likely because they're taking SSRIs, which then acts on serotonin neurons in the gut that then causes them to not to not release enough neurotransmitters and cause constipation. So is it a microbiome problem or is it a direct effect of the medication or is it even a direct effect of the disease? So like depression, is it depression that's causing constipation or is it the SSRI that's causing the constipation? And where is the constipation coming from? And of course, if you have chronic constipation, you're going to have changes in the microbiome. So if you just look at microbiome and depression, you're going to see these correlations, but where is it coming from? So I think it's really important to think about all of these variables when you design these human based studies to like do this multivariate analysis and consider all these parameters and then in experimental models to really uncouple them one at a time. And that's something that I think is exceedingly challenging to do with mental health problems because animal models are really typically that we don't have the genetic diseases genetic models of depression in mice for instance.",

Um I think I personally think like immune system is involved and that's shown up um for sure, but if it was starting with let's say constipation um as one of those triggers, like there might be just something communicating that outside of the microbiome.

Um, so I do I do think that that's that's definitely a risk and it's where we need some of these causation studies where we do take naive wild type animals and and test microbial composition, um, and see if we can recapitulate features of any of these diseases. You know, I did have a really interesting conversation with someone in one of my groups yesterday where they saw changes in microbial composition in the gut after stroke. Um, and then they did fecal transplants from their stroke animals into naive animals and they saw hypertension in their naive animals. Um, and that felt like really nice confirmation that they could see a change and they could using the microbiome alone recapitulate features of that change. Maybe not every single feature of that change. Um, but some features of it.

Like I know for example on flies, um, people spend a lot of time wondering if changing the microbiome and flies would affect sleep. And it turns out that using at least microbial species that are naturally occurring in flies, there is very little change in sleep or daily activity. Um, now that may be different if you are engineering notobiotic flies with microbiomes from other animals, but if you just take the naturally occurring variability that you find in flies, which is very minimal. Flies only have like five to 10 different microbial components, um, it really doesn't affect sleep at all.",
