Everyone's like, oh, let's look at, you know, if you take anything and you look closely and not that whether it changes in X disease state, like maybe you'll find something. You know, we could be all looking at whether I discs shed differently in a whole bunch of different diseases and maybe we'd all jump on the I disc shedding train. I don't know. Um, so I do I do think that that's that's definitely a risk and it's where we need some of these causation studies where we do take naive wild type animals and and test microbial composition, um, and see if we can recapitulate features of any of these diseases. You know, I did have a really interesting conversation with someone in one of my groups yesterday where they saw changes in microbial composition in the gut after stroke. Um, and then they did fecal transplants from their stroke animals into naive animals and they saw hypertension in their naive animals. Um, and that felt like really nice confirmation that they could see a change and they could using the microbiome alone recapitulate features of that change. Maybe not every single feature of that change. Um, but some features of it. That felt very encouraging to me as somebody who definitely wonders like, are we just like all jumping on the microbiome bandwagon too fast sometimes.",

Like I know for example on flies, um, people spend a lot of time wondering if changing the microbiome and flies would affect sleep. And it turns out that using at least microbial species that are naturally occurring in flies, there is very little change in sleep or daily activity. Um, now that may be different if you are engineering notobiotic flies with microbiomes from other animals, but if you just take the naturally occurring variability that you find in flies, which is very minimal. Flies only have like five to 10 different microbial components, um, it really doesn't affect sleep at all.",

And I'm sure this has already been done, but I'm just not up to date on this area of the literature.
