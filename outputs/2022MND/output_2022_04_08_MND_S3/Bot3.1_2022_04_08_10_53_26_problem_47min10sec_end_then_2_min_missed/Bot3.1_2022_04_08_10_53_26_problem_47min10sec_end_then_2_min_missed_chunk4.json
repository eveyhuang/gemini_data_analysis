Um and there was obviously a ton of funding that went into building things like the cancer genome atlas, um where like it was essentially just sampling cancer across thousands, hundreds of thousands of individuals across multiple cancer types, just like RNA sequencing and genomic sequencing and then from there people like later on started mining things that are like like you know, signatures of melanoma in the subpopulation and signatures of this other type of cancer and then from there like making sense of networks and like nodes and regulons that could be targeted with drugs. So I wonder if there's any effort similar to this with the microbiome, just like profiling and building that sort of huge database across different disease states and even healthy states across lots of individuals to start to be able to mind something like that, like, you know.",
