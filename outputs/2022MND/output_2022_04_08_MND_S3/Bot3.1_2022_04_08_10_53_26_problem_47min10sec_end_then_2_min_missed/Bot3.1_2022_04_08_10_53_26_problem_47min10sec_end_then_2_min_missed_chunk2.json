My background is in methods development. So typically small molecule separation and detection so that we can look at a host of small molecules in, you know, your biological sample of choice. Um in my own lab we're going to start looking at C elegance samples and try to connect gut and brain um that way. And so I guess because I approach this from a slightly different angle, like I definitely see the chicken and egg um thing is a a prob not a problem but an interesting area to investigate. How does anybody have ideas on how we could determine which is first the chicken or the egg or is it just like a horrible spiral? Like what are some experiments that we could run? Like how do we decouple those.",

So we can we can take, you know, large panels of knock in knock out dose changes of different genes and say, okay, like if we're going to if we're going to say there may be a sensitized background because of some genetic component, then we can add these these second hits of some kind of environmental perturbation. Um and we can add those hits at different life stages of the animal um as well and ask, you know, in the background of age and genotype, how does this how does this new hit change a phenotype that we're interested in. Um I think can be, you know, one way that I look at it as somebody who's coming from a a small model systems background um as a way that we can leverage the power of of um of those types of systems.",

            "transcript": "Well, of course, genetics is the cleanest way experimentally to think about these problems, but when it comes to mental health, the genetics becomes more and more challenging. Like I'm thinking for instance just elaborating on the the challenge that I was trying to talk about. For instance, if you look at depressed individuals, most of them have constipation, but it's most likely because they're taking SSRIs, which then acts on serotonin neurons in the gut that then causes them to not to not release enough neurotransmitters and cause constipation. So is it a microbiome problem or is it a direct effect of the medication or is it even a direct effect of the disease? So like depression, is it depression that's causing constipation or is it the SSRI that's causing the constipation? And where is the constipation coming from? And of course, if you have chronic constipation, you're going to have changes in the microbiome. So if you just look at microbiome and depression, you're going to see these correlations, but where is it coming from? So I think it's really important to think about all of these variables when you design these human based studies to like do this multivariate analysis and consider all these parameters and then in experimental models to really uncouple them one at a time. And that's something that I think is exceedingly challenging to do with mental health problems because animal models are really typically that we don't have the genetic diseases genetic models of depression in mice for instance.",

Um, when it comes to most of these mental health disorders except for the very few instances where we have positive genes that are also present in the human population.",

            "transcript": "Um and then I look in the brain, I look at some behavior, but definitely where I'm should be moving towards is how does the gut communicate to the brain and brain to the gut. So obviously getting more directly at gut brain axis and this is just that added layer of like I don't have a a clear cut solution to it, but what would be the mechanism? Um I think I personally think like immune system is involved and that's shown up um for sure, but if it was starting with let's say constipation um as one of those triggers, like there might be just something communicating that outside of the microbiome. I mean, I know that it does communicate to the brain, but like the impact of it um on mental health. Um feeling just sort of like down because things aren't moving along or something, you know, or the opposite direction as well like with diarrhea then I think I can imagine a situation where you're like, uh, you know, you just don't feel good and that makes you, I mean in the categories of like depression or anxiety, that kind of thing like you just there's a um sensation, maybe vagus nerve um relay. I don't know. I feel like I could just throw out all of these here's what's in my mind that I don't have solutions to.",

I mean, we don't we don't know the genes, there are these complex phenotypes where, you know, we see changes in brain chemistry and we see changes in digestive function and we see changes, you know, that and because, you know, depression and influences behavioral choices, we see changes in what people eat and we see changes in how much time they spend socializing or exercising or outdoors. Um, and you know, all of those complex environmental choices are also going to to add on to whatever's whatever's happening. We see changes in sleep and you know, like are the sleep changes driven by the depression, you know, we get back to the same chicken and egg problem whether we're talking about diet or sleep or exercise or social time. Um, and it gets really difficult to untangle those. Uh, at least fruit flies aren't social, that does eliminate one problem for me.",
