            "transcript": "Uh I can start. Um, so my background, my name is Faranak Fati. I'm from UCSF. My background is in stem cell biology. Um, so we develop organoid models of the peripheral nerves, particularly the interic nervous system. And so with these organoids, we've been working on so far is trying to uh come up with ways to model different neurological diseases and how they manifest in the gut and the interic nervous system. And so that includes some neurological diseases that primarily affect the brain like Parkinson's disease. And so from there, uh that's where I'm interested in the gut brain access. And so so far not a ton of focus in my lab on microbiome, but then of course because they play such a huge role in the gut brain communication, that's where I hope to go in the near future. Um, so thoughts around anxiety or like other psychological disorders and the gut brain interaction. So something that I didn't notice on the list of uh topics to cover is I guess I would like to also get people's perspective on the opposite direction, you know, like or not the opposite direction, but really how treatments for psychological disorders or mental health disorders affect the microbiome, um and you know, the nervous system as well because something that um has been overlooked a lot is the fact that a lot of these medications that people take for these mental health problems directly affect the interic nervous system and that then affects the motility, which then affects the microbiome. So a lot of these correlative things that you could see in patients uh could be a consequence of medications that they take um as opposed to the actual disease and are there tools that we can use to uncouple that, first of all, to really get at causality, um and our animal models really the best way to think about that, um or do we need more in vitro based models to get at that question.",

I'm um a circadian biologist researching uh using fruit flies as a model system to understand neural control of um circadian feeding and metabolism and locomotor behavior and sleep. Um, and one of the models that we've developed is uh a closed head crush traumatic brain injury in fruit flies and we notice some of these um odd digestive phenotypes and one of the things that we're not sure of is like is is what's driving what? I mean, are we is it the head injury itself that's causing the changes in gut motility that we're seeing? Are there changes in feeding behavior? Are there changes in food preference? Um, you know, it's it's definitely a bit of a chicken and egg problem in terms of like what what's actually driving the changes that we're seeing.",

            "transcript": "I'm right there with you with my first instinct was this chicken or the egg problem. Um, obviously with a lot of these things there's some potential genetic component, environmental component, um, some vulnerability towards developing these. A lot of these also like on the list, stress, PTSD, depression, anxiety, um, are not necessarily presenting early in life. So there's some sort of like build up or stimulus that's causing that issue, you know, a lot of people experience stress but the outcome of that is different um between people. So I mean, I think I think of it as sort of like a cycle for vulnerability within the gut and then for that contribution and then layering a disorder on top of that and then feeding back literally and figuratively, excuse me, with um perturbing the system and like exacerbating symptoms. Um, I went right into that but side note, um, I'm I'm Linnea Freeman from Furman University and I'm a neuroscientist. My research is on um diet and sex differences and I do animal behavior, um, I look at gliosis, um neuroinflammation in the brain. Sorry, I'm like choking on a cracker that I was eating before.",
