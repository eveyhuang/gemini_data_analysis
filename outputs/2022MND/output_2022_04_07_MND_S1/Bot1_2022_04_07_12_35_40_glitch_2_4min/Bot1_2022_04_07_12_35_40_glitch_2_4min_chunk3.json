So if I can go back to the metabolites, I know that we we use losing chambers to study just physiology. So I you know, as I'm and to provide and researching fatty acids that would improve just to put the emphasis on can enable causation to in order to demonstrate that. The best one that I know of is IBD so where manipulating the microbiome in that way is a valid form of treatment and just that permeability is one of the other whether that's caused by microbiome changes is unknown at this point or is it simply that permeability is correlated with that. So now we're trying to put together genetics permeability microbiome and I don't think that's resolved right yet. But the other thing that",

So right now she has open label study but she's moving on to randomized control trial. Although she may not figure out the mechanism but at least with her study she may be able to show that changing microbiome is able to improve the behavior. And in terms of treatment, I think that's good enough for us. We don't need to know the intermediate mechanism. All we know that if we receive that specific microbiome you're able to improve the behavior. I think that's enough for of for our application.",
