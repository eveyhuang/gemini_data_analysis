There's a few people who are a little bit more fringe who are doing fecal transplants.

So the MS microbiota was associated with worse EAE in the animal models when it was done in germ free mice, which is a it's a pretty contrived system and it's super interesting. But it is a contrived system because uh germ free animals have weird immunology in the first place and so if they lived with weird immunology until the point when you transplanted them, it's not given that their immunology is going to go actually behave like it otherwise might have, but it it is really interesting and that there may be either bacteria or metabolites within um an MS population that could impact disease in some way. Um, but I think we're it's it's um I don't know. It it's almost one of those things that you can do as many experiments as you want, but unless you just jump in and do something, you're never going to know if it impacts the disease condition in real life um because I don't know that there's really a way to take it up to that point. So we'll see. I know I know there's a couple kind of fringe groups that are trying to do fecal transplants in MS patients with transplant their microbiota with healthy individuals microbiota.
