Um, so using culture systems or using animal models, you could use germ free mice to take the microbiota out of the picture, you could in or you could use like immunodeficient mice that have no immune system to try and tease out things that happen when the immune system doesn't get to be in play. I don't know. Uh, it's a but there's just so many moving pieces. I think you would have to take them iteratively and know that you're probably miss interaction effects, but you could learn about some of the iterations by taking away some pieces of the puzzle.",

            "transcript": "I would I would propose using like high throughput approaches, um, such as metabolomics, mespec metabolomics. Um, maybe as as Aaron mentioned, um, having a having an experiment where you have or don't have um certain bacteria and trying to see if the the chemical the chemical molecules in the blood or in the brain are um are any different. Um, metabolomics now, I mean if you work with metabolon, um, we work with metabolon, but um, you can get up to um, I think close 2000 small molecule metabolites and and different lipids. Um, so that's been a very kind of um a strong source of uh data that our group works in. They're not very strong in um natural in looking for natural products or secondary metabolites. Um, but um, you know, if you look at primary metabolites, which is which are which are pretty much everyone here probably have heard of like short chain fatty acids, amino acids, um, different types of uh lipids. Um, anyway, you could do some massive profiling. Um, there there was um, Emily, you may know this, there was a paper uh in uh, I think it was nature from Peter Dornstein's lab uh in 2020, um, where they found that gut derived metabolites, um, they I think they use some kind of C13 labeling or something, but they were able to find that all the metabolites made by gut microbes and this was in mice, they were later situated in different organs. Um, and that was that was fascinating to me. So they basically the gut does the gut microbes does send its send its chemicals um, I guess through the circulation and those chemicals are actually stuck in the organs and probably doing something they they have to be bioactive, but I found that to be quite fascinating.",

I think to answer the question about like what's the best approach, I think it really just depends on what question you're trying to answer because, you know, yeah, you can look at a holistic view of what's there, you know, but it doesn't tell you about what's it doing. Um, and so I think we need I think this came back from a discussion we had yesterday in the biosensing group is that you need a lot of different tools and techniques to be able to really answer these questions. You can't answer it all with one approach.",

Um, and for example, like you could take a question about somebody mentioned satiety earlier and whether um hormones are being produced by gut bacteria. and that's a more approachable question I almost think that you could identify those hormones and then figure out which bacteria are making them kind of by process of elimination. Like those questions are a lot more manageable than the big question which is like how does the gut communicate with the body, the brain. Um, which is just very, very complicated, but you know, taking a smaller question like, okay, in this question with this specific way, like that's more manageable.",

So if someone has an intact mucosal membrane and GI, you you might be able to um address this what's the kind of communication that happens between the gut and the brain in that context versus someone who has a really compromised barrier. What are the molecules that are coming through that way? Could we look at it that way?",

Maybe you this is a gap that all of you already know and I maybe it's just me who just has no idea. But is there because there's behavior obviously, but then is there something else that read is a readout or an accepted readout for information transfer? For example, sometimes it can be a morphologic change. Sometimes that's a information uh a readout for for something that has been stimulated, but to me, I I guess I I'm even lost on is there even a consensus on which which molecule if it is molecules we essay that is key that we would you would want to read out even in the simplest system. Let's say you even just take a, you know, a carcinoma cell line. What what do we do to it? A cell line, I guess that's not really a brain involved, right? But you're thinking you you want you're thinking there's some cell that's involved. So maybe you all have already an idea that I do not.",
