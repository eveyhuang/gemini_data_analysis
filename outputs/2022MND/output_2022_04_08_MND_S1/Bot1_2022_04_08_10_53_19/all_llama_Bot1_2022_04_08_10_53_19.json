Um, you know, this this is called the um lysogenic phase of the growth cycle, but um but what activates them from from the inserted you know, DNA content of viruses from coming out, that's that's really unknown, but it's been shown to be like, you know, anywhere from environmental stimuli to um um stresses towards the cell.

Um, but um, you know, if you look at primary metabolites, which is which are which are pretty much everyone here probably have heard of like short chain fatty acids, amino acids, um, different types of uh lipids. Um, anyway, you could do some massive profiling. Um, there there was um, Emily, you may know this, there was a paper uh in uh, I think it was nature from Peter Dornstein's lab uh in 2020, um, where they found that gut derived metabolites, um, they I think they use some kind of C13 labeling or something, but they were able to find that all the metabolites made by gut microbes and this was in mice, they were later situated in different organs. Um, and that was that was fascinating to me. So they basically the gut does the gut microbes does send its send its chemicals um, I guess through the circulation and those chemicals are actually stuck in the organs and probably doing something they they have to be bioactive, but I found that to be quite fascinating.",

For example, sometimes it can be a morphologic change. Sometimes that's a information uh a readout for for something that has been stimulated, but to me, I I guess I I'm even lost on is there even a consensus on which which molecule if it is molecules we essay that is key that we would you would want to read out even in the simplest system. Let's say you even just take a, you know, a carcinoma cell line. What what do we do to it? A cell line, I guess that's not really a brain involved, right?

And the rationale for that was really this one animal experiment that got published um in a a pretty good journal, but they took the microbes from an MS patient, they put it in a germ free mouse and gave the mouse EAE, which is our animal model for multiple sclerosis and it got worse uh uh EAE than uh a germ free mouse that was transplanted with a fecal microbiota from a healthy individual's microbiota. So the MS microbiota was associated with worse EAE in the animal models when it was done in germ free mice, which is a it's a pretty contrived system and it's super interesting. But it is a contrived system because uh germ free animals have weird immunology in the first place and so if they lived with weird immunology until the point when you transplanted them, it's not given that their immunology is going to go actually behave like it otherwise might have, but it it is really interesting and that there may be either bacteria or metabolites within um an MS population that could impact disease in some way. Um, but I think we're it's it's um I don't know. It it's almost one of those things that you can do as many experiments as you want, but unless you just jump in and do something, you're never going to know if it impacts the disease condition in real life um because I don't know that there's really a way to take it up to that point. So we'll see. I know I know there's a couple kind of fringe groups that are trying to do fecal transplants in MS patients with transplant their microbiota with healthy individuals microbiota.
