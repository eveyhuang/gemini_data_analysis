Um, for the enteric nervous system, my understanding is that the Vegas doesn't go all the way to the distal colon. So you have vagal afferents that reach the very proximal colon and then you have um sacral nerves, I think, that go the rest of the way. Um so the innervation is different, but it is very innervated.

Um, you know, this this is called the um lysogenic phase of the growth cycle, but um but what activates them from from the inserted you know, DNA content of viruses from coming out, that's that's really unknown, but it's been shown to be like, you know, anywhere from environmental stimuli to um um stresses towards the cell. Um, it's there's not a lot known. I actually my my postdoc and I have actually done some literature reading on this and surprisingly there's not a lot of um known evidence of how or why or when uh prophages are stimulated. But once it does, then it pretty much causes um havoc inside the, you know, gut kind of like a like an imbalance of the gut microbiome towards another steady state. It's actually really fascinating if you study the dynamics of how all this works. Um, yeah, kind of the reason why we got into this is um try to understand uh how how gut microbes gut microbes modulate each other and how they interact with each other and control the the growth of each other. And we thought it was you know, antibiotics made by this by um by gut microbes is one mechanism, but also viruses, they regulate the um kind of like the ecological landscape of the gut as well.

Uh, there was a paper recently last year in nature where they found um cross kingdom not cross kingdom, cross um maybe cross kingdom uh transmission of these of these viruses and different strains of coronaviruses. So you know, back to your question, um Irene, some can be cross kingdom uh transmission, but more likely very specified because it really depends on because how the virus actually, you know, identifies which host to target is really based on the receptors of the um um receptors of the cell of the host.
