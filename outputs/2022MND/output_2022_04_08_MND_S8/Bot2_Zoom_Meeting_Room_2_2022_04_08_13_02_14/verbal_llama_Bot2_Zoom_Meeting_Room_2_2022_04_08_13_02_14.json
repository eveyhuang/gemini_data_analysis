Um, the other advantage that, um, that I think about as somebody who's interested in aging, um, is that they while most people think flies live a pretty short time, they do live up to three months. Um, however, you know, we can look at aging on a much more rapid time scale than you can in other animal models. So we can we can do some of these manipulations in young and middle aged and older flies and follow them out, um, and kind of look at, um, at more complex, uh, uh, sort of environmental things than what you can feasibly do at a large scale in mammals.
