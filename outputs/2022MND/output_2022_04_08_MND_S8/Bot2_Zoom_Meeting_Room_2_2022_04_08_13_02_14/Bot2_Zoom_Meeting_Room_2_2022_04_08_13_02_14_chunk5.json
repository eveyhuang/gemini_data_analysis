And so um like the you know, thinking about one of the more the most reductionist models that you could kind of think about as as a model probably would be, you know, some interaction between a cell culture, um, you know, human human cell culture and and a microbial culture and that might be the way um to do it. But then I guess the bigger question is, you know, well, what questions are you going to be able to answer without or what questions are you going to be able to ask um when you are that reductionist.

But I guess in terms of sort of molecular conservation in in humanizing that's that's sort of what I was thinking in terms of that, but maybe there are other aspects. I mean the challenge that we have in invertebrates is is is um is we're primarily dealing with aerobes at least in C elegans, right?

Um and um, you know, so like there's only so far you can humanize a worm or a fly or even a mouse, um, you know, before you have to be like, okay, but this is still not a human. Um, so, you know, for example, with invertebrates, we can do these, you know, we can do drug screens, we can do um genetic screens, but you know, we probably can't do you know, community structure studies of of human like gut microbiome communities because it's just not a good system for that. Um, you know, no matter how much we try to humanize their immune systems or humanize their gut epithelium, it's just not going to work. Um, but on the other hand, you know, there you know, we we we have to just focus on the things that work, um, you know, and some of those things might not require large amounts of humanization, you know, we can things like knocking down conserved genes, like that's something these systems are good for. Um, so if we want to ask how are conserved signaling pathways and conserved neural circuits involved, that's, you know, that's a good question to ask in a worm or in a fly. Um, you know, how does microbial community structure shift in a in a human disease state is probably a bad question to ask in a fly.",

Um so there's a few different strategies, the single transplant or the repeated transplant depending on how well it sticks. Um and then more recently they've coupled that with uh human micro immune cells. So they'll do like a stem cell transplant um with you know, rag mouse or an radiated a an radiated immune uh competent mouse.
