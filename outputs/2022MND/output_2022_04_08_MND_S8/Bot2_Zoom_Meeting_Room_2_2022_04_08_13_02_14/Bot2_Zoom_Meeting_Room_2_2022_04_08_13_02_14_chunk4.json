If you're looking at metabolites are with is in there pretty well known and that's different. Just a thought.",

You know, typically they found for the system, for example, for a car T system that works for mouse T cell, the same system might not work for human T cell. I think this is the same consideration that they need to go through, but I do agree with Stephanie, what is a priority?
