Um and was showing that there is a 24 hour rhythm to breast milk composition including um total microbial load. So I I was talking about this with someone else who said that like overall the the number or the amount of microbes in breast milk is really hard to measure because it's very low so it's hard to do like analysis of the constituent components. Um but sort of the the ratios of like basic, you know, proteins, fats, um uh microbes etc had this um circadian variability in um in humans as does, you know, total production volume. Um and that this was correlated with some metabolic um demands of infants around the circadian day in a way that was really fascinating to me as sort of an ongoing maternal care microbiome interaction.",
