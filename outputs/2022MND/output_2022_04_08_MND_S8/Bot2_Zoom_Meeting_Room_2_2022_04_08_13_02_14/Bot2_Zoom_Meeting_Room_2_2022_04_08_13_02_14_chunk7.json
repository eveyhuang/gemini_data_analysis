So, you know, and in humans, of course, we're um uh not inbred at all and and to achieve that kind of mouse population for a study, you usually take several different inbred strains, cross them with each other, go through a few generations and generate populations of mice that are um genetically diverse.",

Um, they have mutations that uh are in the innate immunity. So they're actually probably not great models for humans because we don't naturally carry those mutations, they just happen to have been fixed in them. So there's that kind of stuff. Uh, at Jax, uh, when we were just talking about um clean and things like that. So the way they raise their mice at Jax, you know, they're in the the technicians are wearing space suits, they're in uh rooms that are, you know, airlocks and things like that.",

            "transcript": "Um, there's as much effort as possible with the food and the environment to make it as reproducible as possible so the mice are all the same and what you get is a uh a very clean mouse in in the sense that we were talking about before, specific pathogen free. But um, it's not, you know, if you if you compare that microbiome to the microbiome of a wild mouse, totally different. And and there are a number of models and things like that where people show that wild mice are are better than, you know, a good uh mouse from Jax off the truck. Um, we did when I was at Wash U, we had a mouse model where one mouse was killed by Clostridium difficile and another mouse was resistant to it.",

            "transcript": "And the difference was they were both black six. The one that was sensitive was the one from Jax off the truck. The one that was resistant was the breeding colony at Wash U in the vivarium. And in those breeding colonies over time, no matter how well you maintain the vivarium, you're selecting for resistance to whatever the stuff is that's in the environment there and you're not going to get genomic changes, you're going to get microbiome changes that make them resistant. So we showed that you could take the microbiome from the breeding colony mouse, put it into the Jax mouse and make the Jax mouse resistant. And even narrowed it down to four there were four particular taxa um and you had to have those together, but that matched what the fecal transplant did. So um, and this the comment that was made earlier about different vendors, you get mice that behave differently, they have different microbiomes, that's the same thing. Uh, not not everybody, you know, Taconic is not quite as clean as Jax is, things like that.",

Um, and and and there's famous stories of of mouse models for disease that work in some institutions and not others. And again, it's just because the vivaria environments are different from all of those. So you have all of that kind of stuff going on, genetic things, inbred things, environmental things, stuff like that that you have to keep in mind and you have to choose from what what your real goal in the experiment. Um, humanized mice um uh we we put human microbiomes into mice um not so much to humanize them, but to like we we've got a mouse model of Nash, fatty liver disease.",

So, you know, that's the kind of cool experiment that you want to do to try to to use the mouse model despite all of its misgivings for something like that. Um, but the comment that was made before about humanizing the mouse immune system, um, you don't actually have to radiate them, you just give them stem cells, the right human stem cells at a very, very early age.",

Jax people are always working all the time to improve how comprehensive that that is. But that's used for things like uh testing immunotherapy, you know, checkpoint inhibitors, the human checkpoint inhibitors will work on that. They weren't they won't work on a mouse immune system because there's enough difference in the targets, the antigenic targets for the monoclonals.",

Um, it's uh and then ultimately there's the question is, you know, how's how similar so the the the the organisms, the bacteria in the mouse are different than the bacteria in the humans, but functionally they might be doing the same thing. It just might be different uh taxa that are providing the functions.",
