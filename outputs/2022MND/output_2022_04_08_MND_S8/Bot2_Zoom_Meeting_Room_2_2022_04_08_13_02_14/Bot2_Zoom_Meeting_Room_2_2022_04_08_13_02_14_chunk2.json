            "transcript": "So one of the the questions in the drosophila world is like what's the point of a microbiome for a fly? Um we have identified that in more naturalistic conditions um a microbiome a more complex microbiome that we find in wild caught flies can contribute to um synthesizing nutrients in nutrient poor diets and things like that. But in general investigating native fly microbiomes is has not been a particularly fruitful area. But the advantage of flies like other small invertebrate model systems is the massive genetic screens that we can do with notobiotic flies where we give them a different more interesting microbiome from somewhere else.",

So I think it's it's more useful as a screening tool in a semi semi-humanized or mammalianized system than than on its own merits.",

What's super convenient about flies is it's very easy to give them a new microbiome. Um flies establish a microbiome twice in their lifespan because they undergo metamorphosis. They have one microbiome as larvi and they uh completely reform their gut and develop a new microbiome as an adult. Um so it's very easy to raise asenic flies and then simply feed them on a seated medium either a medium that's been exposed to feces of another um another organism or you know a precisely controlled mix of bacteria um on a lawn and they'll eat it and reestablish a new microbiome.",

So so um in in terms of in terms of thinking about the diversity of the taxa that are associated with C elegance in the wild, but then also what what overlap are there with with the taxa that are present in the in the human microbiome. And so for C elegance is primarily gram negative uh either aerobes or or facultative anaerobes. Um and so yeah, we we sort of look at it this way is there's there's in terms of how it relates to human biology is there's two areas I guess that we sort of think about is is at the microbial strain level where what what levels of overlap are there there. And then like Annika was mentioning um what are the where are there conservation in in sort of molecular targets. And so are there conservations in receptors or receptor families. So in C elegance we have we have conserved monoamine receptor families, cannabinoid receptor families, opioid receptor families and in some cases those can be uh uh activated by similar ligands where those are sort of activated in in in mammals. But um in other cases there's not going to be overlap and we're sort of interested in the ecology in those cases.",

            "transcript": "I mean, you know, so so some things that are nicer we can we can control a large number of of things, you know, we can use isogenic strains, um, you know, we can really precisely control the composition of the microbiome if we want to because it is so easy to make asenic and notobiotic animals and because asenic animals are so healthy, um, you know, that we don't, uh, you know, we can we can easily like let animals develop with a microbiome, then remove the microbiome or let them develop without the microbiome and then give them one or switch microbiomes midway through their lifespan and see if something changes, um, in the same animal so that we can do that type of longitudinal study, um, you know, quite easily. Um, the other advantage that, um, that I think about as somebody who's interested in aging, um, is that they while most people think flies live a pretty short time, they do live up to three months. Um, however, you know, we can look at aging on a much more rapid time scale than you can in other animal models. So we can we can do some of these manipulations in young and middle aged and older flies and follow them out, um, and kind of look at, um, at more complex, uh, uh, sort of environmental things than what you can feasibly do at a large scale in mammals. So for example, we can, you know, I've designed systems where we're looking, you know, at animals that are in a light cycle, in a temperature cycle, on several different food substrates across a lifespan, you know, all together with multiple genotypes, um, in a pretty high throughput way that's hard to do in other model systems.",

            "transcript": "I have a question. Um, so I have some experience working with genetic mouse models. Um, and in cases where, um, if you mimic the human disease, um, the mice can still overcome the perturbation. So, like the example that comes to mind is a disease called Smith Lemley Opitz syndrome where, um, patients are, um, unable to synthesize cholesterol, so they get the the pathway gets stuck at seven dehydrocholesterol, which is considered somewhat toxic. Um, so I'm curious, but mice, so even though they biochemically have this disorder, they can like revert back and like somehow still live and and be okay over time, like they don't get the accumulation. So do you see this in lower order model systems in terms of like the microbiome, like if you introduce a microbiome, like that that that the animal itself somehow like, I don't want to say like corrects, because I don't know that it's right, but changes.",

So I think there's going to be a lot of host um, you know, host differences in how the microbial community structure is going to change based on based on the physiology of the host epithelium, based on the diet of the animal host, um, you know, interacting with the microbes that are there to influence the community structure.",

So if you sort of disrupt the biosynthetic pathway in a worm, there are cases in which a particular microbe can just supply the the metabolite and replace the the biosynthetic pathway in the worm. So um I don't you know, it's it's a simpler challenge I think in a in a in a in a worm for that to occur I think than it than it is necessarily in an animal with uh separated and complex tissues.",
