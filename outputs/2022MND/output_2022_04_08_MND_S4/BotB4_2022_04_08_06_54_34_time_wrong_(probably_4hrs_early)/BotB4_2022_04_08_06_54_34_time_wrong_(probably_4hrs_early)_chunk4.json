Um, like there's definitely cases where pathogens are clearly making metabolites to influence the immune system and you can, you know, put together fairly compelling hypothesis as to that they're, you know, shaping a habitat in such a way, but is a tryptophan metabolite made by a bacteroides species, is that just the way that it's eating tryptophan, um and it happens to make something that activates the brain or is it being selected for um and in in such a way that it's going to affect the host. And that's the question.",

Um, and very clearly the the bacterial are so doing it and I don't I think that the the best line of I mean, not that it answers the question of the chicken and the egg, but very clearly this is where germ free animals are key in showing us that well, look, we cannot function normally without these microorganisms and without these metabolites. Is it to the benefit more of one or the other? That that I I don't think well I I certainly don't know uh the answer to that, but I think there there's enough there's enough data and evidence out there that that shows us that we we one cannot really function without the other. And I do tend to think that it's the mammalian host that cannot function without these microorganisms because I mean yes, we're providing them a fairly stable environment, but we find these microorganisms everywhere. So like if it wasn't us, they would find another another environment and still proceed with their with their metabolism without any issue. So yeah, it's um it's a cool question.",

But um that's but those neurotransmitters, those neuropeptides and this comes back to Mark and and Farx uh project here at Silog. Um, if they're making things that increase motility, right? That favors particular organisms, right? So if you're a fast grower, if you're a fast grower, you would want things to be more motile, right? So that you would increase your population because you would clear out the slow growers, right? Um, and so that you know, that's a that's a potential hypothesis there, but you know, as Mark as Mark also said too like yeah, these things just need sometimes a bacterium just wants to get rid of electrons and it'll just do it when it in whatever way possible, right? So acids like short chain fatty acids are just, you know, a way to dump electrons.",

Um so yeah, I I don't know are there any examples of, you know, like complex secondary metabolites um affecting you know, the nervous system in in in certain ways made by the gut?
