It's it's with the idea that there are different once again, there are many different members within the gut microbiota and it coevolution between these different members um like might have might have different impacts on the human host. Like the whole point of all these microorganisms like co-evolving is to like stay within the system whereas we theoretically want to get them out or want to keep some of them. So it I think there's a there's a notion of scale that we also have to consider in terms of coevolution because basically within a month coevolution could have happened for microbial communities are turning over very rapidly but there's very clearly no coevolution at that stage in in terms like from the host perspective. So I guess it kind of depends on what coevolution level are we looking at because that will definitely have very different results and and and the the time frame, the temporal studies that Nandita was talking about, I think become essential there and and at very different levels like obviously like at daily levels but also over the course of the lifespan or even human history because I mean yes we've co-adapted with these microorganisms but our diet now doesn't resemble by any stretch of the imagination like homo sapiens like early on. So there it it just that that there's this shifting frame the whole time at different levels and I think that's for me conceptually probably the most like complicated and most probably interesting thing to to to look at is trying to see like how can we integrate these different temporal levels and scale levels also in in terms of coevolution.",

Those bifidobacteria help calibrate um the immune system for commensals. They um and they, you know, their presence leads to the abundance of butyrate in the infant gut and this is mediated by several genes that attach uh extra sugars to lactose in memory tissue. So, um this is a this is I think a pretty clear example uh where the human uh we've we've got these genes to put fucose and cylic acid and and other things on on lactose um and and protect them uniquely uh to the benefit of the host by uh you know, recruiting um bifidobacteria which then you know, then all likelihood uh trade and evolve uh these things to um these enzymes that allow the breakdown. Um, but that leads me to think about carbohydrates as uh almost everything we've talked about here has is has carbohydrates involved, right? Um, bacteria, right? Uh uh uses um uh has Lewis X like structures, right? Um, and and it helps it bind um to uh to its substrate uh in the gut in the stomach. Um, you know, the human milk color saccharides, lactose, almost everything is carbohydrates in it. Now, that is my hammer and I'm seeing lots of nails.

But now if you have microbes coming flowing through you that you don't have any control over really who who passes through and who colonizes and things like that, how do you deal with the fact that they're making neurotransmitters?

If you look at that same gene in human, does those gene also associate with micro in human?",
