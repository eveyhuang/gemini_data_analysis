But I think it would be very cool if a genetic change in the microbiome is shown to affect anything in the host, whether it's phenotype or gene expression, which is considered a phenotype, uh, and or uh RNA editing, like I think we're still trying to understand what is that these genes and nucleotides are doing in the microbiome is just so vast and being able to whittle it down to this mutation causes this will be quite a quite an exciting advancement.",

We've had some, I mean, we have some data where we can look at look at microbiome and how is associated with gene expression in the host in like in gut tissue. Um, and then looking at the genetics of the microbiome, we can do something like an EQTL analysis where the mutation or the snip is in the microbial genome and not the host genome. So similar methods. Although it's probably much more trickier than that, but but seems doable.",

I think um, like you can think about it more broadly in terms of like host phenotype, like going back to the uh um topic of the conference which is on neurological disorders. Are there genotypes in the microbiome that influence uh human uh neurological disorders? The thing is that doing G was with the microbiome as the input, I think will be hard because you have um like when we do G was with human populations, we're dealing with population structure and we also know that there's recombination. Uh, and so in the microbiome, we these are clonal populations. So but they do actually recombine a decent amount, which is good for purposes of doing like a G was. But how do we deal with the population structure of like a hundred microbes? Maybe it's doable and we just need to do it.",

And when you get a specific interaction between a particular host gene and a microbe's abundance, that that seems to be getting close to an example of coevolution or something like that, right?",

But the problem is that the study of commensals is so recent that we have very little understanding of how commensals have impacted humans. It's actually uh if you look at the literature, most of the uh studies have focused on pathogenic bacteria. So I think it's a really exciting future direction for the field.",

So we may I mean it's it's a start, but we may only get like the final bacteria that that or or the bacteria that leads to like the final metabolic step uh that we would follow and we wouldn't have like the three other bacteria that were involved in it. But but still, like you have to start somewhere. So yeah, I think I think it's a something that could be looked into.",

We control their diet, their light cycle, their environment, everything about them and under those strict conditions, gene X selects for microbiota Y.",
