So we're interested in live biotherapeutics. So um, the the questions we ask are how can we make a live biotherapeutic which is secreting a small molecule peptide or protein more robust in this environment. And so that is on the genetic level and we are developing some genetic tools in lactic acid bacteria, but also um on the uh at the interface of prebiotics uh and uh probiotics of interest uh feeding them with particularly privileged carbon substrates in order to give them an ecological advantage in that uh in the gut milieu.
