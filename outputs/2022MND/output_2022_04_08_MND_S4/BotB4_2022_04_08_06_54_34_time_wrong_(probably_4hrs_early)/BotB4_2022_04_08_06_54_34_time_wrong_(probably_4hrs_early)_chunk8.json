And in human genetics, we does take a lot. We we we can do like uh HDL cholesterol and then heart disease and then you find the variance that control LDL and then ask if those variant is linked to heart disease in order to infer the causal relationship between LDL and heart disease. You can do similar analysis for blood metabolite and psychiatric disorder.",
