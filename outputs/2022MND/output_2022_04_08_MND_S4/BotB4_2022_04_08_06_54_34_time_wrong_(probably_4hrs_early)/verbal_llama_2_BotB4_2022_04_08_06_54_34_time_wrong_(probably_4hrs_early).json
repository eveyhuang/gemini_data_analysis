Um but the idea that populations that don't have helmet infection are more likely to have autoimmune diseases um is one that we use a lot to rationalize some of the work that we do.

It's it's with the idea that there are different once again, there are many different members within the gut microbiota and it coevolution between these different members um like might have might have different impacts on the human host. Like the whole point of all these microorganisms like co-evolving is to like stay within the system whereas we theoretically want to get them out or want to keep some of them. So it I think there's a there's a notion of scale that we also have to consider in terms of coevolution because basically within a month coevolution could have happened for microbial communities are turning over very rapidly but there's very clearly no coevolution at that stage in in terms like from the host perspective. So I guess it kind of depends on what coevolution level are we looking at because that will definitely have very different results and and and the the time frame, the temporal studies that Nandita was talking about, I think become essential there and and at very different levels like obviously like at daily levels but also over the course of the lifespan or even human history because I mean yes we've co-adapted with these microorganisms but our diet now doesn't resemble by any stretch of the imagination like homo sapiens like early on. So there it it just that that there's this shifting frame the whole time at different levels and I think that's for me conceptually probably the most like complicated and most probably interesting thing to to to look at is trying to see like how can we integrate these different temporal levels and scale levels also in in terms of coevolution.

Uh uh uses um uh has Lewis X like structures, right? Um, and and it helps it bind um to uh to its substrate uh in the gut in the stomach. Um, you know, the human milk color saccharides, lactose, almost everything is carbohydrates in it. Now, that is my hammer and I'm seeing lots of nails.

Is it to the benefit more of one or the other? That that I I don't think well I I certainly don't know uh the answer to that, but I think there there's enough there's enough data and evidence out there that that shows us that we we one cannot really function without the other. And I do tend to think that it's the mammalian host that cannot function without these microorganisms because I mean yes, we're providing them a fairly stable environment, but we find these microorganisms everywhere.
