            "transcript": "So we've mammals have evolved to have a microbiota. We take advantage of the signals that they provide. Um, they like building on what Corinne said about fiber, we don't have enzymes to break them down. We rely on the microbiota to do that. So on the evolutionary time scale of us of mammals, we've responded to the need to have these or we've lost if we ever had them, the ability to make enzymes that degrade fiber or lactase. So we've had genetic changes in response to being in contact with these things. But if the microbes can just evolve quicker, is that still coevolution? There you're responding to environmental changes that we introduce to them, but they have to be within us.",

If if if only one adapts, but the other one doesn't get any benefit from it, this is just this is just a symbiosis, which is an interaction between two members. So I would go with the idea that either both need to benefit or one benefits to the expense of the other because it doesn't have to be a positive coevolution, but definitely both players or or all the players involved have to have some kind of like response or change to the evolution or or change in the other one. Like it it it has to be everyone involved, at least according to me.",

            "transcript": "I just I have an example that I think might fit everybody's definition but I'm not sure and it's it's got me thinking about the the mechanisms by which um host and microbe communicate. And the example that I would throw out is again, directly from my area of expertise is is human milk oligosaccharides, right? So human milk oligosaccharides uniquely feed bifidobacteria. Those bifidobacteria help calibrate um the immune system for commensals. They um and they, you know, their presence leads to the abundance of butyrate in the infant gut and this is mediated by several genes that attach uh extra sugars to lactose in memory tissue. So, um this is a this is I think a pretty clear example uh where the human uh we've we've got these genes to put fucose and cylic acid and and other things on on lactose um and and protect them uniquely uh to the benefit of the host by uh you know, recruiting um bifidobacteria which then you know, then all likelihood uh trade and evolve uh these things to um these enzymes that allow the breakdown. Um, but that leads me to think about carbohydrates as uh almost everything we've talked about here has is has carbohydrates involved, right? Um, bacteria, right? Uh uh uses um uh has Lewis X like structures, right? Um, and and it helps it bind um to uh to its substrate uh in the gut in the stomach. Um, you know, the human milk color saccharides, lactose, almost everything is carbohydrates in it. Now, that is my hammer and I'm seeing lots of nails. But uh, you know, that's I think as a as a a mediator of this um coevolution is something interesting to think about.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I I agree with that Tom and like I think another good example too is the rumen microbiome where a good deal of the energy that feeds the gut of ruminants is the fermentation of carbohydrates to butyrate. And that's the I mean it's largely true or maybe somewhat true in the human gut as well where the colonocytes tend to derive the majority of their energy from there. Um, I guess for me part of the question is that I'm scared of microbial ecologists and sort of evolution type people because they have very strict definitions for things. So I feel like I don't know, can you use the word coevolution or someone yell at you and and I think the latter might be true so I tend to not use it.",

So, um, uh we we're we're we're hitting good general principles here of metabolism and things like that. But but I think they want to bring the discussion a little bit more focused on the gut brain axis too. I mean, the one thing that that comes into my mind is uh microbes make neurotransmitters. Um, and so, you know, if there weren't any microbes and all the neurotransmitters came from uh the host cells, you can imagine it was very tightly regulated and controlled and things. But now if you have microbes coming flowing through you that you don't have any control over really who who passes through and who colonizes and things like that, how do you deal with the fact that they're making neurotransmitters? How does that keep you from going haywire and things like that? That's got to be part of the the discussion about uh gut brain and microbes and and coevolution. How does it control?
