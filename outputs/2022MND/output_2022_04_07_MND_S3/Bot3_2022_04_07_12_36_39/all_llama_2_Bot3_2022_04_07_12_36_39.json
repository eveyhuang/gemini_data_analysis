He advised me not to do it till there is a technique that come along and non culture to do it. And I was always mindful of that. But I said whatever is in inside the the gut, if the barrier function is appropriate, then it can act as a partition. Therefore my readout was barrier function from 80s in 2000 till I became aware of the non culture the DNA based technique that we got into the microbites. And initially obviously was GI and then I become agnostic and because all diseases and I have a bias and environmental factor promote non communicable diseases through the GI as a gateway and microbiota as a middle man.

They all have a peak of activity in the morning and a peak of activity in the evening. Um, and I got really interested in investigating feeding rhythms, which is something newer in flies because we haven't really had the resolution to look at single fly feeding until more recently. Um, and so when I started to look at feeding, I thought that their feeding patterns would follow their locomotor activity, that they would eat the most when they were walking up, walking around, being awake the most. Um, and I thought that when I looked at classic circadian locomotor rhythm mutants that I would see the same deficits in their feeding rhythms. And what I found is that for flies, um locomotor activity and feeding rhythms are very decoupled.",

Um, actually, um, a couple of studies that have, well, they looked at largely undergraduate and graduate student populations. So I'm not sure how representative their food intake patterns are, probably amongst the worst, but um, they had they had students that wore um like essentially fitbits and then there was a button on their fitbit that they could press every time they put food in their mouth. So it was it was a really like they weren't trying to get them to log every meal. It was just like when you start eating press the button, when you stop eating press the button again. Um, and they found that on average in a cohort of thousands of students, people were eating 14 to 16 hours a day. Um, and um, so like between their first meal and their last meal, they were eating up to about 16 out of 24 hours. Um, and there's quite a lot of data that shows that restricting your feeding window to 10 hours or less per day is very beneficial for your health. Um, and so, you know, 16 hours is a pretty pretty broad window. Um, and and outside of the window of what most animals would eat um that are not humans. But most animals don't have insomnia cookies.

Well, I don't want to spend all the time in in time and circadian although that is one of my interest. But one thing that uh I I'd like you to consider for the environmental factors that you are going to study, you you have to consider that the time of that environmental factor exposure to the host can have an impact.

        "transcript": "So, you know what's really so there are like there are methodological templates to do this, you know, in a very high throughput fashion. So, you know, ostensibly what you could do is you can take human derived IPSCs, derive them into say neurons. And then you can put them into a very well described, well characterized like microfluidic system and you can just pulse through and do this massively parallel and measure all the analytes, all of the outcomes for that. The big question though is then somebody in study section is going to say, well that is not an accurate representation of the human brain or a vertebrate brain because how do you account for neuroal interactions? How do you account for synaptic interactions? How do you start to account for, you know, this new idea that it's not just chemical synapses, it's electrical synapses. So how do you recapitulate those very complex network interactions? So then you're stuck having to do this in an actual model. Mice are expensive, housing is expensive. You know, you can do it for like 20, but then when you start thinking about I need to do this for a thousands, that gets really, really crazy, really, really fast. Um, hey, so this is like the common, you know, this is the frustration and the the roadblock that I've come up against is, you know, we need to very at the very bare minimum start to describe some of these things at a foundational level. Then I write that exact grant to the NH and they say like, well we're not interested in description, we want a mechanism. And you're like, you show me a mechanism. There's no way to do this unless we actually even understand what it looks like to start with. So to me that's the the common tension with a lot of this, especially, you know, as a physician scientist, my my whole idea is I want to translate this. Like how do we help people? Um, don't get me wrong, I love the fundamental stuff. I'll I'll dig in the sandbox with all of y'all, but um, ultimately, how do we translate this into clinical populations?",

And so something like that would be really interesting, but I think that the challenge with any of like the microdialysis sampling, microfluidic techniques, all of these things is that it's not something that you just jump into. Like it's something that you build yourself oftentimes and that's hard to translate into like the clinic or into, you know, biology labs or whatever.

So I guess after hearing all like what you guys talk about and, uh, just makes me think like, uh, this is really like super complicated because I need to take into account all these, um, different environmental, um, exposure even at different time, and also the host might kind of, um, respond in different ways, at different host like even. So, um, and, um, but that also gets me to think more of that how can we reduce it to a more simple system, uh, I guess between the host and this micro uh organism kind of interactions. Um, so for at different time or different kind of exposure, um, whether we can reduce that to maybe, for example, the immune response, like, uh, right, you you say exposure at different time and then host might respond different so is it because, um, at different time our immune protection will be like most active certain time. So therefore, because my organism is kind of under check, um, by our immune system. Um, so like whether we right, so, um, let's then goes to, uh, I guess how the environment could maybe possibly affect the, um, protein folding problem like from the gut to the brain. And, um, if so there's one recent publication and talking about one of the microorganism, one bacteria and on their surface they have a protein that, uh, has a shape of the, um, beta amyloid. So, uh, how protein is prion like protein aggregate like taking place is because once they have a seed protein and that will help the propagation of the right all of the physiological protein, they will start like propagate more. And, um, so I don't know how many of these like, um, bacteria already could potentially already have, um, such kind of protein on their surface and, uh, right, so we can imagine that even their metabolize when the protein are degraded, when the bacteria degraded and then this protein whether they can be uptake by the, um, micro gut, the gut brain axis and that could for sure can affect, um, the neurodegenerative disease like development. Um, but what I don't know so much is I don't know what's the time scale like from the gut to the brain. Um, so for the protein aggregate to transmit from the gut to brain, that's a very long process that takes very, very long time. Um, but, uh, I I wonder whether there's more immediate. Of course that's very difficult to study, but whether there's a more immediate effect like from the gut to the brain that we can look at. And, uh, I think Ali you might know that much better that the information, I guess the small molecular mediated whatever transmission from the gut to brain, um, that probably will happen much more immediately and, uh, whether we can look at the information in brain and, um, and, uh, yeah, I still don't know how to quantify what whatever happens in the gut and to find the correlation.",

I mean, I mean there's just too much too much stuff in between. Um, the exposome also accounts for a ton of other uh, physiologic systems that you otherwise probably wouldn't consider in a traditional experimental system. So neuroendocrine, um, hepato biliary, I mean all these things play a role in all this sort of metabolite and sort of the ultimate processing of everything that's happening. Um, I know that I have a lot of, you know, I'm one of the the directors here at Wisconsin for the Center for Health Disparities Research and what we're trying to do is understand social determinants of health at a molecular level and it's going it's all about that idea of an exposome.

Um, you know, uh there are a number of studies that show that, you know, while mice are nocturnal in lab conditions, many mice in naturally occurring um like field conditions are actually diurnal or crepuscular um for example. So, you know, we're when we conduct these kinds of basic science experiments, we're doing them in such stripped down environments that we're we're oversimplifying to something that's not representative anymore. Um, but trying to figure out which which factors to add back in because obviously we can't just like keep fruit flies, I don't know, in our backyards because that's too variable.

Um, so I think that there are ways to do that, but it's it's that balance between the variability of the data not being able to tell us about some of these specific mechanisms when we open it up to, you know, all of the different rats in their environment outside versus the more controlled, okay, we have this feeding schedule, we have this light dark cycle and this is the single thing that or, you know, single tiny host of things that we're trying to manipulate and look at these specific neurotransmitters or what have you, biomarkers. I do think that it's an interesting and again, it's that translational jump from small animal models like the fruit flies fruit flies and the C elegans to the larger animal rodents to humans and you know, how do we make that process a little bit easier because I think that it would be really nice if we could do all of our research in C elegans and fruit flies from a practical and ethical standpoint.
