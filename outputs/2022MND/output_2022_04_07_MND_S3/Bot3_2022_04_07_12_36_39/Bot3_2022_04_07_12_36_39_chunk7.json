You got you got uh 40 years of of of blood samples that that you that you can go, but some of the metabolites will have been short lived. Uh there's no information on on um exposome and if something were needing gut biome or CSF uh cerebral spinal fluid uh measurement, none of that's available. So you have a slice of the bio samples that you might want to use, plus patient histories, but but it's it's an it's it's a vastly incomplete data set. Um whereas in an animal you can do or model system, I should it shouldn't necessarily be animal. Uh you have the ability to then do a little bit more targeting and then um decide what it is you want to do, but not model systems are not humans. Um yes, that's that's a problem.",

Uh and then later on I collected diet but eventually is a more sophisticated diet. For even for those of us that we have longitudinal one, it is a slice because then I I never even knew that the time of eating or circadian is really is very relevant and I started collecting that one 10 years ago and and so on. And the uh we collected samples didn't have RNA later uh in in 90s. So I sent some of my samples to one of the collaborator and he just emailed me yesterday he said that RNA is not a good quality because we didn't collect we didn't even deserve it. Uh store it very well.",

The word is importance, you all agree. We agree with that conclusion. And the number two is the ability for us to have a comprehensive models to capture the complexity of environmental factor in human is very very challenging. Uh the models whether it is fruit fly or C elegance or even animals or in vitro whether it is organoid or primary cell or stem cells has a relevance and importance uh but it will not capture the whole things.",
