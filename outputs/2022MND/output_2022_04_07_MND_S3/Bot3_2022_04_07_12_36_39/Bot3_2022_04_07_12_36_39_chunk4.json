Um, you know, as your friendly neighborhood neuro imager, a lot of the stuff that I do clinically is purely associative, right? You know, Dr. Keshavarian will come to my, you know, reading room and they'll say what's going on and I'd be like, this is probably related to this, but it's only associated. I'm going to give you a clinical differential. Um, science is a little bit more not tolerant of um, the sort of uncertainties. And so how do we design experimental systems? How do we design um, experiments themselves to start to tease apart some of those, you know, intrinsic variances and fluctuations.",

            "transcript": "So, you know what's really so there are like there are methodological templates to do this, you know, in a very high throughput fashion. So, you know, ostensibly what you could do is you can take human derived IPSCs, derive them into say neurons. And then you can put them into a very well described, well characterized like microfluidic system and you can just pulse through and do this massively parallel and measure all the analytes, all of the outcomes for that. The big question though is then somebody in study section is going to say, well that is not an accurate representation of the human brain or a vertebrate brain because how do you account for neuroal interactions? How do you account for synaptic interactions? How do you start to account for, you know, this new idea that it's not just chemical synapses, it's electrical synapses. So how do you recapitulate those very complex network interactions? So then you're stuck having to do this in an actual model. Mice are expensive, housing is expensive. You know, you can do it for like 20, but then when you start thinking about I need to do this for a thousands, that gets really, really crazy, really, really fast. Um, hey, so this is like the common, you know, this is the frustration and the the roadblock that I've come up against is, you know, we need to very at the very bare minimum start to describe some of these things at a foundational level. Then I write that exact grant to the NH and they say like, well we're not interested in description, we want a mechanism. And you're like, you show me a mechanism. There's no way to do this unless we actually even understand what it looks like to start with. So to me that's the the common tension with a lot of this, especially, you know, as a physician scientist, my my whole idea is I want to translate this. Like how do we help people? Um, don't get me wrong, I love the fundamental stuff. I'll I'll dig in the sandbox with all of y'all, but um, ultimately, how do we translate this into clinical populations?",

            "transcript": "I think one of something that could be really cool, but also has a lot of limitations would be like a rodent model with microdialysis sampling simultaneously of the brain and gut, looking and then like coupling that directly online to a small molecule separation so that you can screen and monitor over time a bunch of different small molecules um simultaneously. And so something like that would be really interesting, but I think that the challenge with any of like the microdialysis sampling, microfluidic techniques, all of these things is that it's not something that you just jump into. Like it's something that you build yourself oftentimes and that's hard to translate into like the clinic or into, you know, biology labs or whatever. So I don't really think that answers my question, but poses maybe more. Like how do we translate these things, these devices, these platforms that we develop into different labs across, you know, the world.",

            "transcript": "When I think of environmental exposures in my work and what affects, they definitely affect the oral microbiome, what people eat, um, the access that they have to dental care, um, whether they are a caregiver of somebody with, you know, a chronic and severe illness. Those are all kind of exposures that I don't think you can capture in a model necessarily, but definitely impact the microbiome. Um, so I think that that's a real challenge and then looking at that in relationship with the host genetics um because there are people who are predisposed to say periodontal disease which is um, you know, definitely a microbial has a microbial ideology, but there's a there may be a genetic predisposition. So I think that that kind of complicated interplay of all those factors makes modeling really challenging.",
