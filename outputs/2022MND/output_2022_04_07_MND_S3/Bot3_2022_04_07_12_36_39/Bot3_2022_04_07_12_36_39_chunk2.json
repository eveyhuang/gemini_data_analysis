And after 10 years, I went back as a visiting professor in Iran and the diseases that were not there, started to show up, Parkinson, MS and Crohn's and so on. And therefore I was convinced that is environment because in 10 years you are not going to change your gene pool of 15 years. I was convinced that environmental factor move the genotype to phenotype.",

And because my research training was inflammation and like a carpenter that see everything either as a nail or hammer, I thought all the diseases are inflammation. At the time which was very controversial, now pretty much most people agree on it. But I ask myself, how does environmental factor interact with the host.",

It's about 350 square meter bigger than the the American football field, bigger than a swimming and so on. And and also many environmental factor at the time was specifically was into diet, so it goes through the GI track.",

But my old boss said that if I want to ruin my career, I should look at the bacteria because he said only 10% of the bacteria can be identified through the culture and people that they dabble in that they lost their career. He advised me not to do it till there is a technique that come along and non culture to do it. And I was always mindful of that. But I said whatever is in inside the the gut, if the barrier function is appropriate, then it can act as a partition. Therefore my readout was barrier function from 80s in 2000 till I became aware of the non culture the DNA based technique that we got into the microbites. And initially obviously was GI and then I become agnostic and because all diseases and I have a bias and environmental factor promote non communicable diseases through the GI as a gateway and microbiota as a middle man. I consider microbiota as a canary in the mind. It just reflect the good or hostile environment that impacted by the background gene and environment, not the cause of the disease, but it could be mediator of the disease.",

Um, so we're we're really interested in considering time as a variable and in a circadian system, the clock in your brain synchronizes to the external environment, but you also have molecular clocks in every other tissue, um, including in your gut and in your liver, um, and in other metabolic tissues. And what's fascinating is that the clock in the brain can really only be reset by light inputs, but clocks in peripheral tissues can be reset by all kinds of additional cues.",

            "transcript": "And what this can lead to is circadian desynchrony where basically different tissues tell different times. So in an ideally entrained organism, the circadian clock, the circadian molecular transcriptional translational feedback loop is telling the same time in every different organ system. So all of the organ systems are temporarily coordinated with each other. But if you do things like eat in the middle of the night, drink caffeine, use drugs of abuse, use pharmaceutical drugs, um, you know, eliminate your microbiome, take antibiotics, um, you can provide these new entrainment cues for your gut.",

            "transcript": "Um, and that can basically reset the clock in your gut and reset the clock in your liver, um, and basically entrain it against the brain clock. And we do know that when you got this like long term decoupling of circadian clocks between organ systems, especially between the brain and metabolic organ systems, you can get metabolic syndrome, you can get weight gain, um, and so, and then you can get, you know, the more obvious circadian disruptions of things like sleep disturbance, which can also then feed back to just continuing to decouple circadian systems further. Um, so one of the things that that my lab is interested in doing is trying to understand interactions between um aging, food timing, um, and behavior using drosophila because we can manipulate their genetics and their environment so easily for large cohorts of flies.",

Uh, and we're interested in understanding how manipulating their circadian environment um after traumatic injury influences outcomes. And one of the outcomes that we are interested in is looking at formation of um protein aggregates in their brains as well as um degeneration and then subsequent recovery of um axonal damage. And we're manipulating things like their light cycle and their feeding cycle after injury, um to try to understand, you know, does any of this matter um in recovery from this kind of, you know, severe damage.",
