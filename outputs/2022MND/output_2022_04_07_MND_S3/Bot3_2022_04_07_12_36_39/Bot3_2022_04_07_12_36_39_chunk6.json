So I think that's that's a a good approach to use when you have something like an exposome data set, a very big environmental data set combined with a very big say microbiome data set. Um so so very nice way to analyze it and and kind of um characterize associations between the data set.",

            "transcript": "That's really um very hopeful to me that there are analytic approaches to like multiomic and huge data sets. I think we still have to address, I would also fall in the exposome camp, but with some considerations. One is like obviously you can't gather every piece of data about the exposome, so how do you decide which which pieces of data you're going to collect. That's one. And then the second I think issue is measurement. So we already talked about, you know, gathering dietary data. We don't really look at timing or um measuring whatever it is that whatever social determinant of health you're wanting to look at. I think that also um poses a challenge.",

What do you think especially for you guys basic science people that we get knowledge bedside that exposome to the lab because we we discuss you say that these all models and uh it may not reflect what's happening in the real world. Now you get the data from the real world which is very hard to uh assign causal link or one to one and that is the kind of things in the lab we can do. If the information on environments and the role of environment in gut brain access to the exosome uh is get a and you have a very good um network analysis and modeling and a bunch of stuff, how and if you want to know which one is more relevant and how it does impact the microbiota and interaction, how do you suggest to come up with the design of a studies whether it is in a fruit fly or C elegance or in in rodents.",

            "transcript": "I mean a big challenge in in fly research and I think one that people are are making strides in and I I see the same problems in rodent research is creating environmentally rich paradigms in which to investigate our outcomes. So, you know, um a mouse in the wild doesn't live in a plastic box and eat a high fat western diet equivalent. Um, you know, uh there are a number of studies that show that, you know, while mice are nocturnal in lab conditions, many mice in naturally occurring um like field conditions are actually diurnal or crepuscular um for example. So, you know, we're when we conduct these kinds of basic science experiments, we're doing them in such stripped down environments that we're we're oversimplifying to something that's not representative anymore. Um, but trying to figure out which which factors to add back in because obviously we can't just like keep fruit flies, I don't know, in our backyards because that's too variable. Um, you know, is is a challenge I think, you know, as people have mentioned like which which factors do we track while, you know, when it comes to the lab, we can control the factors, but we have to pick which factors to add in and how to control them.",

            "transcript": "Well, so actually when Annika was talking, I was thinking about something that I was a part of for my PhD research and that was developing a system that was capable of monitoring neurotransmitters on animal. And so like an animal in its natural environment, not the rat in the box, but like a sheep out in the field interacting with other sheep. Um, so I think that there are ways to do that, but it's it's that balance between the variability of the data not being able to tell us about some of these specific mechanisms when we open it up to, you know, all of the different rats in their environment outside versus the more controlled, okay, we have this feeding schedule, we have this light dark cycle and this is the single thing that or, you know, single tiny host of things that we're trying to manipulate and look at these specific neurotransmitters or what have you, biomarkers. I do think that it's an interesting and again, it's that translational jump from small animal models like the fruit flies fruit flies and the C elegans to the larger animal rodents to humans and you know, how do we make that process a little bit easier because I think that it would be really nice if we could do all of our research in C elegans and fruit flies from a practical and ethical standpoint. But I don't think that we're there yet.",
