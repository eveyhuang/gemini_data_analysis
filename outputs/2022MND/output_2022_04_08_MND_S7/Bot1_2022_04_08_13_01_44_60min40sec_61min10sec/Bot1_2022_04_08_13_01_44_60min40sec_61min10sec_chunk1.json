Uh others I think I'm meeting for the first time, but my name is Emily Balskus. I'm a chemical biologist and from this perspective, you know, my perspective on this this uh topic we're going to discuss is sort of from the perspective of um somebody who studies um microbial metabolites is very interested in discovery of new molecules and and is they actually is uh trying to work on a lot of these types of questions. You know, how do we actually go from an interesting hit um we might get out of metabolic profiling, metabolomics and then try to figure out what's actually happening. Um, so uh I'm really I think this this is an a really important problem. It's a big bottleneck in multiomics research um and so I'm really curious to hear what you all think um about about this uh topic.",

I remember back 20 years ago, 2000, 2001, there were four of us in the US thinking about metabolomics. We went to NIEHS, we told them, look, measuring metabolites is a no-brainer, something important coming up. Yes, the genome and the proteome and what have you, but the essence, the metabolome is your readout is the classical things you measure clinically in in a in a hospital setting, that's what you measure.",

I started the metabolomic society, I led five large consortia for NIH, including a large gut microbiome initiative and Alzheimer's disease, defining gut brain access chemically, what are these products of the gut microbiome? Can we bring the collective power of metabolomics, lipidomics, a whole area of eight 10 platforms to teach us something about metabolites of the bacteria and by the way, how do we know that these are influenced or directly produced? In some cases we do know, right? In some cases we don't. We are measuring a thousand, 2,000 things in the blood and we are asking which of these metabolites come from the food we ingest, the exposome and which are gut microbiome derived and I can tell you a good percent of what we measure in the blood certainly is bacterial products. How do we know? We know from a whole body of literature.",
