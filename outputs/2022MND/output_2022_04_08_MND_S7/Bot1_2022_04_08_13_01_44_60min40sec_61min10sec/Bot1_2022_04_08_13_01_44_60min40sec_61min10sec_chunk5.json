This is something my lab has worked on for a while now and it's hard. I mean there's particularly for molecules that may be made by many bacterial species and you may have different this is a theme that's come up in some other discussions too. You you might have different organisms responsible for a specific function and so if you develop an inhibitor targeted towards one of those organisms, will it be broadly applicable. Um uh it's you you can't right? And so there's I think there's room for creativity. Um uh like I mean you mentioned um small molecule sequestering agents and and um you know it's again probably like interesting chemical innovation could be done there to try to to make that technology more specific um or um suited to specific types of of of molecules.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, one other thing I wanted to just see what people thought about a sort of, what do you think about the importance of actual to have target identification within the microbiome? So that's gets back to kind of, you know, something Elizabeth was talking about with screening of things like GPCRs and and you know, finding targets can be powerful, I think, because then you you can actually start to loop into things like human genetics and like looking at at at different um uh people who have, you know, genetic diversity in in targets of microbial metabolites to try to better understand whether you know, a role for um a molecule in in disease biology might make sense. Um you know, JP you'd mentioned choline. I mean, I think one of the things that's kind of been tricky about about the products of choline metabolism is that nobody's really been able to identify a target for the end product that's been, you know, the product that was identified in metabolomic studies and it's been such an, you know, intense area of research. Um I that you know, and I know from trying to to, you know, interact with um uh people on kind of more of the the um drug development side of things that, you know, without a without a a mechanism, they're kind of hesitant to want to move forward with a microbiome targeted therapy. So yeah, are there better methods for actually doing target ID or or doing getting generating hypotheses for mechanisms more quickly.",

            "transcript": "Yeah. Without it without getting there to the to the enzymes and the proteins, we are short. Clearly connecting the dots, right? Is the action, is the action. These are partners, yeah. I wonder if we can like explore like study design. Calvin had mentioned like oh so do animal models or randomized control and Rima you mentioned an N of one. So studying a single individual and I'm wondering if given our um we know that the dynamics are so fluid and so unique to the individual for the human metabolome, is there a way to design an effective study that I don't know, I'm just like off the top of my head like we have nested studies but we're we're focused on a single individual, you know. Big and we know there are few people who are really doing this in a beautiful way. They load themselves with all kinds of monitors and they are getting metabolic profile and they we're starting to do some of this, right? And and learn about the individual. But clearly an N of one I I need to know what's good for me. At the end I want to know who is like me, right? Generally, but the focus is an N of one, right? You are right. an N of one where I can study this dynamics and what the where am I at different points and stages, right? Throughout and maybe at the end if I do not have a sensor that I can implant, right? Or that I can attach, maybe I can take a drop of blood on a filter paper to make this feasible, practical. Where am I going to go? I'm not going to go to a lab and get a blood specimen every hour or every day. It's not feasible. So as a community, we are also trying to say, can we make this something similar to inborn errors of metabolism where they, you know, every child who is born, they get a drop of blood, it gets on a filter paper, it goes to a lab, you get a read, are you susceptible to develop a disease, right? If you have a metabolic aberrancy based on your metabolic profile. So if we want to scale this and learn about the N of one and in real time, we're going to be sampling samples longitudinally. How do we do it, you know, is a big question. We are we are on it. We are thinking and doing something about it. We're not there yet. Yeah, it would be easy if I can drop a piece of blood, put it in filter paper, put it in desiccant, wait for an end of the week, I send 500 samples, yes. It teaches me about my metabolism, the the range. It also teaches me about my gut microbiome. Is there a dysbiosis? Yeah, we do cover quite a bit of metabolites of the gut, right? Um I can change my lifestyle and try to see if I can fix it. I can take probiotics, I can change my diet. Yes, I can try to do something that might work for me. That's the ultimate goal. I think an N of one is the ultimate goal. We are making our way. We're not there.",

We we can we can kind of it has a direction like metabolite first and then phenotype instead of the other way around. I think it can it can help us learn something about causality.",

Could I have gleaned something early? And if there are metabolites indicators of gut dysbiosis early on, maybe that gives me a bit of an ammunition and I say, look, these changes in the gut microbiome did not happen after the disease. They happened way early on. At least I'm not confirming, yes, but I'm I'm adding to the pipeline of ammunition. Is this relevant, right? Does it relate and is it positive, yeah?",
