And the other aspect is that we we're just doing human evolution analysis, how human adapt to diet during evolution. That's what I'm doing in the lab.",

I think the the the topic of this session is exactly what we are struggling with now. We brought eight platforms, 10 platforms of metabolomics. We profile the whole area of individuals from large studies in Alzheimer's, depression, anxiety, we are connecting dots and we discovered there are certain metabolites that correlate with cognition, cognitive decline, brain imaging changes or with mood changes.",

To be able to track this in real time throughout the day is is hugely, of course, my goodness, I'm going to learn so much more about my metabolism after I eat, before I eat, after I exercise, right? And end of one over time is a big deal and that's where we need to go. We're not there yet. But we are trying to come up with continuous monitors, you guys are whoever is developing sensors is a great idea. If I have a glucose sensor and I do, right? My glucose started to go up, I immediately didn't want to be prediabetic, I want to stay normal as long as I can, if I can, then I have a glucose monitor that tells me something about every minute of the day I I have it, I I know exactly. Why not more sensors? Why not many more sensors?",
