Things from all genetic studies out there, did the metabolome highlight? And we call this approach the metabolome informed the genome, right? Or the pharmacometabolomics informed pharmacogenomics. So you go back and say now my goodness, I can look at 500,000 people. I don't need to profile them. I already got my my input from the metabolism.

Um, I'm wondering about um what are so we there's so many metabolites. I think one of the questions is how do you triage? Um how do you we talked about it takes so much effort to go down these mechanistic pathways. Um and how do you um how do you decide, you know, like which which to to to target first and we've talked a little bit about but um like GPCR screens and others, but what are some of the others I guess is what I was thinking about. What are some of the like other high throughput screening in terms of targets that we can be thinking about. Um this also reminds me a little bit of um and Emily you might be able to provide better description of this, but um I remember in grad school like every time we made a new molecule we'd send it to the NIH for for screening of things. And I don't exactly know I was too um I was just focused on making the molecule. I'm not exactly sure what happened on the back end, but I I wonder if there's any analogies here to um the high throughput screening methodologies, but more importantly I think how you target what those targets are. Like what are what are you high throughput screening? Um we're doing this right now with like a single cell type that has a particular protein that we're interested in. Um that you means you do this for every cell type? Do you do it for um like the GPCR screens? Like what are how do we approach this? I think is a question that I'm really interested in because then we can look at hundreds and thousands of molecules and and then triage from there so that we know like that might be worth putting in all of this effort to deconstruct the mechanism. Um and then be able to to build from there. So I guess I'm just wondering if people have thoughts on what what what are the targets in that way that we might be able to screen for. Does that make sense?",

So it seems like two very different direction. So one of them is to like identify all of the metabolites, right? But so many of them we don't we don't quite know in detail your functions. On the other hand is, you know, we can actually um perhaps you know identify some of the key elements. Yeah, I mean what is everybody's thoughts, right? I think it's it's two different ways of tackle the problem. Sometimes also depending on the resources, time, efforts, right?",
