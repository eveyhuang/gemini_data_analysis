Calvin had mentioned like oh so do animal models or randomized control and Rima you mentioned an N of one. So studying a single individual and I'm wondering if given our um we know that the dynamics are so fluid and so unique to the individual for the human metabolome, is there a way to design an effective study that I don't know, I'm just like off the top of my head like we have nested studies but we're we're focused on a single individual, you know. Big and we know there are few people who are really doing this in a beautiful way. They load themselves with all kinds of monitors and they are getting metabolic profile and they we're starting to do some of this, right? And and learn about the individual. But clearly an N of one I I need to know what's good for me. At the end I want to know who is like me, right? Generally, but the focus is an N of one, right? You are right. an N of one where I can study this dynamics and what the where am I at different points and stages, right? Throughout and maybe at the end if I do not have a sensor that I can implant, right? Or that I can attach, maybe I can take a drop of blood on a filter paper to make this feasible, practical. Where am I going to go? I'm not going to go to a lab and get a blood specimen every hour or every day. It's not feasible. So as a community, we are also trying to say, can we make this something similar to inborn errors of metabolism where they, you know, every child who is born, they get a drop of blood, it gets on a filter paper, it goes to a lab, you get a read, are you susceptible to develop a disease, right? If you have a metabolic aberrancy based on your metabolic profile. So if we want to scale this and learn about the N of one and in real time, we're going to be sampling samples longitudinally. How do we do it, you know, is a big question. We are we are on it. We are thinking and doing something about it. We're not there yet. Yeah, it would be easy if I can drop a piece of blood, put it in filter paper, put it in desiccant, wait for an end of the week, I send 500 samples, yes. It teaches me about my metabolism, the the range. It also teaches me about my gut microbiome. Is there a dysbiosis? Yeah, we do cover quite a bit of metabolites of the gut, right?

And I don't exactly know I was too um I was just focused on making the molecule. I'm not exactly sure what happened on the back end, but I I wonder if there's any analogies here to um the high throughput screening methodologies, but more importantly I think how you target what those targets are. Like what are what are you high throughput screening? Um we're doing this right now with like a single cell type that has a particular protein that we're interested in. Um that you means you do this for every cell type? Do you do it for um like the GPCR screens? Like what are how do we approach this? I think is a question that I'm really interested in because then we can look at hundreds and thousands of molecules and and then triage from there so that we know like that might be worth putting in all of this effort to deconstruct the mechanism.
