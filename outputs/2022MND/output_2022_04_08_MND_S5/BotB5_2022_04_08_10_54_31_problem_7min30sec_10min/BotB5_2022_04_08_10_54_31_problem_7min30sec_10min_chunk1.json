Uh so in my lab we have uh kind of like two big directions. One of them is to probe synaptic neurochemistry uh where we are developing a nanoscale electrode uh that can be positioned at synapses using scanning electrochemical microscopy. Uh we also have a second direction where we are developing uh implantable electrodes um for sensing um selective uh group of neurochemicals that are involved in cognitive activities. I call them like glad, like a GL means glutamate, A means acetocoling. Uh D like dopamine. Um so uh yeah, so so this is like you know another big direction and we also have interest in Alzheimer's disease as well as Parkinson's disease. Uh where my long-term passion is really to explore the effect of environmental pollutants on the brain activity. Um yeah, I haven't taught like environmental chemistry for several years at UIUC, which is a fantastic experience. So yeah, the class has grew a lot.
