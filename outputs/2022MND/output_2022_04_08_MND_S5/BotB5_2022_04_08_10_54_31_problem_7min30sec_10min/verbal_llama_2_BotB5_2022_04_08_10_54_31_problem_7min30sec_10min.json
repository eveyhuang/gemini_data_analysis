Then you've got immune barriers primarily IGA dependent and then you have got the structure barrier which is intestinal epithelial and primarily through the paracellular path that between the epithelial cells that's regulated by apical junctional complex that can be uh those protein can be disrupted and cause a leach and that disruption is either through oxidative stress or uh cyto compact which clearly get uh disrupted or regulated by bacterial product.

Uh subsequently couple of studies shows that in human there is in Parkinson they have got disruption of intestinal barrier. We subsequently showed it in animal model of Parkinson is primarily uh that there is disruption of intestinal barrier oxidative stress and that appears to be TLR4 pathway because in TLR4 knockout mice the barrier was protected. Um and more recently we haven't published that we are using organoids uh from patient with Parkinson and control and uh we use um dextran and also we stained for uh tight junctional protein which by the way in human tissue we show that are disrupted. In organoids from patient with Parkinson they have uh disruption of the barrier and disruption of the tight junctional protein. ",
