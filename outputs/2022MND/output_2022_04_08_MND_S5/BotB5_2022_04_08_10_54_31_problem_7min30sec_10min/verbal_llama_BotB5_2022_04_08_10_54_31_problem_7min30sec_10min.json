And I said, should be okay, there is a control. He said, no, the uh the 16S has no internal control and for the first time I realized that the uh amplicon base and as we speak is still the case, there is no internal uh control.

For it can be all over in the colon and you can measure it and you look at the urine and higher the um levels in the urine leakier the intestine is. Uh and then through the immunohisto chemistry uh we showed that is associated with oxidative stress. We define it with the uh the positive nitrotyrosine and also uh penetration of um E coli associated LPS in the tissue as well as uh increase LPS binding protein in the serum. Uh subsequently couple of studies shows that in human there is in Parkinson they have got disruption of intestinal barrier. We subsequently showed it in animal model of Parkinson is primarily uh that there is disruption of intestinal barrier oxidative stress and that appears to be TLR4 pathway because in TLR4 knockout mice the barrier was protected. Um and more recently we haven't published that we are using organoids uh from patient with Parkinson and control and uh we use um dextran and also we stained for uh tight junctional protein which by the way in human tissue we show that are disrupted.
