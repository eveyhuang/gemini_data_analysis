            "transcript": "The um that is something I have been studying since early 80s. Um and the reason was yesterday I told in our group I always my uh idea was that environmental factor is very relevant in non communicable disease and the gateway is the GI trash because it's the largest interface and the middle man is bacteria and I thought that the real gateway is is barrier function. And uh and and in fact it may be true because there are so many layer of intestinal barrier that to me indicate that our host knows how important it is. You have a physical barrier which is the non steer water layer and mucus which by the way the mucus can be disrupted because of the bacteria, there are a bunch of bacteria that are mucolytic. Then you've got immune barriers primarily IGA dependent and then you have got the structure barrier which is intestinal epithelial and primarily through the paracellular path that between the epithelial cells that's regulated by apical junctional complex that can be uh those protein can be disrupted and cause a leach and that disruption is either through oxidative stress or uh cyto compact which clearly get uh disrupted or regulated by bacterial product.",

            "transcript": "And you can imagine if there is disruption of the barrier, the access of luminal factors in the gut for example bacterial product would have far easier access uh to the systemic circulation and the brain and if it is a tighter that um access is going to be less. Typically we use endotoxin such as LPS as a marker of the systemic leak but there are more bacterial product than the endotoxin. We are recently for like many others you are looking at the TMA and TMAO uh that is uh been shown to be increased in both Alzheimer and uh in fact there is a study we are just going to get published very shortly that uh it's interesting you talked about the MSA. Uh one of the MSA patients was by statistically outlier and I and my student removed it and I said let's see why is that the case and that was the only MSA MSC that was outlier. The rest were MSP looks as if that sub even subset of MSA have a different bacterial product.",

            "transcript": "So Stephanie, you asked, you know, if there's similarities between AD and PD in the in the bacterial profiles. And I think Ali gave us a lot to think about. You know, the bottom line is we don't, this is still pretty new for at least on the neurodegenerative disease side. Parkinson's is a bit farther ahead, I think, than Alzheimer's disease. But I think it opens up a lot that we can talk about, right? Which is, are there general principles? How would we figure those out? You know, what are the potential shared mechanisms? What are are there different mechanisms? So I'd love to hear what other people are thinking about um about this topic.",

In fact we've got as many viruses especially bacteriophages than bacteria and those viruses can impact the bacteria through the bacteriophages. For and the reason we are not talking about that because now for the bacteria you will do 16S which you can do it for less than $20 and uh you have got all the bioinformatics is free you can download it. For the others you have to do um uh the shotgun which is still expensive and annotation is not very good. And then we are talking about the composition which is important but it is not as maybe functionally relevant. We know who is there. Now we have to understand what are they doing? That is the function and metabolomics which uh Rima mentioned and again is uh Stephanie you are in in good in good shape. You are going to collaborate lots of people would love to have proteomics and um and lipidomics and so on because that is what going to answer the role of bacteria in brain disease.",

Like Dr. Ali was mentioning about leaking. So so does this leaking also both happens in AD and PD uh like AD and Parkinson's disease are they like similar level? But certainly I think this um um oxidative stress, right? Do occurs in both diseases.",

            "transcript": "The um paper in 2011, the first author is Dr. Forsight uh shows that in patient with Parkinson disease naive, no constipation or no medication have disruption of intestinal barrier. The way we do it, we do it with a sugar test. Uh we uh give patients or in animals a cocktail of poly absorb sugar which is manitol uh lactulose and sucralose and sucralose is is a modified sucrose that is got a chloride next to it and the benefit of it is neither human or bacteria can ferment it. For it can be all over in the colon and you can measure it and you look at the urine and higher the um levels in the urine leakier the intestine is. Uh and then through the immunohisto chemistry uh we showed that is associated with oxidative stress. We define it with the uh the positive nitrotyrosine and also uh penetration of um E coli associated LPS in the tissue as well as uh increase LPS binding protein in the serum. Uh subsequently couple of studies shows that in human there is in Parkinson they have got disruption of intestinal barrier. We subsequently showed it in animal model of Parkinson is primarily uh that there is disruption of intestinal barrier oxidative stress and that appears to be TLR4 pathway because in TLR4 knockout mice the barrier was protected. Um and more recently we haven't published that we are using organoids uh from patient with Parkinson and control and uh we use um dextran and also we stained for uh tight junctional protein which by the way in human tissue we show that are disrupted. In organoids from patient with Parkinson they have uh disruption of the barrier and disruption of the tight junctional protein.",
