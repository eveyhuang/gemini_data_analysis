Um, it's hard to control for batch effects, it's hard to control for timing. You know, even in some of the most rigorous studies like the HMP from the NIH, it's you know, even if you compare 16S versus metagenomics, you get wildly different answers, which makes, you know, the scientist in me very specious about that data. But the data is like super compelling. Like Ali's group has shown many of these association, Barge group has shown many, many of these associations for PD or for AD. And you know, I'm I'm a systems guy and so the thing that makes me really I I mentioned this within another session with Ellie yesterday is, you know, what's the organizing biophysical precept behind all of this?",

Unfortunately many neurologists do not and partly because of the overlap. the the idea of what people talk about brain first or body first. But to answer the Stephanie, there is no if or doubt about it Stephanie that brain impact microbiota that patients that they become depressed or animal model that become depressed or brain injury in whether is in monkey or in animals or as well as in human PTSD and all of those things can do it. There is no doubt that is a the gut brain access is not single path is a bidirectional path and in fact it can create a vicious cycle. the question is when is going to start. Now, I trained my postgraduate at Guys with Start with where the Parkinson uh uh practice and one of my fun during the lunchtime was to go to the library and read the original uh description Addison Sterling and Parkinson very humbling. The Parkinson William Parkinson is exceptional clinician the description of his phenotype without having MRI or JP that didn't have you and it was exceptional. But the point is Parkinson I think is a syndrome. It's not a single disease and therefore there are going to be type of patients that maybe start from the gut, they some come from the brain, but the creation of the vicious cycle that is going to sustain it. I I I know that my view is is a no no in a study section. I get irritated when people say is it a uh trigger. I said why should I care whether is a trigger or is perpetuated because you need to",
