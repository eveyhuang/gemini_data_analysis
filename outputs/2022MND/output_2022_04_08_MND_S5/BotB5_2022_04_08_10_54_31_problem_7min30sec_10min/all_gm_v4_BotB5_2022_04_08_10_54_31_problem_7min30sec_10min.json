You have a physical barrier which is the non steer water layer and mucus which by the way the mucus can be disrupted because of the bacteria, there are a bunch of bacteria that are mucolytic. Then you've got immune barriers primarily IGA dependent and then you have got the structure barrier which is intestinal epithelial and primarily through the paracellular path that between the epithelial cells that's regulated by apical junctional complex that can be uh those protein can be disrupted and cause a leach and that disruption is either through oxidative stress or uh cyto compact which clearly get uh disrupted or regulated by bacterial product.",
