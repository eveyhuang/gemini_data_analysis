And we put together to publish it and my uh colleague Dr. Mutlu uh was my fellow told me said by the way, do you know that uh we ran the samples for the Parkinson in one run and we ran the control the other run. And I said, should be okay, there is a control. He said, no, the uh the 16S has no internal control and for the first time I realized that the uh amplicon base and as we speak is still the case, there is no internal uh control. And run to run is significant. Uh and people don't talk about it.
