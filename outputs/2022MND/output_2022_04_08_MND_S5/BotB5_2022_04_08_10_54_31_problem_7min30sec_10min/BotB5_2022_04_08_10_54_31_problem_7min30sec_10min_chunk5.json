But for Parkinson, several good longitudinal studies, the one in Honolulu, that showed that patients that self reported constipation,",

Dr. Shannon and I published a paper that alpha aggregate in the sigmoid colon of patients with Parkinson disease, we identified two to five years prior to diagnosis of Parkinson prior to having a symptoms of Parkinson suggesting that at least the aggregate can happen in the gut before you have enough neurodegeneration in the brain to have motor symptoms. And the way we find out these are the patient or just only three patient that I happen to do colonoscopy and I happen to take the biopsy because of the polyp and then subsequently diagnosed with Parkinson at Rush. Subsequently the French group published the same things, but I think they had something like 20 patients. for there is rational to look at the gut for Parkinson and Alzheimer for the symptoms point of view, but again we tell you causality.",

Um, right, so the idea of antibiofilm agent would be to disperse um the the biofilm rather than um to kill the bacteria in the biofilm so the body can either, you know, clear them uh in in a way that it wouldn't be able to access them via its own immune response when they're kind of buried in this biofilm um sedentary layers.",
