I can tell you same kind of things is true in metabolic syndrome, in obesity, in diabetes, in inflammatory bowel disease and there are bunch of people have none of those disease and their microbiota cluster with those guys. Therefore having that would not make you have a disease. I think it make you more susceptible to get the disease if you are unlucky.
