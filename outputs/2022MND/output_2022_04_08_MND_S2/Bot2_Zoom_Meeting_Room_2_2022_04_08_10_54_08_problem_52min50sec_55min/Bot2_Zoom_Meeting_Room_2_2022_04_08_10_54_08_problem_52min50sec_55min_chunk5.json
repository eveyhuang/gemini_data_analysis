And we didn't want it that way when we designed it, we wanted just one donor to keep things more systematic, but I would say we got lucky because I think the fact that we added two donors increased the diversity and our maintenance donor actually happened to be a donor that had very high diversity if you looked on the graphs.",

So each patient actually received microbio from two different donors because the high dose was from one donor and the maintenance dose was from another donor. And we didn't want it that way when we designed it, we wanted just one donor to keep things more systematic, but I would say we got lucky because I think the fact that we added two donors increased the diversity and our maintenance donor actually happened to be a donor that had very high diversity if you looked on the graphs.",
