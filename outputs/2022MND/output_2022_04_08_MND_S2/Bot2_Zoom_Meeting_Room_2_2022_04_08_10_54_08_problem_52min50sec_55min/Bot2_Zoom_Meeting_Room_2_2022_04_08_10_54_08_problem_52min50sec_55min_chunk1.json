Just tell you that I'm an environmental engineer by training but I have always worked with microbes and how microbes interact with each other and with their environment. And now this is a topic a very important topic for my gut microbiome research. And now I will pass it to Carolina and after you introduce yourself, please pass it to someone else so we know who's speaking if that's okay.",

And I would say the the spin that we take on the microbiota is to try to understand how the abiotic environment that is in the gut affects the microbiota and this is important because all the diseases that we know that happen in the gut affects the gut environment whether it's the temperature because you have a fever or local changes say that a tumor will have a different temperature than the rest of the environment. So we take a multi scale approach to try to understand from the single cell level to the organismal level how these physical changes affect the microbiota and therefore host health. And I'll pass it on to Dave.",
