My own observations in scaling up data is that the metabolism data in the blood, the information about metabolites in the blood hugely inform about things that that happen in the brain from cognition to imaging to degeneration, there is a sensing mechanism that goes from the blood to the brain and it is phenomenal, more so informative maybe than CSF. It's amazing how much there is a connectivity, right, that predicts. The bacteria produces the bacteria metabolizes some of what we eat clearly and loudly completes our metabolism and we complete the metabolism of bacteria.",

Yes, we know our biochemistry, we can work with a set of metabolites that fits biochemistry we know something about. We are trying to understand the synergy between bacteria and humans, co metabolism, we are trying to model it and we are trying to understand and connect the dots to the brain.

And um and that's just a really hard um loop to figure out and to tease apart cause and effect and but you know I feel like we've in the realm of um what's important on the humans versus microbiome we've we've now become really focused on like the microbiome impacting everything and and I really feel like we're missing a little bit the fact that there's a huge amount that we produce too that feeds back into the microbiota. Uh and um I I think I agree that this is a super important thing to think about because we produce massive amount of things that make it to the microbiome as well.",
