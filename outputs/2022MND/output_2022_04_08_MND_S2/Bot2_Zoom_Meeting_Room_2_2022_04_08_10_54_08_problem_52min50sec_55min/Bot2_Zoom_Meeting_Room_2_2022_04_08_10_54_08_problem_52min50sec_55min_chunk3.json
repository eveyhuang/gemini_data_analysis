But currently there is nothing like uh that can go all the way through the whole axis uh it doesn't exist uh with GI track uh it's specifically very challenging actually. Uh brain is easiest honestly. The brain probes they have been in the field for 50 years. So it is not even a new thing at all.",

There is always some wires like sticking out. So how you can implant it and also have the data communication circuit combined with that sensing modality. So there are a lot of progress in that field and that's great for brain.",

There are some works that they have shown that okay, let's make capsules, like a smart capsules, a smart pills that you eat and uh, you know, there are ideas actually, like calls by NIH I remember it had started like last year. Uh it has been, you know, this idea has been around actually for a long time. I remember I was a student and this smart pill thing was mentioned multiple times, but I haven't seen any really advancement and real thing rather than some passive components that they can go through and sample, sample like for example, go to intestine and sample bacteria, then the human or the subject um excrete that and then they collect the sample and do the traditional analysis, you know? But something that for example, can do all this screening, even simplest electrical screening and give the signal out because you see in our body we cannot stick wires out. That's the thing. With brain, that's as at least like to some extent you say it's here, it doesn't move, that's another big problem. It doesn't move, it is fixed. So even if there are some wires coming out, that's still okay. But how are you going to do that with, you know, with the like our stomach or our intestine, you know? Where are the wires are going to come out?",
