That's now corrected so it it can be found in humans and there is this correlate of it um decreasing in abundance as we age. And those kind of T cells are interesting because they are known to have um indirect effects if you will that are not specific to the gut. So these T cells are known to somehow also affect outcomes of arthritis, um affect outcomes of um liver disease, uh other things like that which are not specifically related to their reaction to this microbe that lives in the gut. So um that being said and uh you also mentioned inflammation. When when people think about inflammation in the gut and and and low grade inflammation, I don't I think it's it's a little bit a little bit um tenuous I suppose what what you might want to call inflammation full on inflammation because even though this microbe is well known to be naturally existing not necessarily inflammatory, it does do things immunologically that you associate with inflammation such as recruiting neutrophils um and things like that but there's no changes in the actual pathology so no pathologist will look at it and say it's inflammation. So it's almost like playing the line, straddling the line between could it go over the edge and be something really inflammatory and then maybe be linked to a distal process in the gut uh sorry in the brain. Um I don't know. I mean the like I said the if you want to call it real inflammation, nobody will agree.

Like there's just ups and downs and it's um maybe like some compensation where it doesn't always equal chronic inflammation.

But it's it's a curiosity because since there seems to be more broad interest on an infectious link, maybe not causation, maybe long-term effects and the long-term effect is something that my lab has been exploring, not necessarily to fungi specifically, just mostly because they kill mice so quickly. But looking at long-term effects that seemingly persist past after the pathogen has already been cleared. We we have been finding some of those things in the gut itself. I think that might be a good system to see whether or not there are these post recovery events that also maybe change microglia or behavior, you know, these are not experiments of course that I do, but I do plenty of gut infection models and we do know that there are long-term changes in some immune subsets for sure.

He's not uh a gut immunologist, but he has studied plenty of um uh you know, arthritis and other other conditions like that.
