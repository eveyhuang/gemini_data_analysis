That is um and actually sex differences in both of them. So related to the keynote, we are interested in sex differences in autism and we um use a mouse model of autism and then investigate um a metabolic intervention that we've been looking at. So we look anywhere from behavior to um morphology of glia in the brain and um I'm also I just put in a grant to be able to look at diversity within the microbiome from the samples that we collected from those mice.
