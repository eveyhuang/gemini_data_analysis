            "transcript": "maybe they have some inner ear defects. Well, Candida does go to the brain, but then it's cleared from the brain. Nevertheless, even when and then mostly the mice die, but you can find some strains that don't die as fast. And then they found out that some of the weirdness of the mouse behavior may have some similarities to what they call, you know, Alzheimer's. Again, it's not my field, so I'm sure those of you who study, you know, these kind of diseases will be grossly offended at at how those were dissected. I do not know. But it's it's a curiosity because since there seems to be more broad interest on an infectious link, maybe not causation, maybe long-term effects and the long-term effect is something that my lab has been exploring, not necessarily to fungi specifically, just mostly because they kill mice so quickly. But looking at long-term effects that seemingly persist past after the pathogen has already been cleared. We we have been finding some of those things in the gut itself. I think that might be a good system to see whether or not there are these post recovery events that also maybe change microglia or behavior, you know, these are not experiments of course that I do, but I do plenty of gut infection models and we do know that there are long-term changes in some immune subsets for sure.",

            "transcript": "I think it depends, well, so the one effect we're thing looking at is a cell type called gamma delta T cell. Gamma delta T cell are unconventional innate like T cell, really enigmatic, not that many people study it. But gamma delta T cell, we find that actually they can change their localization for a very long time after the insult has already been repaired. And it's insult specific. So not every microbe will or even uh inflammation event will cause this same outcome. And um I have an expert who's been studying gamma deltas basically all his life, I asked him, Emo Prince, um about whether this is also something that he's seen in gamma deltas in human condition. He's not uh a gut immunologist, but he has studied plenty of um uh you know, arthritis and other other conditions like that. And so he also believes that there are long-term changes in gamma delta T cell um he said that last maybe even over one year in human condition. So I don't think that this is actually in the literature. Uh we are writing a grant on it now to again all gut focus, but I think it is of interest because I I know there are long-term changes well past the insult has already been gone long, long, long time. The longest we have tested, I mean we don't keep mice over, you know, for a year. I haven't done that. But uh maybe that would be of interest. Now the longest we have done is 60 days after recovery. That's a long time for a mouse. That's a long time for us anyway.",

So to me, I feel that we have to believe things can be reset. I mean, right? why why why would we study biomedical research if we don't think things can be reset. So we have to believe they can. And in that case, it's it's still valid though to consider age and disease and and age and non-disease as well as what may be going on in a brand new infant or a brand new, you know, germ-free mouse that just now gets colonized.",
