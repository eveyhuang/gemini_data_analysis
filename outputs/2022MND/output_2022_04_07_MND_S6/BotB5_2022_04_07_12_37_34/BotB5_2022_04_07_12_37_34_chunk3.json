Are there are there other specific examples like that? I was just I don't know about proteobacteria if the abundance changes.",

            "transcript": "I usually focus on obesity and bacteroidities goes down typically. That's not like that's the challenge with this too. It's not um always consistent, but in at least obesity bacteroidities tends to go down and fermicutes tends to go up, but um I'm imagining that's something that like maps onto aging just for the overlapping potential inflammatory effects too. But going down that um discussion of inflammatory response, I just like I have so many questions about how that really works because for looking at diversity of community, like there are just so many changes that are happening and it doesn't always I mean I guess this connects with that correlation causation group but it just doesn't always translate to here's a dysbiosis if we want to call it that or just a difference for looking person to person or age group to age group. I don't always see that it could add up to an increase in all of the bacteria that are going to contribute to an increased inflammatory response. Like there's just ups and downs and it's um maybe like some compensation where it doesn't always equal chronic inflammation. Like I think that's coming from other sources too and maybe this is just stoking that fire but it just seems to me like there's um more of a connection with the quote unquote dysbiosis, like some sort of change from what it used to be way what the system was used to it being and then connecting more with metabolites and the response to that than it would be categorizing the types of bacteria as being LPS producing or something like that.",

            "transcript": "What about the um uh you know, the well known loss of T cells as you get older. Those are probably mainly memory cells. I'm now entering into an area that I don't know anything about. So um you immunologist correct me and jump in here but you know, could those be the type of cells that are uh some of them be type of cells that are managing the microbiome and that as you as you lose them with age, you now lose a certain control over the microbiome and that could be a component that changes the community structure. Um maybe there's also leaky gut or things like that that develop as you get older so that um even without a change in the microbiome, you have more uh microbial molecules slipping out into the circulation and having remote effects. what what do people think about those two things?",

            "transcript": "The leaky gut part is something I've heard. I I think um as something that could develop a little bit uh over age. I think I've heard that before. Um, the other the other thing you brought up was about the convergence of the T cells on into the the memory compartment. Yeah, so as we age the what we lose is our thymus output of new T cells, naive T cell. Uh what we gain or preserve are those T cells that already reacted to microbes, memory cell. So cells that react to influenza for example, you've probably been infected and so memory cells um they stay a long time and what we lose over time are naive cell.",

            "transcript": "How are they changing over age? You know, I don't know the answer actually. I don't know the answer. I know what happens from early life but I don't know very old life. So in early life, um there our bodies have different source of macrophage. There are embryonic macrophages that that live all over your body. Many tissues keep these embryonic derived macrophages forever. And the gut is different that they basically get out competed very quickly as soon as the microbes come in. They get out competed by monocyte derived macrophage. So I do know there is a pretty rapid replacement of embryonic macrophage with bone marrow conventional, you know, what we think of conventional monocyte derived macrophage in the gut, that's for sure. As far as how those change over time in old, I don't know. But but they do know that there are some macrophage subsets that are far more long lived as compared to others. And if they look at um like small small bowel transplant recipients, they can find macrophages from the donor tissue in those humans that trans that got that transplanted bowel, they can find those like a year later. So some of them do live very long time.",
