That's now corrected so it it can be found in humans and there is this correlate of it um decreasing in abundance as we age. And those kind of T cells are interesting because they are known to have um indirect effects if you will that are not specific to the gut. So these T cells are known to somehow also affect outcomes of arthritis, um affect outcomes of um liver disease, uh other things like that which are not specifically related to their reaction to this microbe that lives in the gut. So um that being said and uh you also mentioned inflammation. When when people think about inflammation in the gut and and and low grade inflammation, I don't I think it's it's a little bit a little bit um tenuous I suppose what what you might want to call inflammation full on inflammation because even though this microbe is well known to be naturally existing not necessarily inflammatory, it does do things immunologically that you associate with inflammation such as recruiting neutrophils um and things like that but there's no changes in the actual pathology so no pathologist will look at it and say it's inflammation. So it's almost like playing the line, straddling the line between could it go over the edge and be something really inflammatory and then maybe be linked to a distal process in the gut uh sorry in the brain. Um I don't know. I mean the like I said the if you want to call it real inflammation, nobody will agree.

But going down that um discussion of inflammatory response, I just like I have so many questions about how that really works because for looking at diversity of community, like there are just so many changes that are happening and it doesn't always I mean I guess this connects with that correlation causation group but it just doesn't always translate to here's a dysbiosis if we want to call it that or just a difference for looking person to person or age group to age group. I don't always see that it could add up to an increase in all of the bacteria that are going to contribute to an increased inflammatory response. Like there's just ups and downs and it's um maybe like some compensation where it doesn't always equal chronic inflammation. Like I think that's coming from other sources too and maybe this is just stoking that fire but it just seems to me like there's um more of a connection with the quote unquote dysbiosis, like some sort of change from what it used to be way what the system was used to it being and then connecting more with metabolites and the response to that than it would be categorizing the types of bacteria as being LPS producing or something like that.

There's really only one solid paper, recent paper, I guess spotting this whole idea. I think it's Nature Communications paper. Um and it wasn't it those of you who study aging and Alzheimer's or whatever in your mouse models will have far more sophisticated ways to answer the question.

Again, it's not my field, so I'm sure those of you who study, you know, these kind of diseases will be grossly offended at at how those were dissected. I do not know. But it's it's a curiosity because since there seems to be more broad interest on an infectious link, maybe not causation, maybe long-term effects and the long-term effect is something that my lab has been exploring, not necessarily to fungi specifically, just mostly because they kill mice so quickly. But looking at long-term effects that seemingly persist past after the pathogen has already been cleared. We we have been finding some of those things in the gut itself. I think that might be a good system to see whether or not there are these post recovery events that also maybe change microglia or behavior, you know, these are not experiments of course that I do, but I do plenty of gut infection models and we do know that there are long-term changes in some immune subsets for sure.

So not every microbe will or even uh inflammation event will cause this same outcome. And um I have an expert who's been studying gamma deltas basically all his life, I asked him, Emo Prince, um about whether this is also something that he's seen in gamma deltas in human condition. He's not uh a gut immunologist, but he has studied plenty of um uh you know, arthritis and other other conditions like that. And so he also believes that there are long-term changes in gamma delta T cell um he said that last maybe even over one year in human condition. So I don't think that this is actually in the literature. Uh we are writing a grant on it now to again all gut focus, but I think it is of interest because I I know there are long-term changes well past the insult has already been gone long, long, long time. The longest we have tested, I mean we don't keep mice over, you know, for a year. I haven't done that. But uh maybe that would be of interest. Now the longest we have done is 60 days after recovery.
