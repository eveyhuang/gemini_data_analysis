So we previously used a model with four antibiotics, one of them was metronidazole, but that does cross cross the blood brain barrier and can have direct effects on the brain. So then I did a follow up study without metronidazole, but it didn't have um as much of an effect on depleting the microbiome and then it actually when I put the we look at the genus level of um various bacteria when I put those side by side, I actually see this growth of all these other types of bacteria within the the gut of our mice and um so strangely like the diversity actually increased for the mice that we put onto the the three antibiotics cocktail, but when you look at the actual genera then it's um they're different populations. So it like allowed the growth of something new. So that's just a whole I could talk about that for hours and get any feedback.",

Mostly they've been thinking about IBD and other inflammatory disease. But um, I mean they're pretty straightforward studies and there are already known microbes of interest that people think about when it comes to the gut. Um, and certain cell types that may be expanded by certain microbes. So do you know if it already, you know, some it seems like a straightforward collaboration, somebody who's interested in the gut just give off the brains to somebody like you to to analyze the microglia for what the pruning you said and then it's just general appearance. I I would be surprised if some of that is not already in the literature, but but you're thinking that it's not? Like even just simple mono association studies or even studies for example, people did a lot of studies a long time ago with um IL10 knockouts because this is like the classical IBD strain. Um, kind of played to death, but for a long time Balfor Sarter built I mean built the idea about microbes and and gut inflammation built off of mono association of IL10 knockouts. So do you know if there is any literature at all about specific microbe influence on the microglia phenotypes you're describing?",

They're the ones that make the gut anaerobic. They're the ones that kind of like settle everything for for for like they're priming things. And so it's it's just I think we just have I guess to be mindful that obviously over the course of a lifespan how the immune system interacts with the with the gut microbiota and its different components is going to change along the way. And while we may want to remove or eradicate or or try to control proteobacteria later in life, it's not sure it's the type of thing that we want to do earlier in life. Um, and I think that would be that that's a type of like comparison or contrast that I think is is is interesting and to link that with the gut brain, it's probably there are some key molecules that are being produced by these microorganisms early in life that we may not need later in life or vice versa. Um, some of them missing early in life that like kind of like set us off for neuroinflammation or neurodegenerative diseases. So it's it was it was more of a comment than than anything else there.",
