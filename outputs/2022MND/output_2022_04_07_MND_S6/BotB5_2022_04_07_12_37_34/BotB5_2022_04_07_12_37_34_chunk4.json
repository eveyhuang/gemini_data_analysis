And then the adaptive will always like like just like pathogen will always have a kinetics in terms of numbers, okay, comes up and then at some point it reaches a steady state balance. And in that dynamic, some of the T cells may have potential to cause inflammation, but some of them may decide to become anti-inflammatory T cell. Those decisions may also change over time and be informed perhaps by other microbes that are there or perhaps by the innate responses that are also ongoing. Those are good questions. I don't think anybody has the answers to those precise temporal changes.",

One, it's uh people always think it's very hard to change your immune response from the gut microbiome if you are adult. If you in the young age, it's easier to change. That's one reason. The other the other thing I'm thinking is uh basically um you know, maybe the direction of the gut microbiome immune response over aging, which direction, basically who is regulate who, right? If if the fecal transplant did not uh, you know, change the the immune response, that's like will support potentially it's the you know, the change with the microbiome is from it's regulated by change of the immune response rather than the other way around.",
