Uh I um just uh just uh uh you know, from reading the literature, uh what I noticed is uh uh the community uh level characterization with the uh the microbiome from young to old it it's pretty well addressed, although they all use cross-sectional studies. One clear uh one clear trend people showed is uh uh you know, the the microbiome started with a simple community, right? And also from the beta diversity perspective, people become uh like very different um from each other at the beginning. And then over time through the adulthood, people become like more similar to each other. Uh and then when uh getting to older age, they become like uh um you know, divergence again. Uh so the the people find this uh this trends and definitely they identified a lot with this uh uh you know, specific microbiome that changed uh what's the signature in young, what's the signature of old. They have been well done. Uh and uh but there's no longitudinal study. Uh you know, people study a lot of microbiome in the 100 year old people, try to figure that things out. Uh yeah, that's that's that's like, you know, so far I know just from the microbiome perspective.",

There, you know, there's a lot of uh for for the immunological side of this, there's, you know, low grade chronic inflammation as a contributor to unhealthy aging. And there's there's some sense that the change in the microbiome may be related to that. Does anybody want to comment on that? It's not really my uh I'm not an immunologist.",

            "transcript": "These do change over time. Um there's one bug, it's kind of like Mucosal Immunology's gift in terms of mouse to how to study uh specific immune responses to specific microbiota. That bug is called SFB for segmented filamentous bacteria and it grew out of fashion a little bit in thinking about the human spectrum because they thought it wasn't present in humans. That's now corrected so it it can be found in humans and there is this correlate of it um decreasing in abundance as we age. And those kind of T cells are interesting because they are known to have um indirect effects if you will that are not specific to the gut. So these T cells are known to somehow also affect outcomes of arthritis, um affect outcomes of um liver disease, uh other things like that which are not specifically related to their reaction to this microbe that lives in the gut. So um that being said and uh you also mentioned inflammation. When when people think about inflammation in the gut and and and low grade inflammation, I don't I think it's it's a little bit a little bit um tenuous I suppose what what you might want to call inflammation full on inflammation because even though this microbe is well known to be naturally existing not necessarily inflammatory, it does do things immunologically that you associate with inflammation such as recruiting neutrophils um and things like that but there's no changes in the actual pathology so no pathologist will look at it and say it's inflammation. So it's almost like playing the line, straddling the line between could it go over the edge and be something really inflammatory and then maybe be linked to a distal process in the gut uh sorry in the brain. Um I don't know. I mean the like I said the if you want to call it real inflammation, nobody will agree. Nobody will agree that there that's inflammation because that's a pathologic state of the tissue. But if you look at the cellular changes, there are some similarities.",
