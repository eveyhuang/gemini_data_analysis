And, um, I don't remember where it was published or when it was published, but a fair amount of the carbohydrate metabolism genes found in gut bacteria are of either phage origin or transferred via phages. So very clearly in terms of like emergent properties, it's it's very clear that for example, um carbohydrate metabolism genes and and the metabolites produced are bound to have an impact on on like they're bound to impact the enteric immune system and the other thing that doesn't seem as widespread is antibiotic resistance genes.",

So I'm assuming there must be some sort of selection either from the bacteria and the phages kind of limiting that.",

So I think it's the type of thing that you would see in a coculture but you you wouldn't see I think all the spread of possible um interactions or or that or outputs.",

So that that difference in response can can come down to even a sub subcellular populations within clonal communities, yeah.",

But in terms of genes and abundance, yeah, it's 5050 bacteria and viruses and most of these viruses are phages.

So uh I didn't realize there's actually such big population of phages like co I guess coevolving with the bacteria culture and if they represent 50% so um how that I guess how that uh would uh affect the I'm thinking about the host, more the human host. Um, I guess they don't really directly interact with the human host because they cannot enter the cells, but um so is there uh yeah, so I remember Corinne mentioned is um they play a big role in this uh change is for from the bacteria.
