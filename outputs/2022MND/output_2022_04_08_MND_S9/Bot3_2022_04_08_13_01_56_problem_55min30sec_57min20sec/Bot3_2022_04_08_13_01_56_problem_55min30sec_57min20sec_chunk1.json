And so I'll get started even though I think most of you know me. I'm Rosa Krajmalnik Brown or Rosie and I am an environmental engineer by training, but I've been working on the gut microbiome for maybe 14 years. Um, I study microbial interactions, how microbes interact with each other and with their environment and I do that for environmental systems and for the gut microbiome too. And what I will do is I will pass it to Wenjing and Wenjing after you introduce yourself, pass it to someone else. Is that okay?",

So my lab, we do a lot of protein engineering and protein design. Um, so we design various um, sensors and also uh, optogenetic, cheogenetic tools to modulate the neuromodulation system. Um, currently we're most interested in the opioid signaling in the brain. Um, so I don't know very much about the microbiome, but um, I'm very interested in to see like uh, how maybe how we can maybe uh, help design certain kind of tools like for for the field. Yeah.",

I do not uh study anything with the gut. I'm learning a lot here and I'm realizing how superficial my knowledge of the gut brain interaction is uh being at this uh conference because there's so much uh to learn in in the conversations and I appreciate that. We study micro using different tools, but we also study them in different contexts in in development in uh in maturity. And now we're starting to move into even Alzheimer's disease. Uh, we study them in especially seizures and seizure disorders. Uh, we also study them at the cell cell level, so we're looking at their interactions with the vasculature as well. So anyway, I I I'll go and uh uh to to uh uh I was going to make a joke and say punish, but you know, to have a little fun since I just saw that Corinne came in, I will go ahead and pass it on to Corinne.",

One is towards the development of breath based diagnostics in in reading breath as a chemical readout of the human condition as one of three major waste streams our body utilizes. Um, and then more relevant to this uh discussion is that we also have become interested in the bioactivity of volatile metabolites and their utility in uh signaling between microbial between microbes within communities and also potentially between the microbes and their hosts.
