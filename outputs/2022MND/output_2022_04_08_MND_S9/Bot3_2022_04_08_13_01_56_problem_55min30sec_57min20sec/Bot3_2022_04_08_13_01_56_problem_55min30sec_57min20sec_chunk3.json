So that interaction I guess is more of kind of this this byproduct, it's clearly not intended to, um, but yeah, they they do interact and and I think there's a lot more that we're we're going to be finding.",

So it's like uh one to the 10 to fourth uh of fungal cells per ml of uh of uh of fecal slurry.

And so each individual cell will produce a molecule that is put out into the environment and every cell can sense the amount of that molecule in the environment. So every cell is making the signal and then when the signal gets concentrated enough, the cells sense that there's a lot of partners around and that will turn on the production of community goods.",
