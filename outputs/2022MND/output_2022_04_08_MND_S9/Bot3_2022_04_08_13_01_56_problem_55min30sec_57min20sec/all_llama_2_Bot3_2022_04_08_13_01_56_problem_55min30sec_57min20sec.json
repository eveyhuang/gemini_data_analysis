Um, I did my PhD working with bacteria that can respire chlorinated solvents and what they do is they take out the chlorines and they make these solvents not toxic anymore and this is used, this is used for bioremediation. There are cultures with these microbes. If you take the single microbe which is the alcoides and have the microbe do the the reaction which destroys this pollutant, the microbe is very slow if it's in pure culture. But if you have it in mixed culture with friends that can provide cofactors, electron donor and a few other fun things, which is how we use it in the environment, much faster.",

Archea such as methanogens, viruses with some eukaryotic viruses, but mostly oh that's supposed to say phage. Um, fungi, helmets, protists, dot dot dot other stuff too.
