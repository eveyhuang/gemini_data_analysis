They were produced uh in bacteria that were wild type, but if we remove quorum sensing, it was produced in much less abundance. Then so then um we studied these bacteria uh in the presence of their fungal target.",

We don't know if the fungus was making them necessarily, we don't know if the bacteria was making them, but that was an emergent property that they're one of these or both of these partners were producing new volatiles that could not be detected, um in in the monocultures.",

When the mutant bacteria was talking to the fungus, the conversation was different. So to like swing all the way back to your question Rosie about are there volatiles that are influencing um and might be signaling molecules um with the with the um nervous system, holy crap, I have no idea.",

But to know if that reflects actual reality in a whole physiological system, we're like so we're I don't know, I feel like a hundred steps away from figuring that out, but I'm really intrigued about that idea.",

So in cultures, sometimes in liquid media, sometimes in biofilms, sometimes in co-cultures. Um, we'll grow uh microbes and collect their spent media and expose the volatiles from that spent media to other microbes. So that those are some of our in vitro systems. We work we have worked with animal models as well. Um, where we can collect breath or other biological samples from animals and then look at the volatile metabolites that are emanated from those. And then also um directly from soils, although that's very challenging and we're working to develop techniques for that. Um, and then directly from human breaths to where we're sort of getting like a whole body readout of any volatile metabolites that we can get or from feces for instance.",

Do do they do they do things like in you know, in in what germ free mice you put in just one microbe or two microbe communities and and then measure what is being delivered in the blood/brain and because this question is talking about kind of neurodegeneration, right? I presume there'll be some emergent using using the the phrase emergent whatever volatiles or whatever. Uh, but have have have we done those kinds of studies in like mice or or can we answer that?",
