So a bacteria if it's just in monoculture with another bacteria might ramp up virulence factors that would really help it kill or out compete its competitor, but those virulence factors might also be uh immune modulators and signal to the host that it's um that that bacterium needs to be destroyed. And so that can modulate that emergent property of that particular uh competitive virulence factor being produced whether the host is there to detect that signal or not.",

Um that there's this constant communication feedback loop between between different um between the different levels and yes you can probably focus on one level and kind of like know everything about that level, but you have to consider that it's it is probably it is going to be shifted from like the level on top and the level below.

It's it will not be the same thing. Yeah. So I I can give you an example from environmental engineering. Um, I did my PhD working with bacteria that can respire chlorinated solvents and what they do is they take out the chlorines and they make these solvents not toxic anymore and this is used, this is used for bioremediation. There are cultures with these microbes. If you take the single microbe which is the alcoides and have the microbe do the the reaction which destroys this pollutant, the microbe is very slow if it's in pure culture. But if you have it in mixed culture with friends that can provide cofactors, electron donor and a few other fun things, which is how we use it in the environment, much faster.",

Prebiotics, it's it's um it's a molecule, it's a compound. It's food for these microorganisms. So the idea would be that a prebiotic basically would be like your your your broccoli um that allows your specific um for to grow in the system.
