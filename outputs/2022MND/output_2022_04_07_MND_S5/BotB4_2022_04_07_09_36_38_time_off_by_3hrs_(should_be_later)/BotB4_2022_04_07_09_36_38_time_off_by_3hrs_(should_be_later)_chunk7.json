NIH NIH chose not to fund the production of insulin through genetic engineering the way it's done, you know, because it it was too risky to blah blah blah. So the the investigator that proposed that got completely rejected and that's the way that insulin is produced in, you know, for everyone nowadays. So there are many great ideas that don't go through NIH and I'm not saying don't go to NIH and I'm not saying, you know, don't try, but I I what I'm saying is that if you know it's a good idea, pursue it through other ways or pursue getting preliminary data so you can show that to NIH.

And and and I also want to mention because I'm a reviewer at NIH that one of the challenges at NIH is that right now microbiome is everywhere. So what they do is you send a proposal that has some microbiome component, they send it to a panel that is investigating, I'm going to put aging as an example, okay? So aging and the microbiome. So they send it to an aging panel where no one there knows about the microbiome, but they call someone like Rosie to be the microbiome expert. And no matter how much Rosie likes that proposal, there's other reviewers that don't maybe don't appreciate the value of the microbiome. So unless Rosie is super outspoken and super defense that proposal and super able to articulate the importance of the microbiome there, the proposal will not get funded.",
