Um as we've looked at stroke models more closely, it's not just inflammation in the parenchyma but uh it seems like a large portion of those immune cells are coming from from the meninges and uh it's one of these areas where there's fenestrated uh on the Venus side so it's one of these areas that are very open uh to potentially uh their metabolites or to uh endotoxins things like that coming from uh from the gut.",

For instance, if you get inflammation and upregulation of IGA in the gut, it also corresponds with increased IGA production uh in the dural layer. Um so it's kind of this coevolutionary idea that it's it's in the benefit of the organism to if something gets across the epithelial barrier to also be able to recognize that at the brain um and respond in a very rapid way, whether that be uh plasma cells which are migrate sensitized in the gut and then migrating to these these areas in the meninges that then have pretty free access to get across to the brain. So kind of an interesting idea.",

So you can have antigens from gut entering circulation and then sensitizing these cells in the meninges or you can have like in the case of stroke or brain damage, you can have antigens coming from the parenchyma as well across the meninges and setting off the immune cascade there.",

Um so from the standpoint of developing models that would help the field, um where do you think are like do we have some good ideas around what factors could be triggering the leaky bear like the leaking barriers and we're just trying to drill down on the mechanisms of how that happens or are we in the phase where we're like we should be screening for a larger set of molecules or metabolites or factors that could be coming from the microbiome. I'm trying to think if we need some sort of scalable model in order to search for more of those or models that would help us like, you know, interrogate specific things mechanistically on a more complex level. Uh maybe the answer is both, so I'd love to hear from all of you about that.",
