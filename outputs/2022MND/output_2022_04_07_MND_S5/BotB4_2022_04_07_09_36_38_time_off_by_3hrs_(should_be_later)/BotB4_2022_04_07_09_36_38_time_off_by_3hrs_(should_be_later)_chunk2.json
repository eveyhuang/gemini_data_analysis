So we are applying a lot of knowledge like that, but uh, I'm not sure what is the best literature. I I did a lot of research on that but couldn't really find the best one that will address the question about how big molecules can go depending on your genetic defect.",

I mean, in a sense, if you have inflammatory mediators that are within the bloodstream, they could impact the endothelium and create leakiness that would be independent of the size of the molecule because once you've broken down the barrier then large molecules can pass too.",

So sometimes the trigger is not known. So you have to actually really come up with a system where you predict triggers because if you do it genetically in different mouse models that can be huge in their price, right? You it's not a lab, it's kind of a company that has to do it. But if you can predict, then you can then go by size because some of those things will be not specific but others will be. So I don't know, that's my thinking there but uh.",

I'm not sure if any screens in this uh realm has been done before or the models good enough for these types of studies.",

So it's very hard to model both in an in vitro system. That's why we went for the in vivo system. So we want to see if a defect in one or two is happening and so on. So that's how we couldn't that's why if there is a system to do that in vitro that will be fantastic.",

Uh so the blood brain barrier where you can uh the focused ultrasound will cause a temporal gap in the blood brain barrier that allows passage over the span of say 30 seconds and then you can close it again. And so so that would allow you to at least isolate that barrier separate from the intestinal barrier. Um, just a thought.",

They show that with images of the tissue.",

And if you provide certain fatty acids for example, you can improve a disrupted barrier. So metabolites can play a role. Um, with respect to the correlation versus associations, the best one that I know of is IBD where you can measure permeability defects in patients before they become IBD patients if you do a screen. So it suggests that permeability is one of the initiating factors.",
