But um one thing I'd like to add um regarding neurochemicals that that Ashley mentioned is um kind of the work we're doing is some kind of genome mining analysis where you could look at the genes of the bacteria of of any bacteria and see if they have something called biosynthetic gene clusters which are uh which produce natural products. Um natural products are secondary metabolites. They're not like the amino acids or lipids or uh sugars that we're used to or short chain fatty acids that we're used to but they're more like these complicated drug looking like uh chemical structures. Um kind of what I'm interested in the reason why we went this route is we're seeing all these bugs in the literature that is associated with diseases but I tell my postdocs all the time I don't care about the bug. I care about what they make uh about how they're communicating is it the small molecules is it the peptides that they're making. Let's get into that. Um so that's my long answer to no my models will not help here Ali but um using some kind of uh omics analysis whether it's looking at the genome whether it's looking at some kind of uh metabolic space like the metabolome or as you mentioned some kind of gene expression would at least point towards what are the biochemical processes that the gut microbes are doing that may be spit out into the chemical milieu and then go up through circulation into the brain causing some kind of uh degenerative auto um degenerate effect caused by inflammation.

So I think that's really overlooked uh and like you say once there's inflammation there um that's kind of the last the last barrier before that signal is going to be disseminated uh throughout the body.

Uh but the higher dose it can. Uh but that is a very crude way of looking at the relationship. The other one in human that we are doing but I don't have that uh tool that Jay you have we are you you know about the extracellular vesicles. Yeah. Uh we now you know with the surface markers you can identify whether they come from the gut or intestinal epithelium or from the brain. You don't know whether they come from the brain whether they come from the microal or the neurons. Um and we showed in patient with Parkinson disease they have increased uh EV in their blood including uh gut derived EV. And and and we are not working with a group in uh Caltech to look at the uh cargo of the EV uh to for the proteomics. And apparently in proteomics world the annotation for bacteria drive peptides is woefully inadequate and we are not getting anything there but my hope is that if we show that you're going to have lots of uh the proinflammatory uh molecules that come from the gut and is associated with severely disease you may get some association using some of the modeling that you guys are doing but still not quite right. But so far in my opinion there are enough noises that gut inflammation has something to do with it but the direct evidence is missing. Now do you think that gut inflammation is promoting neuro inflammation is it because gut inflammation associated with this dysbiosis is all bacteria or is independent of bacteria? And how are we going to tease that one out? Because when you get gut inflammation you're going to get dysbiosis. ",

And I mean, this may be my very simplistic view of the body, but it it seems like everything's in a constant feedback loop. So maybe it's not always inflammation came first and then this. It's not always a causal and effect. And I think there's a lot of different outside factors that could probably contribute to that. Things environmental stress.
