Like you know, you have bacteria, you mix bacteria, you you know, and you simplify. That gets a little more complicated because not all bacteria live nicely in culture systems. Um, you could also do it with supernates and then try to fractionate the supernates from gut. Um, but again, um, this seems like an iterative screening process where you have a model system and you iteratively just screen.",

And then from there try to pin it down in terms of like what the factors are and what the mechanisms are and how they affect the epithelial cells or other tissue components. You could like imagine multiple layers of in vitro models. You can have a very simple model with just epithelium or like more complex models of gut organoids and then you can have the nerves being there or the immune cells being there and like validation layers and then eventually translate all this to mice.",

The and you know, like uh, fungi that we study, some of them are actually present in the mucus. That's how we figure out actually that they're important for the barrier function. Uh, so so uh, we still try to figure out if they utilize the mucus as uh, as a source or they're there for other reasons. But for the mucinolytic bacteria it's figured out and the enzymes are isolated. So that's uh, that that's some cool science that has been done there. I I really liked, you know, the studies from uh, uh, Gunner's lab. I heard he's going to be uh, probably, you know, in five years retiring or something, but uh, they they were like really eye opening uh, when I saw them.",

I almost think that something like this if you could if you could um have that kind of a technological probe that samples mucosal if you will or kind of adherent bacteria, um that then you could do sequencing on and kind of target your in vitro screening models to the bugs that you now know are stuck to the mucosa, maybe that would be a way to narrow things down a little bit from the entire gut microbiome. I'm not a chemist or an engineer in any way, but that was something that was brought up a bunch last year.",

So they're clean uh relatively clean and then you go with a scope and you can actually go against the wall and wash from there and take that part. and that's where we did the sequencing and that's how we found what's associated with the mucosa. But uh in humans it's very hard otherwise. If you go with a probe, it's not going to go in the mucosa and sample clean because it will go goes after that in the fecal material.

So if you have a particular, for example, an O glycan that would be a substrate for a mucinophilic bacteria. Um, it's possible that you could synthesize and one of those moieties with a click um substrate on it. So the azide group which enables click chemistry or start ligation which would you could then click on a fluorescent probe uh too, right? So um you could you know, those bacteria that are utilizing these things might break it down and then incorporate that into their um you know, proteoglycan and then you would have clickable bacteria that would these would be the bacteria that are able to eat um moieties that are found in the mucus. So that might you could possibly use that as a proxy for um those guys uh and and identifying probably with you know, a little broader identification of those things that are that are able to perform these mucolytic events, but that not might not be exactly what we're looking for here. But there are chemical probes like that where you can you feed a sugar that has an azide group and then it it's displayed on the bacterium. And probably the host too.",
