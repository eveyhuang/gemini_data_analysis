If there has been studies any like in in mice or in human patients with germ free versus, you know, antibiotic I don't I don't really know if anything has been done in that space, but I know that there's a lot of cross talk between tissue components there and all of those tissue components could be targeted by microbial factors directly or indirectly. there's a lot to unpack there for sure.

And and and I also want to mention because I'm a reviewer at NIH that one of the challenges at NIH is that right now microbiome is everywhere. So what they do is you send a proposal that has some microbiome component, they send it to a panel that is investigating, I'm going to put aging as an example, okay? So aging and the microbiome. So they send it to an aging panel where no one there knows about the microbiome, but they call someone like Rosie to be the microbiome expert. And no matter how much Rosie likes that proposal, there's other reviewers that don't maybe don't appreciate the value of the microbiome. So unless Rosie is super outspoken and super defense that proposal and super is able to articulate the importance of the microbiome there, the proposal will not get funded. ",
