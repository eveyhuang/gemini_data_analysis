Is it some type of um, you know, structural abnormality or change, right? So I think there's just a diversity there in terms of types of measurements and and how do we integrate them? Um, and I think comes back to the fact that we need technology.",

            "transcript": "I'd like to add to what Stephanie's saying. Um, I think often times at least I know from a very narrow point of view in analytical chemistry, like we all get in our silos of like what we're really good at measuring. Like yeah, I use electrochemistry and I I can measure only a subset of electroactive neurotransmitters really well, but I miss everything else that's going on. Whereas mass spectrometry can pick up a lot of other uh molecules that I can't measure as an electrochemist. And I think one of the things that to push technology forward is we need to start not necessarily combining these technologies because that might be impossible, but like combining these data sets we have to get a holistic picture of what's going on and actually working more together on the technology front to like potentially develop new technologies that can combine the power of mass spec and electrochemistry and imaging and all of these things together. Um, instead of just focus I I mean I am guilty of it as well is just looking at, you know, norepinephrin and dopamine and serotonin because that's what we can measure.",

And it is happening and it is possible when we are mapping global biochemical changes in Alzheimer's disease, we are using 10 platforms. 10 platforms together to generate data sets that we can connect at the end exactly what you described and our journey started with electrochemistry where we went in and we measured specifically tryptophan tyrosine related metabolites reliably, quantitatively, exquisite platform for for neurotransmitters. We enhanced and we connected and we added to this by measuring the rest of metabolism that affects tryptophan metabolism and tyrosine metabolism. And exactly what you said, eight platforms together gives you a big power and it is happening and it is part of what NIA is funding for Alzheimer's disease.",

            "transcript": "Maybe I can add that one one aspect that I I think is missing is is uh under understanding kind of the baseline variation and then also the longitudinal variation in in this. Oftentimes we're taking single time point measurements and that's you know, conflated by lots of different things, right? Um, you know, like diet has such a big influence on the microbiome but also on the metabolites that, you know, are are are present and so some of those things are very difficult to control and so understanding those variations starting out could be really interesting. And I think one one possible uh way to think about this is is um instead of just purely measuring the metabolites themselves, you could potentially measure the responses to the metabolites by the host in some longitudinal fashion. Uh and that might give you a additional um kind of anchor for for thinking about this. Uh so you know, some of the emerging technologies in in in, you know, these like in vivo cellular recording systems, you know, they're still at very early stages uh could be, you know, one one form of this where if you can somehow integrate the transcriptome um into a set of packets that either goes into the genome that then you can sequence or, you know, secreted into a cell free format then you can then do kind of cell free measurements um in a in a more uh you know, uh longitudinal fashion. those those could be really useful as well. So I'm always a big fan of transferring difficult to measure uh things into things that you can sequence because that's to me the the most mature of any of the analytical measurement techniques. So if there's some ways where you can um convert any of these signals that way that could be really interesting.",

So getting to the questions of what does real time mean, um, I think we're going to have to look at many different time resolution scales depending on the particular um molecules that we care about and not just the molecules but their actual influences on physiology.",

What are the list of metabolites I can focus on today that I know are produced or influenced by the gut microbiome, how can I measure them and how can I get a read on the brain? Do I use an FMRS? what is the imaging? we should not forget about the imaging. It's a connector, right? It's a connecting piece, but it's limited in terms of providing information on metabolism of the brain, right? connecting you know, the wealth of what we are measuring in blood with what we are measuring in the brain. It is it is something. Do I want to label glycolysis? Do I want to label the short chain fatty acids the do I need to label the indoles that are produced by the gut bacteria at the end, right? it's an important question and do I have the tools? If I want to study or metabolism in the brain, yes, how can I study it, right? And the way we ended up doing this is using transcriptomics and metabolomics and imaging to try to get at the problem from different angles and say what can I learn about this specific pathway that I know is in part regulated by the gut microbiome.",
