Um, you know, like diet has such a big influence on the microbiome but also on the metabolites that, you know, are are are present and so some of those things are very difficult to control and so understanding those variations starting out could be really interesting. And I think one one possible uh way to think about this is is um instead of just purely measuring the metabolites themselves, you could potentially measure the responses to the metabolites by the host in some longitudinal fashion. Uh and that might give you a additional um kind of anchor for for thinking about this. Uh so you know, some of the emerging technologies in in in, you know, these like in vivo cellular recording systems, you know, they're still at very early stages uh could be, you know, one one form of this where if you can somehow integrate the transcriptome um into a set of packets that either goes into the genome that then you can sequence or, you know, secreted into a cell free format then you can then do kind of cell free measurements um in a in a more uh you know, uh longitudinal fashion. those those could be really useful as well. So I'm always a big fan of transferring difficult to measure uh things into things that you can sequence because that's to me the the most mature of any of the analytical measurement techniques.
