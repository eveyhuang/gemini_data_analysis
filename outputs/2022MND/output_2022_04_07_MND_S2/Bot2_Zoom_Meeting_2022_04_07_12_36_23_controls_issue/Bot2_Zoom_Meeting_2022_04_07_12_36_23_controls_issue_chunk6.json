There's like low concentration, you're fighting like, you know, cell death versus, you know, active metabolism and like so we do it but I mean I and I I guess I don't have enough experience to say that I would go to blood over CSF because I tend to measure more in CSF but",

I don't know and then I think there's like I was I was trying to think about like other ways for probe development and then it just becomes either you have to make a probe for every single molecule you're ever interested in or you have something that's like a general probe that tells you something, you know, it's it's not molecule specific necessarily. I I don't know, maybe maybe none of that made sense but",

What what I do want to say though is that if we want to understand the effect on the brain like we we have to know just because the the molecules are present in the body doesn't mean they're present in the brain as well. Right? So we can describe the body's state and that's appropriate but they may not be having any those molecules may not be having any effect on the brain. If we want to know what that effect is, I think we have to get to the brain. Yeah. the the the molecules that are in the brain. Now, I I think it's clear that all these diseases are uh are systemic, you know, the whole I mean ASD is classic, right? You know, the I guess even the whole gut brain talk is is telling us that even these neurological diseases we've thought of very simplistically as just Alzheimer's affecting amyloid plaques there but you know, there there's systemic things that happen as well.",
