Whereas mass spectrometry can pick up a lot of other uh molecules that I can't measure as an electrochemist. And I think one of the things that to push technology forward is we need to start not necessarily combining these technologies because that might be impossible, but like combining these data sets we have to get a holistic picture of what's going on and actually working more together on the technology front to like potentially develop new technologies that can combine the power of mass spec and electrochemistry and imaging and all of these things together.

Oftentimes we're taking single time point measurements and that's you know, conflated by lots of different things, right? Um, you know, like diet has such a big influence on the microbiome but also on the metabolites that, you know, are are are present and so some of those things are very difficult to control and so understanding those variations starting out could be really interesting. And I think one one possible uh way to think about this is is um instead of just purely measuring the metabolites themselves, you could potentially measure the responses to the metabolites by the host in some longitudinal fashion. Uh and that might give you a additional um kind of anchor for for thinking about this. Uh so you know, some of the emerging technologies in in in, you know, these like in vivo cellular recording systems, you know, they're still at very early stages uh could be, you know, one one form of this where if you can somehow integrate the transcriptome um into a set of packets that either goes into the genome that then you can sequence or, you know, secreted into a cell free format then you can then do kind of cell free measurements um in a in a more uh you know, uh longitudinal fashion. those those could be really useful as well. So I'm always a big fan of transferring difficult to measure uh things into things that you can sequence because that's to me the the most mature of any of the analytical measurement techniques. So if there's some ways where you can um convert any of these signals that way that could be really interesting.",

What are the list of metabolites I can focus on today that I know are produced or influenced by the gut microbiome, how can I measure them and how can I get a read on the brain? Do I use an FMRS? what is the imaging? we should not forget about the imaging. It's a connector, right? It's a connecting piece, but it's limited in terms of providing information on metabolism of the brain, right? connecting you know, the wealth of what we are measuring in blood with what we are measuring in the brain. It is it is something. Do I want to label glycolysis? Do I want to label the short chain fatty acids the do I need to label the indoles that are produced by the gut bacteria at the end, right? it's an important question and do I have the tools? If I want to study or metabolism in the brain, yes, how can I study it, right? And the way we ended up doing this is using transcriptomics and metabolomics and imaging to try to get at the problem from different angles and say what can I learn about this specific pathway that I know is in part regulated by the gut microbiome.",

So so at least we have an ability to monitor in blood, we can monitor things that can affect these brain regions and we know these brain regions affected are implicated in disease. At least in depression, anxiety, we mapped exactly these sulfur containing compounds, they are changing and they correlate with imaging changes in areas that are relevant to disease.

For like a screening, then do you really need a sensor? Like to get like a real time measurement or you know, or do you just use blood or CSF or some other source. Um you know, if it's obviously something that can only be measured if you swallow a little micro sensor, then obviously that would be valuable, but then again also, yeah, what you're going to use with the data.

I think that could also and to that could also improve improve clinical kind of scoring of of a lot of these things because a lot of the clinical ways that you know, you do autism spectrum or other things are are quite observational, but if you had more data that could nuance the the molecular differences between the patient cohorts, that could better stratify across many different ways in terms of the therapies that you would try to address those.
