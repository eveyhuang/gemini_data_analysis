We know now that the blood metabolome informs significantly about changes in the brain through FMRS, FMRI, brain you know a whole area of imaging, it informs, it's it correlates strongly, it does tell you something. So so at least we have an ability to monitor in blood, we can monitor things that can affect these brain regions and we know these brain regions affected are implicated in disease. At least in depression, anxiety, we mapped exactly these sulfur containing compounds, they are changing and they correlate with imaging changes in areas that are relevant to disease. So at least we can do something, a starting point in the brain, do we need to to have sensors for the brain over time, are they needed for research or for diagnosis? I think research more so for now.",

You know, like sometimes I ask my group just because you can, should you? Um because like if you're going to use a measurement once a year, right? For like a screening, then do you really need a sensor? Like to get like a real time measurement or you know, or do you just use blood or CSF or some other source. Um you know, if it's obviously something that can only be measured if you swallow a little micro sensor, then obviously that would be valuable, but then again also, yeah, what you're going to use with the data. Otherwise, we could find ourselves just being kind of purist in terms of the scientists and get more data, more data, more data and we don't we aren't using the data.

And then find, you know, the the best, the cheapest, the most scalable technologies to measure them. Exactly. I think that could also and to that could also improve improve clinical kind of scoring of of a lot of these things because a lot of the clinical ways that you know, you do autism spectrum or other things are are quite observational, but if you had more data that could nuance the the molecular differences between the patient cohorts, that could better stratify across many different ways in terms of the therapies that you would try to address those. Um especially for these like better heterogeneous presented um diseases. It's it's really difficult. So so I do think that yeah, being able to stratify on that front would be very useful.",

So, you know, so I think that's perhaps something maybe um a database has to be built, right? To to eventually reach to what Harris was talking about having this like baseline survey.",
