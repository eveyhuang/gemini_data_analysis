What what what we refer to as the metabolome is the collection of small molecules that are present. If you go and you measure in your blood in an annual test checkup, you measure glucose, cholesterol, and what we have done as a metabolomics community over the past two decades is to scale up the knowledge about the measure of these chemicals in the blood, in tissue, in the brain, in in any organ that you can imagine and say, have we really missed on some of our biochemistry? Have we missed information available in these small molecules that do convey significant information about our health and therefore as a community over two decades of metabolomics, lipidomics researchers, we have expanded the horizon so that we can measure 2,000, 3,000 chemicals in the blood that we can identify, that we can name.",

You look at pathways such as cholesterol or pathways such as indoles, tryptophan leading to indole production and you say my goodness, half of the pathway is catalyzed by human genes, the other half of the pathway is catalyzed by bacterial enzymes. Yes? You know, I give you an example, tryptophan, tryptophan can be metabolized to serotonin, to canurine, to right 5HIA or it can go to the gut and get metabolized by bacteria in the gut to produce indoles. Some of these indoles, right? Depending on what bacteria you have in your gut, you can produce indoxyl sulfate. We heard from the beautiful presentation of Rosie, some of the sulfated compounds, their their effect in autism, we see them now in depression, we see them in anxiety, we see them linked to cognition. So the bacteria is completing our metabolism.",
