That's that's based on the oxygenation of within the blood. In this case, you know, if we if we actually think the blood is a pretty good representative tissue, you know, to represent the uh the the fingerprint, you know, of metabolite. What are the other property that we can take advantage? You know, what what what is a metabolite? For example, you know, Ashley is taking the redox potential as one of the advantage, you know, to to get the the feature of the metabolite. Any other things that we can think of from the pure chemical chemistry and and and uh even photophysics point of view. For example, if we disturb, if we disturb, we can optogenetics can definitely disturb very quick quickly, you know, the brain, local brain function. Maybe this after this disturbance, you know, the response, how fast the response is happening, that that's like to to describe the zero order and the first derivative, right? This first derivative will be how fast and how strength strong the response is. So that potentially can also become a uh a fingerprint. But at that at that point, we need to actually see what will be the the zero order information that we pay attention to. Other than the redox potential or oxygenation, anything else?",

You put someone on a treadmill and you profile them as they are on a treadmill, you can uncover a whole area of things about their unique metabolism. So perturbing a system with diet or exercise is a is a wonderful thing. Whether this is going to apply to the brain, right? Does it can it give us a readout on metabolism in the brain and the abberances of metabolism in the brain. Fascinating.",

So, you know, we we actually can um develop this sensing probes to be like nanometer scale, so we can prove uh synaptic neurotransmission. We can also make them to be uh larger in size, so where we uh implant those into the um uh the brain of the rodent, so we can monitor the activity of the uh behaving rodent.

The good news is they are usable after 10 years of freezing blood samples minus 80, we see that the metabolome is quite intact. So that that's a good thing. Number two, the electrochemistry is exquisite, really in mapping quantitatively at low concentrations, trip, tyrosine and related purine pathways. The rest of the metabolism also gives you quite a bit of the rest of the of the the canurine. Yes, think about the the the rest of metabolism of GABA, the interconnectedness between GABA, glutamate and the TCA and the urea cycle. there's a lot more that you are you can learn by measuring on a mass spec, the rest of the metabolism related to neurotransmission, the biosynthesis of these neurotransmitters, the metabolism of these neurotransmitters.
