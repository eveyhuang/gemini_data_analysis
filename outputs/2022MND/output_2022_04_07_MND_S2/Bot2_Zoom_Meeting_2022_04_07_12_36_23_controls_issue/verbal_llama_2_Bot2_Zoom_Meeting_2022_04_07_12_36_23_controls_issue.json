Uh and that might give you a additional um kind of anchor for for thinking about this. Uh so you know, some of the emerging technologies in in in, you know, these like in vivo cellular recording systems, you know, they're still at very early stages uh could be, you know, one one form of this where if you can somehow integrate the transcriptome um into a set of packets that either goes into the genome that then you can sequence or, you know, secreted into a cell free format then you can then do kind of cell free measurements um in a in a more uh you know, uh longitudinal fashion. those those could be really useful as well.
