No, I'm I'm just you want to you want to keep carbon oxide on the surface, right? Because you want it to you want to make hydrocarbons, right? So you want CO on the surface. But the problem is you have an isotherm. You go hot and push the CO away. And then you you start having more sites for for hydrogen generation. And so then you need to up your pressure. And so I was doing CO2 reduction at 1500 PSI actually CO reduction. Which then completely changes your mechanistic regime. So this kind of burst is terrible. Like it it drove me almost mad. So just that's all I'm saying. It's like I've been a little bit around challenges in that makes things go very, very crazy, very, very quickly. So we know there's a reaction around room temperature, ambient pressure. But as you start moving away from there, I think there's a lot of space to explore. I hope this answers your question.",

You have to heat up and cool down very slowly. Otherwise, they they make cracks. Then you are done. So, we we actually at one point of time we think about doing these kind of experiment, but we gave up because one experiment just take way longer than if you do low temperature, you probably can do multiple within a day. For high temperature, you barely can do one experiment a day.",

So if you're trying to interrogate a mechanism of CO2 conversion or capture in a liquid phase, you know, there's a certain amount of tools that you use, like you can do online liquid IR, you can do NMR, whereas once you go into the gas phase, you know, the the the methodology is going to be different, right? So, aside from the the chemistry itself, you know, that the the study of the reactions also kind of has a different tool set, right? So, some of us are probably very familiar with the liquid analysis with some some gas here and there. But once you're actually doing mechanisms in the gas phase at high temperature, I think Will might be uniquely poised to to be able to study those, right?
