Because, for example, JP8 is a fuel or the stuff that we pump out and it's a mixture of products, right? And and it just has the right combustion properties to work in uh for us to use it. And so I I've always wonder when people say, you know, making one carbon-based product. I mean, it feel like it's they're all liquid and they all have various fuel properties and as long as that mixture is consistent, can we use it as is? Um, and I I don't I'm not an engineer, so I can't answer or or Oh, really? where I'm not an engine person. So I can't answer that question, but I just know the things that we use right now as fuels are not pure. Right. Um, I don't know if anyone knows more about that than I do.",

Um, the challenge is the practical challenge is that when you're trying to sell a product, um, your byproduct become an issue, a reliability to your company. For example, if you operate a company, so, um, you have to find is usually you will do is to find someone willing to take it. And often time you are running to some troubles, so you have to sell at lower than the market price. That become a big issue when you're trying to operate a business. You know, for for scientific speaking, of course, we are we are scientists, we very into how to play with the selectivity, how to improve the production rate. Um, but for business is totally different thing. Um, and also, you know, if you look at the current chemical industry, how people really doing this kind of process design, usually they produce multiple product and they do the separation process and they sell the separately or they integrated into downstream process trying to make a high value chemicals. Um, this is what why usually if you look at a chemical plant, it's giant. They have so many processes going on at the same time. I did, but and actually they're so to the condition. I think that it was yesterday because there are some update and I think that may have been what messed up. So if we're starting right now, I think there is a mismatch because the current narrative for CO2 reduction is we want to make a product that is high enough in value so that doing this transformation, which does faraday losses, makes sense. So then everyone runs for ethylene and probably a few other products where there is an economic case. But then if we think a little bit forward, that like I'm hoping that if we actually want to make fuel product, then that is a whole different story, right? Because I think Jenny has a point. If we have like ethanol, um propanol, once the computer turns on, I can call you back. once the computer turns on, I can call you back. Um, but then it will not matter so much anymore. Right.
