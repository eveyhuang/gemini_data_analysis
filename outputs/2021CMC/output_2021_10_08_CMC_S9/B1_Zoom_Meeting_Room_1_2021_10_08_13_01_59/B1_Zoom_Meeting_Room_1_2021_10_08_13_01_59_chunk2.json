I said liquid twice, but if you turn off metabolism, that changes completely and these properties, these viscoelastic properties, viscosity, diffusivity and stuff like that, they actually change and it becomes a solid-like glass forming liquid. And that has been the paper in Cell in 2013. And now I saw just one, this is an idea that came into my head like yesterday, so it's very very fresh. But I've been reading already a little bit and last year was a cell paper where they looked at yeast and basically looked at what yeast does if it dries down, if it slows down its metabolic activity and actually compensates by making molecules that keep the viscoelastic properties of the of the cytoplasm kind of the same. So if a cell is basically running through energy or not has an impact on the properties of all the liquids inside. And some cells are trying to compensate for that, which is kind of interesting.",

But they're we're getting hot and so to keep our diffusion and therefore our interactions and reactions going as normal, we have to synthesize more trehalose to slow down diffusion to keep it non-responding to temperature. And so maybe it all comes down to various heat sensors. Maybe heat is the for some, I don't know, I'm rambling.",

            "transcript": "So the reason I got to thinking about this initially was that there's these connections between kind of aging and metabolism and growth rate and metabolism. And so if you grow faster you generally switch towards glycolysis, if you grow slower you generally move towards respiration. And it makes sense like you want to grow fast and so but is there a trade-off? And so kind of getting back to how you're how would you measure this or how does this affect the cell, is it noisier in the cell? And again how you measure noise is a it could be at the protein-protein interaction level, it could be at a gene expression level, but is everything a little noisier and so if we think about bacteria, they're just less robust, right? They don't live a super long time because they grow very fast and where humans grow very slowly and they live a long time. And so can could this be somewhat tied to these differences in entropy or enthalpy generation from these different metabolisms? And I agree that how do you measure this and whether a cell senses it or if it's just a byproduct of how cells work. I don't know if they need a sensor but the cells would work differently but can you measure that difference I guess? And that's always the thing I've struggled with experimentally of how would you measure this because it's such subtle things over very very long periods that I think it's going to be a very minor effect but accumulating over time.",

So okay so I'll just briefly jump in here. There's something called the Warburg effect. So cancers uh often are are are primarily doing glycolysis. And one thing though that maybe relevant to what you're saying that is worth keeping in mind, part of the reason glycolysis is important because you're making backbones for biosynthesis. So that's one of the reasons that you've got the glycolysis running so much for cells that are growing really fast is that all of those backbones are not waste, they just get they get peeled off and used to make stuff.",

So this brown adipose that's churning through tons of energy to basically heat things up, it has to somehow maintain its identity as a cell, it still works as a cell even though it's got this totally kind of different metabolic program running inside it because it needs to literally generate tons of waste. I mean that's kind of like the point. So that's it's a generally I think interesting question of how these systems manage to sort of optimize themselves along multiple directions and this would be a really good way to look and see how thermodynamics actually is one of the constraints it has to satisfy.
