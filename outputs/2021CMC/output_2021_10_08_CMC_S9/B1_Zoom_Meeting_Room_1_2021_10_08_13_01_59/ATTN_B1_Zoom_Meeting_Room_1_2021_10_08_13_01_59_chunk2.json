      "transcript": "processes going on in there. The properties of the cytoplasm are that of a fragile liquid-like glass-forming liquid. I said liquid twice, but if you turn off metabolism, that changes completely and these properties, these viscoelastic properties, viscosity, diffusivity and stuff like that, they actually change and it becomes a solid-like glass-forming liquid. And that has been the paper in Cell in 2013. And now I saw just one, this is an idea that came into my head like yesterday, so it's very very fresh. But I've been reading already a little bit and last year was a Cell paper where they looked at yeast and basically looked at what yeast does if it drives down, if it slows down its metabolic activity and actually compensates by making molecules that keep the viscoelastic properties of the cytoplasm kind of the same. So if a cell is basically running through energy or not has an impact on the properties of all the liquids inside. And some cells are trying to compensate for that, which is kind of interesting.",
