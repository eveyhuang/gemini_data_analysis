Uh but clearly pretty much uh you know a huge fraction of of anything we're looking at biologically is going to be uh quite far from equilibrium. Um and so uh what I wanted you to think about are examples of practical questions well I guess there's two possibilities one is an example of a case that you're familiar with or could imagine where that type of approach is going to you know get you into trouble if you're trying to make predictions for example. Um another side of that could be an example of a practical question in non-equilibrium thermodynamics because if you go try to read papers on non-equilibrium thermo they're pretty heavy right. I I am I'm a biologist in a chemistry department um and a lot of these papers are really much more than I could possibly deal with but there are um clear examples of of things that as a biologist I would like to be able to predict but but can't without the you know a developed non-equilibrium thermodynamics. So either focus on something where using equilibrium thermo gets you into trouble or focus on a question um of a kind of practical relevance in non-equilibrium thermo.

And so kind of getting back to how you're how would you measure this or how does this affect the cell, is it noisier in the cell? And again how you measure noise is a it could be at the protein-protein interaction level, it could be at a gene expression level, but is everything a little noisier and so if we think about bacteria, they're just less robust, right? They don't live a super long time because they grow very fast and where humans grow very slowly and they live a long time. And so can could this be somewhat tied to these differences in entropy or enthalpy generation from these different metabolisms? And I agree that how do you measure this and whether a cell senses it or if it's just a byproduct of how cells work. I don't know if they need a sensor but the cells would work differently but can you measure that difference I guess? And that's always the thing I've struggled with experimentally of how would you measure this because it's such subtle things over very very long periods that I think it's going to be a very minor effect but accumulating over time.

It was simply that part of the difficulty just because like why we why it's so hard to pinpoint equilibrium properties equilibrium properties in biology is that maybe it's not the only thing that's dictating our outcomes that we're reading out. Like so I'm thinking of how a transporter works for example. Of course chemical equilibrium electrostatic equilibrium is one thing that drives it or even a channel forget a transporter but there's a lot of other very local electrostatic properties and and shape like just like pore filling and stuff that also contribute and that makes it that much harder to say okay we know all the players. So those are I was just trying to think of cases where just a strict definition of equilibrium will not suffice. ",
