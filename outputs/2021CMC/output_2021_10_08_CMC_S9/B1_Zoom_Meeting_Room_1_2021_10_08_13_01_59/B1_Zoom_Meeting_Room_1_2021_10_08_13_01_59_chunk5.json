They have been validated on simple biological systems like unzipping an RNA or something Jan Liphardt's classic paper from way back when. But with those kinds of systems because they're simple you can basically track most of the degrees of freedom that we have you know that you need to. With a lot of these cellular things that's very hard maybe not possible anytime soon. And so one question I've always asked myself is you know how bad can we do but still get away with using some of these ideas. That's you know that and and actually Holly your point about you know we abuse a lot of equilibrium thinking and apply it to steady state systems but it does actually work a lot right? And so that's a case where we can get away with some sloppy application and I wonder how much we how we would even start to understand like what kind of errors we can tolerate in our measurements but still make you know to see how much these non-equilibrium statistical mechanical ideas apply to biology.

What if we applied that same sort of first principles thinking but kind of come up with new laws and new rules for how biological active matter works because it seems to me like they're kind of operating by somewhat overlapping but quite different ways.

I was wondering if it's a matter of time scales and in the sense of you know sure it's out of equilibrium but maybe at some time scales at which we're looking at the system it doesn't really matter because it's not such a huge either because it's not so far from equilibrium or maybe because it's been far long enough that then you have a new kind of more microscopic equilibrium going on.

It was simply that part of the difficulty just because like why we why it's so hard to pinpoint equilibrium properties equilibrium properties in biology is that maybe it's not the only thing that's dictating our outcomes that we're reading out. Like so I'm thinking of how a transporter works for example. Of course chemical equilibrium electrostatic equilibrium is one thing that drives it or even a channel forget a transporter but there's a lot of other very local electrostatic properties and and shape like just like pore filling and stuff that also contribute and that makes it that much harder to say okay we know all the players. So those are I was just trying to think of cases where just a strict definition of equilibrium will not suffice.",
