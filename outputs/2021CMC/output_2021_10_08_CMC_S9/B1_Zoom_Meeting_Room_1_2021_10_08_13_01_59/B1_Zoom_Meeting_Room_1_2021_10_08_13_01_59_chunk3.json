I'm actually an engineer in chemical engineering department, so I studied thermodynamics and kinetics a lot when I was a student. But for me it's kind of interesting to compare different cells at different levels. For example, if you compare a bacterial cell against a mammalian cell, mammalian cell is way bigger, right? So it's larger, but in the meantime it has a lot of proteins, a lot more proteins and a lot more metabolites compared with other species. So if we think about these two species, these two different cells, bacterial versus mammalian cell, the salt concentration, not just salt, the chemical species concentration inside the cell is very high in both cases. And as a result, they they are very sensitive to the changing environment. If there is a small change of the environment, they can change the intracellular concentration of this species accordingly. And then the entropy, in this case we call it the entropy of mixing in chemistry, will change dramatically. As a result, I think in my opinion, a mammalian cell is more sensitive to this salt concentration change or the metabolite or protein concentration change.",

Mammalian cell genome encodes way more proteins, for example. And I think there are more chemical species inside the cellular environment. As such, there are more, you know, perturbation possibilities. A chemical or a protein concentration change can easily happen inside the mammalian cell compared with the bacterial cell. As such, the entropy can be very sensitive. The change of entropy can be very dramatic in this in in mammalian cell compared with the bacterial cell. So ideally, if the entropy change is so dramatic, thermodynamically it's not so stable, right, compared if you compare these two cells. So I'm just saying, you know, in my opinion it's interesting to see these two cell types have different features in terms of the entropy situation.",

There are a lot of background noise going on. So I don't really know if people can really calculate or understand the entropy change, particularly if we are talking about big molecules impact versus small molecules impact.

And so maybe we should take a moment here to make sure that they have connection to the appropriate web page that they can be entering the notes. We all need to put our names in.
