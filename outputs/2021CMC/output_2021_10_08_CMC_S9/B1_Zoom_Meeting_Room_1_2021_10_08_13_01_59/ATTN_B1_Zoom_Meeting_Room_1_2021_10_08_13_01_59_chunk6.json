      "transcript": "the diffusion of GFP just a single protein at the single molecule level by fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy in different subcellular compartments. And if Einstein Boltzmann were correct which I'm sure it is and increasing temperature increases your diffusion right? But in the case that we talked about with the yeast visco adapting and all of that that's one example of diffusion equilibrium not working out right? The other is so we measured the GFP diffusion in the cytoplasm and in the lumen of the nuclear envelope. And when you increase the heat of the environment the diffusion in the cytoplasm does speed up but the diffusion inside the lumen doesn't change. And so right there there's a violation of the Einstein Boltzmann law which probably is due to the fact that you're dealing with hydrodynamic coupling and all sorts of crazy stuff with you know those two membranes that are giving you a boundary condition.",
