So um actually but just to go back so Gang-Yu do you agree that maybe uh refocusing this around um non-equilibrium thermodynamics and biology and and the study of non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a reasonable focus? Okay. So given that then it might be nice if people could uh take five minutes to to think about the following okay so um in chemistry classes we all learn equilibrium thermodynamics right it's it's what we use to understand and predict chemical reactions. Uh but clearly pretty much uh you know a huge fraction of of anything we're looking at biologically is going to be uh quite far from equilibrium. Um and so uh what I wanted you to think about are examples of practical questions well I guess there's two possibilities one is an example of a case that you're familiar with or could imagine where that type of approach is going to you know get you into trouble if you're trying to make predictions for example. Um another side of that could be an example of a practical question in non-equilibrium thermodynamics because if you go try to read papers on non-equilibrium thermo they're pretty heavy right. I I am I'm a biologist in a chemistry department um and a lot of these papers are really much more than I could possibly deal with but there are um clear examples of of things that as a biologist I would like to be able to predict but but can't without the you know a developed non-equilibrium thermodynamics. So either focus on something where using equilibrium thermo gets you into trouble or focus on a question um of a kind of practical relevance in non-equilibrium thermo. Okay so five minutes and we'll reassemble.",

So the whole point of like life is this non-equilibrium metabolism and thermodynamics and you produce entropy and so this is kind of like you were talking about whenever I talk or try to read a physics paper on entropy I think it's different than what's in my head. But so you have glycolysis and respiration and respiration is closer to equilibrium you get more efficiency it's supposedly slower um you produce less entropy from respiration more entropy from glycolysis because there's a bigger delta G. Does does that affect the system at all? If you have a cell that was producing ATP exclusively through glycolysis exclusively through respiration does the output of that entropy so does the non-equilibrium thermodynamics affect the cell in any way?",

It's something that we're actually trying to do ourselves with these little diamonds. Um but I I the the pause I have with stuff like that is is is heat even a useful way to think about waste and entropy generation in the cell because the cell not only will make heat when it has some entropy generation the cell's full of all kinds of side chemical reactions and those might not show up as heat but they still are waste. And so the degree to which these like sets of reactions are organized away from waste and toward productive use and the degree to which you can capture that using things like heat or temperature I actually now I'm really not sure anymore. Other comments or questions?",
