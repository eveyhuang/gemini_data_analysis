It seems like there's a lot of study about how they move on an isolated cell, but I wonder in a tissue whether cell-cell interaction doesn't play a very significant role. And so that's just my basic question of I presume people have done these measurements but I'm completely ignorant of the field and if someone else has comments about this, I'd be interested.",

And then those are measurements on an isolated cell. Have people done it on tissues and are the results similar? And for example, the rate of EGF conformational changes that when an EGF molecule comes in, you know, it has a certain rate constant for example to get through the membrane. Is that what is it in real life, so to speak? And I I just don't know.",

I'm like a chemical biologist and so we work with immortalized cell lines and even with those when you dilute them too much, like they die. Like there's some magical thing in quorum sensing or whatever you want to call it where the cells need many other cells to be nearby or else they totally change and they get sickly. And so I imagine the same thing has to be true with tissues and there it's not it's going to be so heterogeneous too. And I I like this word like holistic, like the holistic view of a cell and and I always think or like a tissue and when you're like again as a chemical biologist like we want to get molecular information about these systems and the more molecular information you get, the like less holistic information and like your holistic view starts to like break down. And so like how is there a way that we can sort of like balance those two and like retain the sort of holistic information of of tissues or multicellular systems but get molecular information on it?",

      "transcript": "So I can kind of add to what Alexis was talking about and you know, following up. You know, it's it's definitely so we're interested in cancer and we're interested in generating basically chemical tools where we can, you know, track in the cases of macrophages and circadian rhythms, these dynamic processes. And one of the reasons why we use reporters is because we want to be able to incorporate and recapitulate, you know, or incorporate different and multiple cell types and recapitulate these, you know, three-dimensional and even two-dimensional but multicellular environments because, you know, all of this really does matter and it does make a difference what cells are nearby, you know, what are what are the activity states of the cells that are nearby, you know, even in terms of, you know, culture so Alexis mentioned, you know, just the density of cells but also whether you culture the cells in two dimensions versus three dimensions, right? And and the last thing I want to bring up because I I already feel like I've talked for a little bit here, is is also just the the characteristics of the environment, things like stiffness, right? Because one of the things that that came up are, you know, how do we define these tissue units and cellular neighborhoods and are they different in different organs? They're absolutely different in different organs because, you know, some organs are more homogeneous, others are more heterogeneous, and and the physical characteristics of different organs is also different. So, you know, being able to recapitulate all those things is extremely difficult and I'm and I'm interested to hear from, you know, the the physical tool people about how we can get more out of, you know, these systems because at this stage, you know, it's it's hard to do period.",

Which what is playing a role, right? And probably all of them are and there's a collective, right, almost decision making that the cells are doing kind of like incorporating all those signals from the environment, but which one is more important and how each of
