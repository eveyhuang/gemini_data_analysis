      "transcript": "Yeah, yeah, that would be fun, more functional than just isotope. It's an analogy. Yeah, very nice. And also on the topic that you both touched which is communication. Abhijit mentioned diffusion and Alison mentioned using metabolism. Another way of cell communication or cell-cell communication is specific, it's through the membrane nanotube that they can transport things. As a matter of fact, in one of my student's Lilian's experiment, she and Jackie from biomedical engineering found that if you put an older cell and a young cell together to form the membrane nanotube, the older cell can be rejuvenated, which is a great news I think for for this group. Paul and I love to mingle with the young people again. So just a lighthearted comment, but we want to hear more of you about if you can do one thing. Thank you, Gary. Thank you. Yeah, so if you can do one thing in this topic, what would that be? Pipe dream welcome, current technology great. So floor is yours.",

      "transcript": "One thing that I actually wanted to just bring up although this may, I guess I can tie this into you know the one thing that that would be useful technologically is that you know in the context of of sort of molecular transport, one thing that I don't think has been mentioned is just the phenomenon of trogocytosis in immune cells specifically, but just that understanding to what extent that phenomenon extends to other types of cells as well. So you know so in the case of the interaction between lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells, one of the critical phenomena is the formation of something called the immune synapse where you know MHC molecules and T and and and T cell receptors complex and what's been observed is that basically there are you know basically in entire protein complexes can basically transpose from one membrane to the next right based on this particular complex. And you can imagine that of course if you have a network of of of closely interacting cells, that means that potentially you can have sort of a propagation of of translated proteins over a large length scale in a in a controlled way, right? Whereas of course you know once a cell releases a metabolite, it no longer has control over that metabolite. Nevertheless, if you have a network of antigen-presenting and T cells that are that that have formed these specific immune complexes, then you could have sort of a a controlled transport of proteins over very very large length scales even though the cells themselves are much smaller.",

Any given antigen-presenting cell can certainly complex with a very large number of T cells and so even though I'm not entirely sure if sort of like the actual measurement has been traced for any given molecule to to kind of you know trace that network, I'm just kind of arguing from first principles that it that
