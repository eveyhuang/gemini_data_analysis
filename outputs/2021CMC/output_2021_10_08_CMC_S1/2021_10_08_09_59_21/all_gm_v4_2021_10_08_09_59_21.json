It's it's definitely so we're interested in cancer and we're interested in generating basically chemical tools where we can you know track in the cases of macrophages and circadian rhythms these dynamic processes. And one of the reasons why we use reporters is because we want to be able to incorporate and recapitulate or incorporate different and multiple cell types and recapitulate these you know three-dimensional and even two-dimensional but multicellular environments because you know all of this really does matter and it does make a difference what cells are nearby, you know what are what are the activity states of the cells that are nearby, you know even in terms of you know culturing so Alexis mentioned you know just the density of cells but also whether you culture the cells in two dimensions versus three dimensions right? You can have the same exact cell type but you have you know wildly different characteristics in terms of you know what's being expressed, what's being secreted, etc. Is is also just the the characteristics of the environment, things like stiffness, right? Because one of the things that that came up are you know how do we define these tissue units and cellular neighborhoods and are they different in different organs? They're absolutely different in different organs because you know some organs are more homogeneous, others are more heterogeneous and and the physical characteristics of different organs is also different. So you know being able to recapitulate all those things is extremely difficult and I and I'm interested to hear from you know the the physical tool people about how we can get more out of you know these systems because at this stage you know it's it's hard to do period.",

Multiple processes multiple things that are changing all the time at different length scales and different time scales. The the the environment is changing affecting the cell the cell is remodeling back the environment and that environment is changing again right?

Like on the nano scale, so I'm trying to understand this from the perspective of a protein. So like with Paul's example, if EGF is passing through the ECM, if it has to reach that receptor, from the perspective of the protein, a value of like stiffness that Michelle brought up, that's how the cell culturing people think of it. But from the perspective of the protein, is it really sensing a stiffness? It's sensing or it's seeing the surroundings as like heterogeneity in like the chemistry around it, the charges, the different forces it's feeling that way on smaller length scales. And it's also viewing the heterogeneity of like confinement and of these static or somewhat flexible barriers around it as well. So I don't think we've applied tools at the nano scale to the surroundings there. And I think we focused on, okay, when the EGF reaches the receptors, that's when we start using the nano scale tools inside, once it gets to the receptor on the membrane, the signaling cascade within the cell. But before that, it's just kind of assumed that like, oh, those metabolites or those signaling proteins, they make it there. And I don't think that's necessarily like true. It's more complex than we might assume of things just, oh, it just randomly diffuses and it makes it there.",

I received two letters from a cosmetic company who asked me for a graduate student who is well versed in the cell ECM interaction, which is right in the alley of the topic today. And then they want to hire them as a R&D specialist. So I recommended one of my student was rejected immediately. From his record, I could not believe the rejection. At least I would expect an interview. And finally, my departmental wisdom, he works on the more foundation funded uh project. My department senior colleagues who has much higher wisdom told me, ah, what they are seeking is young lady scientist who really understand the skin care as well as science. So with that, we succeeded. So for the cell ECM interaction to rejuvenate the skin is what they want. So, uh on that lighthearted notes, I won't disclose the company's name for fear of any political fallout, but they definitely have their preference on the topic. Uh, but the ECM cell interaction is of great importance. So, uh with that, I want to change the gears a little bit.

        "transcript": "Yeah, so like actually Alison and me we actually have a funded project running through the Moore foundation like through through CMC on something that is related like and so might be yeah but like the question is the question is how to frame the question. I think that's where we are at this point of time thinking. So like in terms of like to do computations to do any sort of theoretical analysis first of all we have to kind of give this problem some sort of a basis and that's what I was primarily thinking. So one basis can be forces. So what we had thought of is can we introduce something like a mechanophore an object that kind of changes its color based on the mechanical properties around it as a probe of the of the force environment heterogeneous or homogeneous whatever that might be. We were primarily thinking intercellular because a lot more work has happened on an extracellular level but still like let's say mechanophore as an object as a reporter for what is the force environment of a cell was something that that we have been thinking about because that gives me a basis something called a force field essentially within which now a bunch of mechanical responses can be computationally achieved. That's from a very you know hardcore physics perspective. Now let's think of learning and that's what I was like looking up might be the colleagues here can can comment on like normally when this is such a multi-scale problem like when you have let's say inputs and outputs let's say inputs at a molecular level as at the level of proteins and outputs that are felt at the level of you know the cell ECM interactions which itself are not very well defined might be models can be built like you know with a very clear focus in mind that here is my molecular level input and there is my intercellular communication level output and and purely as a and purely as a I would say like people have done in genotype phenotype modeling where genes are being tinkered around at one scale and phenotypes are happening at a completely different scale but purely based on observations you connect them and then you try to make some sense out of it. Can we do something like that here? For that of course one has to think of features what features should we choose at the molecular level that might have their manifestations at the intercellular level. And then purely as a way of bookkeeping without any understanding at a priori just collecting data at the molecular level and then seeing their manifestations at the intercell communication level one can come up with a model and then one can test it by introducing different kinds of perturbations like you know some sort of mutants that changes the the the elastic property of the protein that we're talking about and let's see how does that reflect in the in the holistic outcome of the cell and then create that map to start out with as a computational tool because going real all physics multi-scale might not be the best way here possibly it's not even possible I don't think it's some some some scales become irrelevant when some other scales become important as as as someone was telling. So it's better to have to to find out if there exists any causal relationship that kind of those kind of you know feature selection and outcome selection if we can have that kind of a table made then might be one can have and enough data then one can have a map between these two. And finally one last point I would make is why would we not care about you know like as as was mentioned like you know finally when a when a complex gets made at the interface of the of the two membranes when when when this membrane adhesion happens we start only caring about that part not before that. Reason possibly is because anything that's happening before it is not rate determining. We are often interested in highly rate determining events something the slowest part of the system. Might be the diffusion of the proteins on the membrane despite its being you know very very interesting it might be the reason one haven't looked too much into it is because that diffusion process is not the slowest process in this entire cascade and and one is interested in the rate determining the slower processes and changing those kinetics in a way and and to see the effect of cell ECM interactions in that perspective. So these were my three point thought that if we can make a table when we don't have physics at least data science has taught us make a table. If we can make a table then from there we can learn something. So so yeah that would be my two cents.",

I know you have local specialists on mechanophore compounds that could be injected into the cell to read the tension profile. Also UIUC I think Paul and Anna Marie probably can back me up on those. UIUC have two of the our country's leading specialists in making mechanophore. That's Professor Jeff Moore and Nancy Sottos. So you might if you check them up you can see if any of their mechanophore can serve the purpose.",

And then you know we have these chemical tools that we've developed that fluoresce or create a signal once we've passed a certain force which is definitely at the level of you know cell and protein type forces. And then we're working with Ross Wang who's also you know here this year too and on our project where the ultimate goal is to then look at sort of a macro scale or at least a cellular scale phenomenon of cell migration and take it all the way from sort of the forces that bonds are experiencing in this tether to the sort of phenotypic output of that one protein force that's being felt to what the phenomenon is on the cellular scale of migrating. So I think like that's definitely something that came out of of this meeting and we're looking to to try to make a little bit of inroads at least on this specific topic between the nano scale and the macro scale. Um yeah so I thought that would maybe a progress report a plug our project or something but um switching gears a little bit to my own lab one thing that hasn't been brought up yet that we're really obsessed with is metabolism and signaling metabolites that are exchanged between different cell types different organs and even different species. So what's really hot right now is you know the microbiome and metabolites that are being secreted by this whole you know universe of microbes in our gut and how that affects our health. Um but it also shows up in sort of endocrine signaling within tissues where you have the immune system is something that we work on that communicates metabolically between different immune cell types and spurs on all sorts of different you know differentiation and response processes. So my questions with respect to metabolism here would be you know how how do we sort of trace the origins and receptors of signaling metabolites either between cell types species and organs and then I guess a dream that I had was you know how do we engineer technologies where we might be able to say you know use a bump and hole technique so we can create these labeled signaling metabolites in one species or one cell type and then trace them as they travel to different organs and actually get to the molecular level and see what receptors they're interacting with and how that sort of rewires all of these broader signaling pathways.",

So, you know, so in the case of the interaction between lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells, one of the critical phenomena is the formation of something called the immune synapse where, you know, MHC molecules and and and T cell receptors complex and what's been observed is that basically there are, you know, basically the entire protein complexes can basically transpose from one membrane to the next, right, based on this particular complex. And you can imagine that of course if you have a network of of of interacting cells, then that means that potentially you can have sort of a propagation of of translated proteins over a large length scale in a in a controlled way, right? Whereas of course, you know, once a cell releases a metabolite, it no longer has control over that metabolite. Nevertheless, if you have a network of antigen presenting and T cells that are that that have formed these specific immune complexes, then you could have sort of a a controlled transport of proteins over very very large length scales, even though the cells themselves are much smaller.",

I guess it's it's reasonable to kind of ask, okay, well, you know, if you have sort of, you know, some sort of membrane deformation, perhaps, you know, some there's some way in which the curvature of the membrane prevents, you know, there's some fundamental length scale limitation, but just that to the extent that membrane diffusion or diffusion, you know, around a membrane is is fast, then you'd expect that to happen.

Certainly, you know, immune synapses are are largely a function of the curvature between two membranes, but just that, you know, perhaps there are other determinants and, you know, and if you have that information, perhaps you'd be able to, you know, better define what is the relevant unit of abstraction, right?

But same with the ECM right? Don't the cells generate those molecules macromolecules and then like did this cell you know send out something and then did it go really far away and generate part of the ECM over there or does it stay like localized around that cell?

So this is what we're aspiring to do we're not there yet but but we have made some progress into at least connecting you know the structure to the mechanics which is something that not necessarily has been done. Uh with most people just use regular networks and not necessarily think about the the the architecture of that network that also obviously relates to the mechanical properties or the localized signals versus the the the bulk signals and and the the confinement within or the dynamics of how that network can respond to changes in a synthetic manner. So but but there's definitely a lot still to do to think about how to integrate the bio signaling into the physical models right and and then how you do that for each and every tissue and each and every environment because they're different.

Yeah so I mean one one big area is actually related a little bit to to what Stephanie mentioned before is thinking about when when there's an injury or trauma to the environment and especially in the context of a brain. So we've been looking at the extracellular matrix of the brain that is mainly laminin based and then how to think about making networks that would present these different types of cues of laminin but really what happens when something like traumatic brain injury or spinal cord injury happens right and then that scar is forming and that scar the tissue is completely the environment is completely changing and it's actually starts looking more and more like a collagen matrix although collagen is not a big player in in brain at least not collagen one. Um so what we've been able to do for example is make synthetic matrices that recapitulate that architectural trauma-based change where it's stiffer but it's also more bundling and it's tighter versus a loose soft network that would be more like brain. And when you culture cells especially the cells that are involved in the scar forming cells like astrocytes then you see the phenotype changing between when they are cultured on these bundled stiff matrices versus they're cultured on this more uniform soft matrices. But the real key was to be able to transition between these two states. So really where we come in is the dynamics of it. So can we take that stiff environment and dynamically alter it to the softer network and then what what would happen to the phenotypes of the cells? So we've seen that when you do that the cells actually can revert their phenotype from a very scar-forming reactive state to a quiescent normal state which means that the environment there is playing a huge role in the scar forming process and if we were to understand it better or even be able to control these transitions of the environment we might be able to think about reverting diseases or states like spinal cord or traumatic brain injuries. So but there's more to it than just the physics and architecture right there's the so so that's the beginning to unravel the really huge complexity of that.",
