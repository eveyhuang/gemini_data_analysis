How do you get and get all that information and all that different inputs and metabolites and other types of signaling that is changing all at once and kind of try and make sense of the noise because there's so much going on at once. So that will be my my little contribution to this discussion.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I want to comment on that off of everybody's discussion so far. And that I don't think we have an understanding of all this on all the length scales. Like on the nano scale, so I'm trying to understand this from the perspective of a protein. So like with Paul's example, if EGF is passing through the ECM, if it has to reach that receptor, from the perspective of the protein, a value of like stiffness that Michelle brought up, that's how the cell culturing people think of it. But from the perspective of the protein, is it really sensing a stiffness? It's sensing or it's seeing the surroundings as like heterogeneity in like the chemistry around it, the charges, the different forces it's feeling that way on smaller length scales. And it's also viewing the heterogeneity of like confinement and of these static or somewhat flexible barriers around it as well. So I don't think we've applied tools at the nano scale to the surroundings there. And I think we focused on, okay, when the EGF reaches the receptors, that's when we start using the nano scale tools inside, once it gets to the receptor on the membrane, the signaling cascade within the cell. But before that, it's just kind of assumed that like, oh, those metabolites or those signaling proteins, they make it there. And I don't think that's necessarily like true. It's more complex than we might assume of things just, oh, it just randomly diffuses and it makes it there.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, so I'll add as well. I was thinking earlier about that we have all this traction force microscopy that people do in vitro and that having something to know how a cell is actually pulling on its interacting with and pulling on its own environment if it's moving like during development or. And then I guess what Lydia just said made me think about, you know, like maybe so we do all these experiments where we like find the stiffness that cells prefer to crawl on or whatever, but really in vivo, they're probably just seeing what is around them. But like, I guess you could imagine during injury or things like that that they might be exposed to a scar or stiffer environment and like being able to understand like those edge cases of being on a normal versus beside a disrupted area, I think also like having tools to to probe that would be great.",

And so, you know, we can't we can't discount that either. So, so that's that's one element. And and just one little aside that I wanted to bring in is, you know, is it possible to have, you know, your your tool or, you know, sensing device or something that, you know, is on one cell. So you're basically still at that single cell environment, but you're looking at it and just obtaining the data from that cell, but it's within a a broader, more complex environment. And so I don't I don't know what the limitation are to, you know, the the different tools that people are using or developing, but, you know, that could be a way to get around, you know, well, what are all the cells doing at the same time and really just focus in on one specific, um, characteristic or cell or or even entity.",

So we covered the complexity as Michelle also concurred in the chat, the complexity of this topic from the dimension to functionality, to structure, to the interaction perspective. I want to share with you a little bit lighthearted uh true experience that I I have and I will push for the next topic a little bit. This is a true story. I received two letters from a cosmetic company who asked me for a graduate student who is well versed in the cell ECM interaction, which is right in the alley of the topic today. And then they want to hire them as a R&D specialist. So I recommended one of my student was rejected immediately. From his record, I could not believe the rejection. At least I would expect an interview. And finally, my departmental wisdom, he works on the more foundation funded uh project. My department senior colleagues who has much higher wisdom told me, ah, what they are seeking is young lady scientist who really understand the skin care as well as science. So with that, we succeeded. So for the cell ECM interaction to rejuvenate the skin is what they want. So, uh on that lighthearted notes, I won't disclose the company's name for fear of any political fallout, but they definitely have their preference on the topic. Uh, but the ECM cell interaction is of great importance. So, uh with that, I want to change the gears a little bit. If you can do one thing under this topic to solve one problem or develop one technology or making one discovery, whatever you like, what would that be? We will give you one more minute and we can go around. Paul will prompt you. I know.",
