Abhijit mentioned diffusion and Alison mentioned using metabolism. Another way of cell communication or cell-cell communication is specific, it's through the membrane nanotube that they can transport things. As a matter of fact, in one of my student's Lilian's experiment, she and Jackie from biomedical engineering found that if you put an older cell and a young cell together to form the membrane nanotube, the older cell can be rejuvenated, which is a great news I think for for this group. Paul and I love to mingle with the young people again. So, just a lighthearted comment, but we want to hear more of you about if you can do one thing. Thank you, Gary. Thank you. Yeah, so if you can do one thing in this topic, what would that be? Pipe dream welcome, current technology great. So, floor is yours.",

So, you know, so in the case of the interaction between lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells, one of the critical phenomena is the formation of something called the immune synapse where, you know, MHC molecules and and and T cell receptors complex and what's been observed is that basically there are, you know, basically the entire protein complexes can basically transpose from one membrane to the next, right, based on this particular complex. And you can imagine that of course if you have a network of of of interacting cells, then that means that potentially you can have sort of a propagation of of translated proteins over a large length scale in a in a controlled way, right? Whereas of course, you know, once a cell releases a metabolite, it no longer has control over that metabolite. Nevertheless, if you have a network of antigen presenting and T cells that are that that have formed these specific immune complexes, then you could have sort of a a controlled transport of proteins over very very large length scales, even though the cells themselves are much smaller.",

Any given antigen presenting cell can certainly complex with a very large number of T cells. And so, even though I'm not entirely sure if sort of like the actual measurement has been traced for any given molecule to to kind of, you know, trace that network, I'm just kind of arguing from first principles that it that it seems to I mean it must be happening at some rate. I guess it's it's reasonable to kind of ask, okay, well, you know, if you have sort of, you know, some sort of membrane deformation, perhaps, you know, some there's some way in which the curvature of the membrane prevents, you know, there's some fundamental length scale limitation, but just that to the extent that membrane diffusion or diffusion, you know, around a membrane is is fast, then you'd expect that to happen. And so, you know, so I guess, you know, our I mean I guess from sort of the one thing that I think would be really useful is to try, you know, try to understand, you know, what what are the determinants of, you know, of of what governs that length scale of of transport, you know, whether or not, you know, we, you know, it's just a question of measuring, right, you know, like the force exerted between membranes. Certainly, you know, immune synapses are are largely a function of the curvature between two membranes, but just that, you know, perhaps there are other determinants and, you know, and if you have that information, perhaps you'd be able to, you know, better define what is the relevant unit of abstraction, right? Whether or not, you know, perhaps it is just two cells or one cell, but, you know, but maybe it's under certain circumstances, it might be, you know, an order of magnitude higher.",

You can't do that with all the extracellular matrix proteins and identify where they're at.

I think Jim and I probably remember those movies. So at that time our computer technology weren't that good. The Hollywood got that from the video of mast cell degranulation.
