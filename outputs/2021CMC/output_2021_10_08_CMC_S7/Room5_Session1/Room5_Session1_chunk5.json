And I think that falls into we have a lot of data but like do we have enough replicates? And so I feel like often times in these problems we would like to use them more but I think like other people have been saying it's just how can this be best applied so how do you know without having this expertise like which approach might be best and how do we actually use it in a meaningful way? Because I feel like with a lot of these I don't even know where to get started. But I think it's clearly powerful it's just do we have I think often we were trying I had a student trying to machine learn something from our data and it was basically like we don't have enough data. So it's like how much data do we even need to even begin to apply because I think small data sets are very as people have already said are very biased and that's probably a problem. So I think that's kind of been from an experimental standpoint some of the hesitations we have when trying to even jump in.",

Because basically it was like our model was not very accurate. But you know it's just like I think even from an experimental standpoint when we're saying what fields could benefit or what you know what is the data I think part of that is like how much data do we need to get to even meaningfully use this? Like I don't have a feel for that still. Other than like is it just the answer is I need to go get thousands of patient samples and like is it just thousands? I don't know.

            "transcript": "Yeah I have a lot of thoughts on this but I guess I'll I guess I'll talk a little bit about my perspective on these questions as sort of these larger scales I think sort of related to maybe what what what Julian was talking about. So you know part of our work is is sort of more in the sort of mathematical biology world where a lot of the models are very large scale in the sense of like you know cellular networks so gene regulatory networks and signaling networks and in this field a lot of the models are trying to be you know not necessarily molecularly accurate because there's everybody acknowledges that we have tons of gaps but you know more can we capture the phenomenology so you know can we capture like the you know the particular sort of circuit dynamics that are going to you know appropriately describe what's you know what's happening you know with the data and actually be able to predict you know how this cell would act under a perturbation let's say even if we can't actually capture every single pathway and every single interaction in a signaling network for example. And so in what I see is that there is this this real sort of I don't know question of of forward or like what was it called like inverse versus forward modeling right so the forward model is all right you know we have a whole bunch of different papers that you know have a whole bunch of cartoons in them with different sort of mechanistic hypotheses about what this pathway is or whatever let's start building that into a model. We'll have a whole lot of issues with you know gaps in our where we don't know the parameters or whatever but we can start to model those things. And maybe if we're lucky we can we can kind of compete different models like that against each other and see which ones match the data better. And so I guess that would be sort of like a forward modeling problem but then in this field there's also been a lot of progress in the inverse modeling I don't know about machine learning but maybe some more sort of old-fashioned statistical inference approaches where people are doing Bayesian inference and kind of model selection against data and so I guess that's well I guess that actually sort of combines both right because you still have your sort of you still have your models that you start with and then you sort of compute those against the data. But I guess the issue is that you have such a if you have a lot of gaps in your knowledge of the system and you're still trying to capture some like fundamental properties of it then you have an issue which is that you're never going to be able to put in your space of models all the possibilities like you just you know there's like this universe of possible let's say like network structures that you know might be there that we don't know about yet and like you're never going to be able to capture those in all your models and so then I think there's this issue of you know this question of bias like like was brought up previously it's like well if I start you know with my best guess of what these systems are doing I'm going to have tons of gaps or I'm never going to be able to comprehensively model all the possibilities but on the other hand if I were to maybe just do a completely like sort of data-driven approach and try to have some you know new you know these great new algorithms that are that are somehow going to learn those dynamics from the data maybe they'll have their own biases which I'm not I'm no expert in that so I don't know what what those pitfalls are but that's what I'm thinking about.",

It's not to say that this is something that I have expertise in but you know some association with and I think that like I I kind of wanted to first just briefly touch on I guess questions five and six which are really about like you know what role do atomistic simulations play in understanding of the cell. And one question was like how big can they get how big and long can they get and the other one was should we be modeling things that are cell-sized at the atomistic level and I mean as an experimental biochemist who studies like protein-protein interactions and cell signaling I think it would be extraordinary if we could you know observe at you know some atomic level resolution the sort of structure and dynamics of like large protein complexes or you know multi-protein complexes operating in the context of a plasma membrane and it it I I just my sense is that this is very plausible now I think we're getting very close to that and it seems like the the the very few limitations that exist from a purely MD standpoint are I mean the obvious one is computational power right I mean and then with things like the membrane how well like do our force fields and parameters and stuff model the membrane but but I so my my naive answer to question F is like probably quite big and quite long you know we'll we're getting there. But I I actually wonder I'm curious to know from other people in the room whether there they see whether you all see a value in being able to model you know a whole cell or a whole organelle all the way down to the scale and resolution of atoms like is what is the I mean it's like it intrigues me intellectually but is there a value in that? And I'm actually just that's sort of like a question I wanted to pitch and then I'll have like a little comment to make about machine learning but I'm wondering if anyone wanted to just chime in and tell me if they think we should be doing EG. I don't know if anyone here in the room is doing that and it's not a criticism of your work I'm genuinely asking.",

That's that's that's what we don't know and I you know in the you know this is the context where people even worry like like I think Lu was mentioning maybe that you know worrying about quantum effects in you know cellular scale processes and I always you know I I I was I was not sure because you know we're hot things and quantum stuff should kind of basically go away I would naively think but then it was pointed out to me that you know biology is all about rare events too and so you know if you have some rare super fast thing that happens because of some quantum mechanical effect and that triggers some cascade of events that goes all the way up to I mean that's totally possible and entirely frightening to me at least because then I'm not sure we'll ever get anywhere.",
