            "transcript": "So I guess I would throw in a pitch for one of the things that I heard and because I was trying to ask the question is that even in this world of machine learning and data science that we still want to extract new physics new physics or new knowledge perspectives at the scales that we don't have access to, whether that's the middle scales or whatever you want to call it. And that there's still room for that. I also heard some people saying that there was room for modeling for for whether it's a whole cell or whole organism or and and then using those models from which to extract new insight. And and that that it's not like at the exclusion of the other.",
