If we could model a cell at the atomic level over a long time scale, would we even have the tools, the data analysis tools to catch these rare events and know what to make of them and to sort of interpret them as functionally important? I think that I had not thought about that until you just said it, but now I'm wondering. I mean because we our intuitively we would look for these, we would probably find all the molecules that were the same in identity and we would probably start off by just like averaging across their behavior from these all atom molecular dynamics simulations, you know. I don't think we would we wouldn't even intuitively think to look at the rare events and what their functional consequences are. Um, at least I wouldn't, but I'm not, it's not my expertise.",

So I'm wondering if I I think some people are doing that in the field although I didn't really pay attention.

Um and I'm a bioinorganic chemist so um what Nathan just said kind of captures my attention um and that is that force fields don't capture the behavior of metal ions. And so I don't that's just one example of how a particle I think if I understand correctly a particle-based model can't capture the the weirdness of real nature. Um and I'm sure I don't know what other examples there might be but I suspect that there are some. And I also was kind of thinking along the lines of what Lu said in that well maybe machine learning could could generate a force field or a or some kind of model that would better represent metal binding sites but the current problem is that most of the metal binding sites that we see in the PDB are for crystal structures of well-folded proteins and I think the frontier um well I I don't I mean maybe I'm biased but I think that there's a frontier on um trying to understand the metal binding sites that are present in the non-folded proteins or these intrinsically disordered proteins. So basically when the protein's folding around the metal ion or the metal ion changes the protein structure, um that data doesn't exist. And so we would need the data first to get the machine learning. So I think there we need physics-based approaches and maybe knowledge-based approaches as well. And data, lots and lots of data. That's all I have to say.",

Um is that still true like do you know are there good examples that you know where where the you know machine learning can still then go you know steps beyond the training set and and predict new new physics um or is it still sort of you know is that really a pitfall or not is that just like a a myth?",
