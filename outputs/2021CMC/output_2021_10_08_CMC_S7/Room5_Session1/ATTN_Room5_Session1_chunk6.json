If we could model a cell at the atomic level over a long time scale, would we even have the tools, the data analysis tools to catch these rare events and know what to make of them and to sort of interpret them as functionally important? I think that I had not thought about that until you just said it, but now I'm wondering. I mean, because we our intuitively we would look for these, you know, we would probably find all the molecules that were the same in identity and we would probably start off by just like averaging across their behavior from these all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. I don't think we would we wouldn't even intuitively think to look at the rare events and what their functional consequences are. At least I wouldn't, but I'm not, it's not my expertise.",

So if you don't have to evaluate all these like pairwise interactions, if it's just an analytical form and you know exactly, well I don't know if it will be an analytical form, but if it's much faster to evaluate the forces, maybe MD can go much bigger and much longer time scale. So I'm wondering if I think some people are doing that in the field, although I didn't really pay attention. But for MD I would say force field is always one of the big issues that limit the accuracy.",
