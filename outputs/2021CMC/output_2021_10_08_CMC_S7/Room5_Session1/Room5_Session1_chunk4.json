            "transcript": "talking about in the first session on how machine learning can accelerate discovery. The question is is that is are we so far into data science and machine learning and we believe that it's going to solve everything that we no longer should be using sort of bottom up physics-based models like all MD and or should we is there room for developing theories that are sort of would be like in the middle scales that would again be a different types of equations of motion or a different types of of descriptors that would then be modeled with course graining say or is is a is a one tool that people might say or knowledge-based methods or is it really just all data science now and it's going to be learning from the data and we don't need to do anything predictive. So so I was sort of trying to to suggest that maybe there's a reason for advancing in in combinations. I was hoping that the answer was yes that there is still room. but I but even just in the way that the conversation started everyone immediately went to just data science and machine learning as the answer. Nothing wrong with that but that's",

I mean you you can't I don't know I'm not a data scientist but I don't think that you can have you can be a data scientist without enough data if you don't have enough data.",

My my understanding from what you were saying is mostly at the structural biology molecular dynamics kind of level of question you you were you were touching on. And my what I wanted to the the when I read the prompt I I I thought about model a little higher scale model and the answer is definitely yes but maybe for the molecular dynamics and that level because the problems are very well defined and very well modeled maybe you can get to a point where where where you can reach this kind of a nice state where machine learning can do a lot of things right?

The other you can analyze those trajectories with machine learning using those trajectories as if they were a data science repository and then learn new rules. But the question is what what are the new rules that we learn and when we learn these new rules new higher level or collective models like the ones that you're saying that could be only a little bit removed from the molecular dynamics or could be very removed at much larger length scales should we start to developing new models? Are is there still room to developing uh collective sort of theories that that really tie things together which give us new equations that then become the the thing that we have to solve to understand that system. So or is it just that we give it to the computer it does its machine learning its neural nets and blah blah blah spits out answers and we don't need to know what happened in between. I don't want to be talking you asked me the question.",

Um because one thing I I um again I have limited experience with machine learning but then one thing I really don't like about it is it works but I don't know why it works. And I was like I I need to know whether there is a relation is it related to you know chemical environment electric fields or anything like that but there's nothing like this. It's it's like a they they have a collection of decision tree models and there's no such thing as oh I need an equation that says oh it's electric field squared plus this electric field so this thing is more important than the other but then at least my collaborator's model doesn't really tell me much about the physical insight. So that part I I really find annoying but maybe it's because my experience is limited and there are better ways of getting the the physics like in between it works and the fundamental thing itself.",

So I think that it these middle scales is where uh the things that you're trying to identify are probably exactly where it's really hard for us to intuit you know what those variables even are right? I think and I think that's to me where combining machine learning as maybe a state identifier right just as a way to intelligently course grain the system so that we can sort of deal with manageable pieces and then you know use use that knowledge to kind of build up from from I mean to me that's where we we try to use these kinds of methods is just as a way to to identify um constraints and states and things like that because I mean in in thermodynamics we have a very good prescription for how to do this right? We actually do this all the time where we go from microscopic states like positions and velocities and stuff and we know that there's a connection to pressure and we do that by maximizing entropy. But in these evolved systems we don't have that same way of of integrating right? So to me the machine learning part maybe is a tool to go and do that state identification. I mean we have a thing about methods here too where you know that's where I think maybe we can just let it be a black box. So we also do a lot of machine learning on data analysis right? We just want to and there it's sort of like we don't really care necessarily about the epistemology of what's going on inside but as long as it spits out something that looks like data we can analyze like a nice colorful micrograph it's okay. We we we but for modeling and understanding yeah I think these course graining to us is the missing link.",

Uh well you know I wanted to to to to to say something about the biases that that in machine learning and I was wondering my my question I wrote down is are we more biased or is the machine learning algorithms or like the machine learning methods more biased in the sense that is it going to just find what we want it to find and you know and and the same way as we are biased when we do it from the you know rules of of physics we just make assumptions or make simplifications that are definitely bring some bias in the in the models but I'm wondering if which method is more biased right? Because the data you there's only you can only get some kind of data right and it's already biased by what you can get as a data. So that you which will that will feed the the the machine learning model so that that was a question I don't have an answer for but something to think about.",

So there's a reason why when when I was in grad school I studied gene expression stochastic or you know gene expression things like that and I I sort of like kind of lost faith that we were ever going to be able to understand what's happening at the scale of the cell if I just know all the different like gene expression levels of all the genes in the cell. And so as a postdoc I started moving to like organelle biogenesis things that are at a higher scale. And now we're trying to kind of connect these things and it's yeah that's where we're having you know real intellectual challenges because everything's variable on both scales they obviously talk to each other and how these things map onto things like how big the cell is or how fast they grow it's very hard to intuit from a bottom up kind of model so yeah that's the",
