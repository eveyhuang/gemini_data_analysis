And it's it's interesting, my my background being in physics and then kind of moving more recently to biology, kind of some of the standards in biology, especially when using living animals, standards for biological replicates, transparency in in kind of rigor of using and and kind of describing error and making data open source that I think are great and perhaps not as strictly enforced in in other fields that that don't work with living systems. So I'm curious about, yeah, kind of like machine learning approaches in in what fields would be in what fields they would be most useful and perhaps it's the fields in which there is more data to access in which that data is kind of clearly presented as multiple replicates and and in which the annotation and the way that the data is archived is is kind of clearly made such that it could be consolidated for for machine learning. It's not an area that I do much active research in but it's certainly something that I've thought about when when trying to pull machine learning into some of the work that we do. That's great.

So definitely I I think the promise of machine learning is that we can do way more things than we can do previously. So and then the issue there I I find is the data definitely. And then how we provide the data, how accurate are the data and how we train the model. It's really I mean the limitation of machine learning is really how you teach it. It will it will come out as that model that you want which is a little bit annoying because if the data itself was only limited in one region of the phase space for example, the prediction would be more accurate in that phase space instead of the overall you know the real real prediction power. So that's what I find and I think it's it's really a joint force between theory and experiments to generate these good data. We like in our model we're relying on the protein data bank and we're trying to get the the top like 1% highest quality structures over there but then these are just experimental data. If there are high accuracy computational data, I think these would definitely be more useful. And we also find that if we give them data in this region of the the space we're interested in, you know the the model give us something really weird. But then just recently my student had some like they he had over a thousand data in the original space and then he generated like 10 in a new direction although we don't know which direction it is, it completely changed the machine learning model and its prediction. So that I think is a pitfall because as a user of machine learning model, we usually don't care about these stuff and then people really need to be careful about how they treat data, how they get the training data and whether they have kind of sampled the entire I don't know how you call it a space that for the prediction.",

The question is is that is are we so far into data science and machine learning and we believe that it's going to solve everything that we no longer should be using sort of bottom up physics-based models like all MD and or should we is there room for developing theories that are sort of would be like in the middle scales that would again be a different types of equations of motion or a different types of of descriptors that would then be modeled with course graining say or is is a is a one tool that people might say or knowledge-based methods or is it really just all data science now and it's going to be learning from the data and we don't need to do anything predictive. So so I was sort of trying to to suggest that maybe there's a reason for advancing in in combinations. I was hoping that the answer was yes that there is still room. but I but even just in the way that the conversation started everyone immediately went to just data science and machine learning as the answer.

So I think that it these middle scales is where uh the things that you're trying to identify are probably exactly where it's really hard for us to intuit you know what those variables even are right? I think and I think that's to me where combining machine learning as maybe a state identifier right just as a way to intelligently course grain the system so that we can sort of deal with manageable pieces and then you know use use that knowledge to kind of build up from from I mean to me that's where we we try to use these kinds of methods is just as a way to to identify um constraints and states and things like that because I mean in in thermodynamics we have a very good prescription for how to do this right? We actually do this all the time where we go from microscopic states like positions and velocities and stuff and we know that there's a connection to pressure and we do that by maximizing entropy. But in these evolved systems we don't have that same way of of integrating right? So to me the machine learning part maybe is a tool to go and do that state identification. I mean we have a thing about methods here too where you know that's where I think maybe we can just let it be a black box. So we also do a lot of machine learning on data analysis right? We just want to and there it's sort of like we don't really care necessarily about the epistemology of what's going on inside but as long as it spits out something that looks like data we can analyze like a nice colorful micrograph it's okay.

Because the data you there's only you can only get some kind of data right and it's already biased by what you can get as a data.

And so as a postdoc I started moving to like organelle biogenesis things that are at a higher scale. And now we're trying to kind of connect these things and it's yeah that's where we're having you know real intellectual challenges because everything's variable on both scales they obviously talk to each other and how these things map onto things like how big the cell is or how fast they grow it's very hard to intuit from a bottom up kind of model so yeah that's the",

        "transcript": "Yeah I have a lot of thoughts on this but I guess I'll I guess I'll talk a little bit about my perspective on these questions as sort of these larger scales I think sort of related to maybe what what what Julian was talking about. So you know part of our work is is sort of more in the sort of mathematical biology world where a lot of the models are very large scale in the sense of like you know cellular networks so gene regulatory networks and signaling networks and in this field a lot of the models are trying to be you know not necessarily molecularly accurate because there's everybody acknowledges that we have tons of gaps but you know more can we capture the phenomenology so you know can we capture like the you know the particular sort of circuit dynamics that are going to you know appropriately describe what's you know what's happening you know with the data and actually be able to predict you know how this cell would act under a perturbation let's say even if we can't actually capture every single pathway and every single interaction in a signaling network for example. And so in what I see is that there is this this real sort of I don't know question of of forward or like what was it called like inverse versus forward modeling right so the forward model is all right you know we have a whole bunch of different papers that you know have a whole bunch of cartoons in them with different sort of mechanistic hypotheses about what this pathway is or whatever let's start building that into a model. We'll have a whole lot of issues with you know gaps in our where we don't know the parameters or whatever but we can start to model those things. And maybe if we're lucky we can we can kind of compete different models like that against each other and see which ones match the data better. And so I guess that would be sort of like a forward modeling problem but then in this field there's also been a lot of progress in the inverse modeling I don't know about machine learning but maybe some more sort of old-fashioned statistical inference approaches where people are doing Bayesian inference and kind of model selection against data and so I guess that's well I guess that actually sort of combines both right because you still have your sort of you still have your models that you start with and then you sort of compute those against the data. But I guess the issue is that you have such a if you have a lot of gaps in your knowledge of the system and you're still trying to capture some like fundamental properties of it then you have an issue which is that you're never going to be able to put in your space of models all the possibilities like you just you know there's like this universe of possible let's say like network structures that you know might be there that we don't know about yet and like you're never going to be able to capture those in all your models and so then I think there's this issue of you know this question of bias like like was brought up previously it's like well if I start you know with my best guess of what these systems are doing I'm going to have tons of gaps or I'm never going to be able to comprehensively model all the possibilities but on the other hand if I were to maybe just do a completely like sort of data-driven approach and try to have some you know new you know these great new algorithms that are that are somehow going to learn those dynamics from the data maybe they'll have their own biases which I'm not I'm no expert in that so I don't know what what those pitfalls are but that's what I'm thinking about.",

It's not to say that this is something that I have expertise in but you know some association with and I think that like I I kind of wanted to first just briefly touch on I guess questions five and six which are really about like you know what role do atomistic simulations play in understanding of the cell. And one question was like how big can they get how big and long can they get and the other one was should we be modeling things that are cell-sized at the atomistic level and I mean as an experimental biochemist who studies like protein-protein interactions and cell signaling I think it would be extraordinary if we could you know observe at you know some atomic level resolution the sort of structure and dynamics of like large protein complexes or you know multi-protein complexes operating in the context of a plasma membrane and it it I I just my sense is that this is very plausible now I think we're getting very close to that and it seems like the the the very few limitations that exist from a purely MD standpoint are I mean the obvious one is computational power right I mean and then with things like the membrane how well like do our force fields and parameters and stuff model the membrane but but I so my my naive answer to question F is like probably quite big and quite long you know we'll we're getting there. But I I actually wonder I'm curious to know from other people in the room whether there they see whether you all see a value in being able to model you know a whole cell or a whole organelle all the way down to the scale and resolution of atoms like is what is the I mean it's like it intrigues me intellectually but is there a value in that? And I'm actually just that's sort of like a question I wanted to pitch and then I'll have like a little comment to make about machine learning but I'm wondering if anyone wanted to just chime in and tell me if they think we should be doing EG. I don't know if anyone here in the room is doing that and it's not a criticism of your work I'm genuinely asking.",

And so I don't that's just one example of how a particle I think if I understand correctly a particle-based model can't capture the the weirdness of real nature. Um and I'm sure I don't know what other examples there might be but I suspect that there are some. And I also was kind of thinking along the lines of what Lu said in that well maybe machine learning could could generate a force field or a or some kind of model that would better represent metal binding sites but the current problem is that most of the metal binding sites that we see in the PDB are for crystal structures of well-folded proteins and I think the frontier um well I I don't I mean maybe I'm biased but I think that there's a frontier on um trying to understand the metal binding sites that are present in the non-folded proteins or these intrinsically disordered proteins. So basically when the protein's folding around the metal ion or the metal ion changes the protein structure, um that data doesn't exist. And so we would need the data first to get the machine learning. So I think there we need physics-based approaches and maybe knowledge-based approaches as well. And data, lots and lots of data.

And that there's still room for that.
