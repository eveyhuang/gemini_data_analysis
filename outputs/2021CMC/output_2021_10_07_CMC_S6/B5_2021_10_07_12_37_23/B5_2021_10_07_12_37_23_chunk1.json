I guess that's now a new problem that that's it's now my job to disabuse people necessarily of that and hopefully in a way that is constructive. I guess our goal is to try to figure out how to use this resource to really push the frontier of what we know about protein folding because as I would I think say and probably many of you would agree that AlphaFold is a structure prediction tool not really a protein folding tool but we think that it can help us learn a lot about protein folding and we have some ideas that we're currently working on in that thread that I'd like to share with you guys and hopefully we can I can sort of get some of your thoughts and feedback on that.",

So we are interested in hydrogen bonding in proteins and their functions especially very short hydrogen bonds where quantum effects might be important. And then we recently developed a machine learning model that uses some of the structural chemical and sequence information to predict the presence of them. Although you know the prediction power was not that great because there are not enough experimental high resolution experimental data for us to to train the data. So ideally we want we want to move forward with not only just predicting their presence but also how they impact the environment around them say the the protein active site structures and and stuff like that and their functions.",

For example immune response predictions genome mutation impact and network structure all of that. So I think the immediate goal I would say in the next in the near future would be to generate a chemical genetic interaction map. So that is really to facilitate precision medicine. So now I think the big question is like hey you have a patient coming into clinic with a new mutation we identify and doctor ask them to do a panel sequencing all of that. They did that and after that we don't know anything what to do next. So hopefully we can come up with a lookup table that you have these mutations and then their you know kind of associated unique drug and we can provide this is totally based on many different set of experiments that we can map to generate. And now it's like coming into a scale that we can manage a large number. Hopefully this will be the short term dream that we can achieve.",

And interesting AI ML is whether we can use that to guide the design or control or predict protein synthesis in those systems. And recently we've been trying to create I think what Rigoberto say about um spiral feedback. Um we're trying to get into studying how membrane protein get into membrane and what we discovered what we found was that there's no not much data around that. So when there's no data we start to do AI ML and when there's no systematic database um how do you get that spiral feedback to get started. Um so a lot of what I see in proposals and research these days are a lot of a lot of based on available information but um creating new spiral feedback is um challenging.",
