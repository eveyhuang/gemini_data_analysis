      "transcript": "But like in terms of sort of more unstructured data sets like let's say ribosome profiling data or the stuff that I do proteomics like that'd be really nice if we had a way to remove noise. I would love to be able to say what in this big data set should I believe more seriously versus what's maybe more at the edge of noise and that I think is probably it goes back to what we were saying which was having really good databases that are really well curated is a beautiful thing for experimentalists and it's an even more beautiful thing for machine learners. But you know how do we create those standards that everyone agree to that's sort of like this is that level of quality and then when there is noise what do you do with it?",

      "transcript": "So we there's two things I wanted to bring up. We have nine minutes and so Stephen has to sort of figure out what he wants to report out from this conversation. And the second thing is I'm concerned that we sort of have gotten into a naughty Nash equilibrium which is that the only answer is we need more data and we need more computer time to analyze that data. Could we have something more than just that we need more data or better data or better databases? I mean I think we've had a lots of discussions where we had the possibility of maybe a different types of unknowns and maybe we could emphasize those as well.",

      "transcript": "But I think there is a broader lesson about working together to put forward the best data and cooperating better and having standards. And I think that's not just something that's like oh we need more data but it's also we need to come together as communities that focus on certain types of experiments to come up with standards. And I think that for me that's a big takeaway.",

We don't want to talk about materials because we're talking about chemical machinery of the cell. So what are the objects that we would want in that database to accelerate our understanding of the cell?",
