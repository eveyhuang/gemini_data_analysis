      "transcript": "Yeah, so that's we've been working on that actually. That's not published but for the past I would say three to five months now. So you know exactly because excitement by AlphaFold. So at the beginning, you know, when you first check the mutant and wild type form, so oh yeah there's no change, almost the same. But actually for people who are very familiar with PDB I think Abhishek may may know this more than me, you are able to do generate a score, a quantitative score that compare the sequence similarity and sequence structural similarity or structural differences. You know it's when you rotate the structure from you know the current position 90 degrees rotating, you see this different. No, they are the same. So you have to have a way to quantify. So there is way that we can somehow see that single point mutation can really do generate the structural differences. I think you can look at that more for structure differences, folding and other things. We we we just started but I think there are for sure some interesting thing that AlphaFold can offer even in terms of protein folding too. At least we can see some sort of thing on the protein surfaces because we are interested more in interactions. And then you see some sort of structural surface changes obviously and then by the you know the structural alignment score you can say yes it is really a real change.",

      "transcript": "So actually my feeling is a bit different. I would not like to think about the 10 years in future with AlphaFold. I would like to think about the 10 years in future with Google, with what the CEO of Google is thinking might be potentially once he has gotten AlphaFold out. So now if we think in that direction, where did AlphaFold come from? The reason we really like this because we essentially have a a statistical mechanics kind of a mindset which really really kind of gets us into neural networks and and this sort of a multi-sequence alignment. So essentially as a community we were already highly biased on which this 500 million dollars investment is now being it's a we are we are return on investment. So in a way that's my way of thinking. Now let's think from a different side. Where did machine learning the way we are thinking over the last 20 years come from? The first wave was in 1960s where already Boltzmann motors not Boltzmann generator but Boltzmann motors were generated. There's a second wave in 1980s and this is the third wave of machine learning holding the hands of GPUs. So from where I like to think is algorithms biology. There are seven different entry points of machine learning. Anything and everything that we are doing right now is the machine learning of neural networks is brain. How does the brain work? That is one way and we are what we are trying to do is we are trying to cast all our problems essentially in terms of how our brain thinks. There are six other ways. I've forgotten the names of the six others. One of them is quantum sensing. There are reviews in algorithms biology of these seven ways. Three of them doesn't even have mathematical theorems derived. Let go of like it hasn't even reached computer science. It's in the applied math realm. So I think of machine learning it's heavily biased by our interpretation of things. It's a virtual machine. So our interpretation is statistical mechanical which goes very nicely with this neural gas and and so this this is so this is very very good and therefore okay now now now coming down to to AlphaFold I think therefore the next if we follow this track I would invite everyone to look into the six other tracks. But if we follow this track I think can we can we look into dynamics which is what I'm very very interested in. In fact if you go to AlphaFold they have a similar kind of work on dynamics on the website. They have been only able to train on three particle dynamics. They haven't been able to go beyond that. And not only that one thing we are forgetting is training happens on TPUs not GPUs. Very very highly sophisticated hardware which is not available on any public supercomputer in the country. It's only available with as a part of Google Colab otherwise not. So so I think dynamics would be extremely important to learn. The question is should we learn dynamics with neural networks with the way we are thinking about our brain thinks about things. Is that the ansatz to follow or should we think of other ways of machine learning all together? And I think that's where I think we we we need to as biologists we can contribute because we know from from this from this biological side how does nature use seven algorithms. If we can treat this problem these seven that way then possibly it's going to be easier. I I know the reason of doing neural networks LSTMs GANs the different kinds of objects also because now they are available there's a lot of implementation. But can we think of it beyond that? I would say that's what possibly the sorry go ahead.",

      "transcript": "I was gonna say so Stephen Yi I know your hand is up and I'm gonna push on some of the others who haven't spoken and then I'm gonna before I have you speak and I'm gonna stimulate them a little bit to to try to address the question. I know Davide has a lot of thoughts on this and maybe Lu or Chinmay as well. So in this protein folding business one question is if I have a structure or whatever what's I mean if I have a sequence what's the structure etcetera right? That's the sort of naive structural question which AlphaGo is answering. You could also do and people have been using machine learning I mean neural nets to propagate structures. So you can demonstrate that you can at least with simple all-atom models you can learn a little bit of how to propagate from knowing our existing trajectories and propagate them. So you might even be able to use an AI to propagate a large protein and to be an integrator. And what Abhishek has kind of suggested is maybe that's that's like the obvious thing for us to do. We have an integrator let's make a better integrator that uses the machine that is faster. But is there a different way in which we could think about dynamics or what's happening between these two knowing the sequence and knowing the structure that would give us more information or different information that would be a different question that we need to address. So I'm wondering what you all think about that and and that's my and I picked on Davide and I warned him he was going to be the next person I was going to pick on.",

      "transcript": "I I'm totally ignorant of the relevant questions in the field that's my limitation here. So I see this so I was not pissed off about AlphaFold at all I don't care. It doesn't scoop me. I'm not trying to fold anything. But I see this as an opportunity and I'm still thinking in terms of of what Rigoberto was saying so this is a new set of tools that we can apply to answer more complex questions than just sequence versus structure. And one can go the the the next little step is to look at metastability and in in different environments. Because I mean you just don't have the protein in a solvation box and that's it. I think in in real life you you have different types of environments which probably affect the structure as well, partial folding or stuff like that. So that goes back to again using these tools with old tools like molecular dynamics but I'm still in the in the Boltzmann world I haven't gone out of that.",
