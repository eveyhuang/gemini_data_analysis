We sort of need to see that replicated pretty much throughout the scientific community for across every domain, right?

And that's part of like why it's been so you know good and there's just no real equivalent of that for like lipids or small molecules where you're basically relying exclusively on the experimentalist or the structural biologist's interpretation of their density because there isn't really a ground truth of what a ligand or a lipid should look like in quite the same way.",

So there is a certain amount of bias that has come out of known stoichiometry which creates an information bottleneck. These additional information you have to contact the experimentalist and then they'll give you what are the parts that they haven't submitted to the PDB which actually the physics will really benefit from. So and and and more and more so as you move from X-ray crystallography to cryo-EM where the data resolution is lower these the the population of these uncertain parts are increasing. And therefore PDB actually has a separate outlet called PDB-Dev where these uncertain things go in without as much curation and so if people are good enough if people want to do it then you can find the reflection of a PDB submission in PDB-Dev and there you can find those other information.",

Uh like essentially uh uh given a training set there are cross validation methods that can be used to check how good the quality of learning is. Uh what I find difficult is uh how do I validate generation things that I have not learned in the training set for example in the in the spike work that Rommie did they actually with Arvind they actually did uh went into a reduced space found some new confirmations that were not in the training set but that had to be validated which they did actually separately. Uh so something like that will have to be uh uh will have to be thought of number one. So I think uh how do we how do we validate generated models uh that's one point. And again when it's dynamics I would I would uh uh like to stress a bit the predictions that we were talking about Rigoberto they were what you call non non-generative models where you actually have to guide dynamics with dynamics to get the future. Uh essentially can we uh have generative dynamics like where we don't uh essentially feed the answer to get another variant of that answer where we start out with some sort of constraints and allow the the the model to to generate all sorts of answers and then validate it. So I think that's where uh uh I would I would say the training problem is not I think the bottleneck is the training problem is how you train things that depends on interpretation. Uh given a data let's say coordinate a molecule how do I tell a computer that it's a molecule do I give it all atom coordinates do I give it the dihedral angles do I give it the bonds and the angles do I give it like what what feature feature selection I think training is a simple process as long as we know how what feature do we choose and I think that's where most of the intelligence goes in of a researcher.",
