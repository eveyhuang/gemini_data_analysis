But so I'm we're not upset by AlphaFold but something I thought maybe just philosophically speaking is when when there's a lot of data available and where if there's enough commercial interest in generating an AI machine learning based on that model, AlphaFold or a similar thing is bound to happen that it's hard for a single academy lab to compete with something like Google. That's what I thought from the field dynamic. But also related to Lu Wang's question, I agree. So what my lab has been trying to do is can we generate data that look at how chemical condition affect function of protein or or say the interaction with other protein and then be able to generate that data at high throughput and then use that kind of data to really advance study of proteins. So that kind of data to me does not yet exist in the database based on my understanding but others can correct me.",

So I think one key limitation is the the the quality and the completeness of the data provided for AlphaFold or for any anybody to model per se. I think because of the so many different factors involved that Lu mentioned like the environment and chaperone binding because I was working with Susan Lindquist on the protein folding before as well. So that's very important for the folding part and chaperone involvement. So all of that may be not really in there when they were modeling all of these structures before. So I think all of that you know one one key thing that we got from this ISCB like International Society of Computational Biology meeting just last month was exactly this. So it's it's limited now by the kind of data available to us. So that's why we have always room to improve in the future keep evolving all of that and then new generation of algorithms and data will be coming. Okay that's my comment.",

So I think machine learning gives that uh gives that way of of figuring out the known unknowns when you're talking to experimentalists even beyond the physics models that we often are so used to learning from.

And I think that the reason why this doesn't work as well as let's say something like AlphaFold I think it kind of like boils down to like how good is the experimental data that you're trying to train off of. Like AlphaFold had the PDB. The PDB was just an amazing resource that has been accumulating for 50 years has you know all of these like you know forms of QC that are incorporated into the pipeline. You know we don't really have a database of that quality for all types of experimental data. And if we did I guess what the AlphaFold story has taught us is that we probably could create really powerful AIs to predict things but it's just like how good are we as a community at sort of putting all of our experimental data together so that the ML gurus can then go to town you know.",

The problem is that they're it's expensive because if you think about even just one structure occupies a fair amount of of space and then if you how many slices do you have? I can easily fill up terabytes of space with just a small trajectory of only a small amount of time with only you know it's very so so this is challenged by that.",

If I train the same observations as a competition between observations it's a different kind of data. So it's my interpretation. I can give you like so many results out of the same data set by interpreting it differently.
