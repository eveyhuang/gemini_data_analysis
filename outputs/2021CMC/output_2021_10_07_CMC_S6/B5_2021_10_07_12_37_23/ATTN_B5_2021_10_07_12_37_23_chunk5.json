We sort of need to see that replicated pretty much throughout the scientific community across every domain, right? So those conversations need to happen because even just that next step of, okay, how does a small molecule bind? That should be like right there, right next. And again, we're like, there's really very little well-curated data on that.",

So that kind of self-corrects for when the density is a little wonky here or there. And that's part of why it's been so good. And there's just no real equivalent of that for lipids or small molecules where you're basically relying exclusively on the experimentalist or the structural biologist's interpretation of their density because there isn't really a ground truth of what a ligand or a lipid should look like in quite the same way.",

So there is a certain amount of bias that has come out of known stoichiometry which creates an information bottleneck. These additional information you have to contact the experimentalist and then they'll give you what are the parts that they haven't submitted to the PDB, which actually the physics will really benefit from. So and more and more so as you move from X-ray crystallography to cryo-EM where the data resolution is lower, these the population of these uncertain parts are increasing. And therefore PDB actually has a separate outlet called PDB-Dev where these uncertain things go in without as much curation. And so if people are good enough, if people want to do it, then you can find the reflection of a PDB submission in PDB-Dev and there you can find those other information.",
