I do imagine a direct imaging of of biomolecules and so you know so an atom scope, a full atom scope of the entire cell is that's a a little bit far out there for me. So I'll I'll hedge and say, okay, if we could image at one micron and actually really do a very detailed inventory of what's in a one micron voxel or one micron cubed voxel, you know and and actually deliver that in five to eight years and and you know compositionally detailed, you would get the endogenous proteoforms that are the enzymes, that information. You would collect the substrates and products present in that voxel. So it would be somewhat local. And then the computational support, I think there are big efforts to say, well now I can layer known protein complex information onto this knowledge and and that's now I'm not now I'm not sounding particularly well thought out but that's kind of anyway that's what came out Gang-Yu.",

            "transcript": "Yeah I I just I I keep coming back to what Wenjing said earlier on about really making a series of measurements that probe different aspects of an enzyme's function and then basically figuring out how to integrate them. And so like from my perspective as somebody who studies kinases and phosphatases, I would want to be able to say over the course of some cellular process, can I do one experiment where I measure you know subcellular localization as a function of that process, another where I overlay on top of that intrinsic enzyme activity as a function of that same process, right, which may not necessarily be correlated because in some locale maybe the enzyme's inhibited or whatever, right? And then um so that second thing may come from like a product producing biosensor or something like that. And then the third thing might be mapping uh what it's interacting with as a function of you know space and time. And so whether that's products or that are being formed, other substrates that are being acted upon, or uh regulatory proteins or something. If you had those three pieces of measurement um over the same like sort of biological process, I think you could learn an enormous amount about what um that enzyme is actually doing and how it operates. And then the fourth kind of dream thing would be to be able to map onto that the conformational dynamics of the protein as a function of all these things but uh and that's something as a structural biologist I would love to be able to do but um you know we wear different hats in our lab so um yeah I I none of those are a proposal for a specific technology but if there are four technologies that we could merge into one thing, that would be like for example if I was going to pitch a project to this group, that's what I would pitch and I would just pitch my favorite enzyme because it would help us out. Um but yeah, that's my thought.",

            "transcript": "several thoughts. So first I just want to say I think some of what we were talking about before this last comment by Neel could be called chemical imaging or has been called by other people and where you have atomic scale resolution so you're imaging specific bonds and I don't know of a technique that can do that label-free or on small number of molecules right that's that's the challenge. So you can do chemical imaging but you need a lot of the same number of molecules so that you have high signal. If you have a very heterogeneous environment like the cell with it's you know that's harder to do and then you need a probe but then you need to get the probe into the cell so that's the challenge. But I also had another thought so I hope it's okay I'm totally changing direction. So you know in some sense we want kind of cellular or sorry atomic resolution or molecular resolution be able to to tell structure of individual molecules within the cell. On the other hand fundamentally I think processes within cells must be stochastic so that many random events are happening at once and not each of those events is meaningful right maybe it's binding non-specifically. So in that sense we actually want to be able to probe many different molecules so that we can see what the average behavior is. So it just something that came to mind maybe it's obvious to people who regularly think about biological processes but you know that's kind of a dichotomy just mapping what one individual molecule is doing for some very small amount of time may not give you an actually true any sort of information it might just be random.",

And then I think yeah one of the questions on this session was thinking about like oh single cell technologies versus in bulk is that like the same thing happening on a molecular level here where you know cryo-EM or whatever we're like averaging we like lose all that information like what Masha was just saying of like this one's doing one thing and something's doing another thing and then if we average it are we like we don't have any information about what actually is happening like the average structure is like not even what other ones look like or I don't even know.",

But I just think what Masha mentioned is so many interesting biology signaling we want to study in an integrated way of a cascade of biology process including protein translocation or enzymatic activity and also within a very ideally a small compartments and to avoid the heterogeneity in the cells maybe just in a small level. But question is to study those complex process we are constantly testing or challenging the bandwidth of multiplex imaging because the read out is only one you know people rely on FRET or fluorescence and we might need to use like multiple probes to track different protein or even for protein at different organelles right? And then so can we do that actually like people doing flow cytometry to study just cell surface marker people can put 12 different biomarkers detecting 12 different fluorescence channels right? Is the current probe design available now to like a toolkit allow us to simultaneously track more than a dozen interesting points there.",
