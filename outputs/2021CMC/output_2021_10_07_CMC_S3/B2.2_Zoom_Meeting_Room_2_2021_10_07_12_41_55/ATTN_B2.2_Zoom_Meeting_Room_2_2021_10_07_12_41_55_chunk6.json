      "transcript": "Yeah, I'm just thinking a lot of the probes we have now, biosensors, for example, the classic calcium biosensors or you know, lipid biosensors, phosphatidylinositol, are binding proteins that bind calcium or bind to a phospholipid. And you know, we have this amazing technology now of nanobodies and nanobody libraries that can be displayed on yeast and and I'm and then also this technology of taking two different binding sites and putting them together so that you could have heterozygous binding sites as opposed to the classic antibody that has you know, exactly the same antigen for both things and that would bring proteins together. So I'm wondering if anybody's thought about using nanobodies and screening for creating molecules that bind to your favorite chemical or would be called a hapten as opposed to an antigen.",
