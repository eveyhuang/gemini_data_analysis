I also like my lab does a lot of in vitro biochemistry and we're starting to think about how you look at our favorite enzymes in in the cell and you know we it seems like a lot of the in-cell enzymology techniques that are out there I think as maybe Stephanie pointed out first it's really focused on the products. Like what are the enzymes making can you detect the formation of a product in space and time and that's the information a lot of people are after from a cell biology point of view. But like you know our lab we're largely interested in you know when this thing is happening or a particular product is forming in the cell at a particular space and time what does the enzyme look like how is its conformation changing is that information we care about? And I kind of want to pose that question to the group that do we care actually is this an enzyme-centric discussion or is it a product-centric discussion? I I'm I don't care either way I just think it's an interesting thing to...",

Like I kind of want to know what it looks like you know what conformation it's in when it's bound to these proteins in the cell and how that dictates its enzyme activity. But I also want to know what this enzyme is acting on because in the case of the enzymes we study they're relatively promiscuous they don't just make one product but they phosphorylate a dozen proteins or something. So everyone's system is different so I'm just curious where we all stand and whether we have a common set of things we want to learn about enzymes you know in the cell or not.",

I think now people make the single molecule FRET spectroscopy and also have the high photon based single atom imaging inside cells. For to answer your question about the enzyme I'm very big fan of the enzyme activity but I also in another different angle was very interesting a very fundamental question about protein folding. So it's always takes like picosecond to nanosecond it's very quick dynamics and the folding and denaturing in in the cell environment that's something very interesting too.",

I feel like my biggest questions relate to how other proteins affect the function of the protein that I'm studying or we're studying. And so that's where being able to do it in a cellular environment is of course ideal. And I think for enzymes that are well well enzyme classes that are better studied I would say like you know enzymes that modify DNA or enzymes like kinases we have more chemical tools but for other enzyme families it's very hard to study them sometimes because you know you can't there's not a good toolbox of substrates. And a lot of the like you were saying when fluorescence is a readout a lot of the chemical tools that we have access to are just labels they're not substrates or analogs or products. So yeah I think we're somewhat limited there.",

It's like a little puff of very fast light to excite water and it like little little like two two micron little voxels on a side poof you can liberate the material without much vibrational excitation. That might be a way to to get the sample that is minimally perturbed without labels and then I don't know what you do with it but maybe that could be scaled down and made smaller. But I really I really violently agree with what you were talking about Neel not just because you have a great name Neel. But your your thoughts around like a kinase okay kinase is hitting its its serine and phosphorylating it right very promiscuous in vitro. But boy when you have 10 or 20 of its friends in a complex it gets very specific. And that's my view of the proteome or enzymes in it and it's all this so I don't necessarily want to study for 20 years biochemical you know in vitro I want to get at the function I want to get at the relevance. And so you know how do I do that I guess.",

            "transcript": "Could I I wanted to jump on that you know so when in in the kinase field there's a lot of I mean as Tania pointed out it's a well-studied class of proteins and so people have developed these really phenomenal biosensors right they're proteins usually based on two fluorescent proteins that undergo some sort of change in FRET intensity as a function of the kinase phosphorylating that that sensor. And so that's like a really common design that a lot of groups use. And what I've and I think they're great because you know you can see some sort of FRET signal change throughout the cell as a function of space and time and but those are not the endogenous substrates of that kinase right? And so I I often find myself wondering whether we miss something about the specific product that yields some functional outcome for the cell and whether that's being phosphorylated at the same sort of like time and in the same space that these sensors are. Because you see an uptake in the actual intrinsic activity of the enzyme somewhere at some point in time is that really where functional outcomes are produced in the cell? I think that's a big open question. And so we can map in optics and enzyme activity but if if the substrates that ultimately produce a phenotype are not there what like it doesn't matter right? And so I think like an ideal sensor would be one that is effectively on the endogenous product or is the endogenous product and somehow you'd be able to visualize that product forming the true product forming as a as a function of whatever parameters you're interested in which which I appreciate is like a tall order and that's the point of this conversation but yeah.",
