And just have a peek at this and jot down some thoughts or your how you parse this in the context of your own experience. And then we'll we'll we'll come back together and start to mix it up. So take take 90 seconds till 10:44. I'm going to stop talking, which is hard for me, but I will stop talking.",

So we're and it's really aligned with the CMC theme for the the whole meeting and so you know in in the year 2121 thinking about 2025 and beyond, you know what do you what what thoughts come to mind? Does someone have a you know really want to go on a riff and you you've you know this hits a hot button or want to share something very directed?",

And then there are some ways to get around that but those are very challenging to work with in sort of warm, wet, and noisy biological systems.",

You essentially assume a static structure, do a sequential build up bits of that structure through sequential images and then combine them to reconstruct the structure. It is a reconstruction method not an imaging method. But if you want to follow dynamics, you know, it's much much slower than like say a catalytic cycle. It looks at sort of slow structural rearrangements by building up a reconstruction.",

            "transcript": "Sorry Neil. No, I was just trying well it's it's always when you smash together people who think across scales or maybe it's good to define a scale. Like some people are thinking like super detailed physical organic chemistry concepts along the reaction channel, highly controlled in vitro. And there's incredible smarts that go into that to get down to like the hydrogen bond level thinking and when you just heard the cell biologist talk it's like okay we're willing to sacrifice a lot of those things. And so if you you know to to maybe just look at the product as a particular product of a reaction and know where it is because it moves from the nucleus to the cytoplasm or whatever. So what along that axis you know where what would you have to sacrifice to get it to get to let's say single molecule what does that mean single molecule enzymology in a living cell? But not you know you have to sacrifice some things right? And so what are those things and how much would you have to sacrifice?",

They're like always in the nucleus. That's where the genomic DNA is. So I kind of cheat with like the subcellular localization. But yeah I was thinking about the readout and like for all of our assays the readout is fluorescence in some way and so we we usually use like flow cytometry to to look at fluorescence and that's like related back to to enzymatic activity. We don't do in vitro stuff because there's like 50 repair proteins that are all involved in a given pathway and so we can't like express and purify all of those. So that's why we like have to do it in the context of a cell. But then like our DNA substrate is one that we like made in a test tube and then put into the cell so it's not actually genomic DNA. And then people have issues with that. They're like it's not chromosomal, it's like not wrapped up in histones. So we have to sacrifice that.",
