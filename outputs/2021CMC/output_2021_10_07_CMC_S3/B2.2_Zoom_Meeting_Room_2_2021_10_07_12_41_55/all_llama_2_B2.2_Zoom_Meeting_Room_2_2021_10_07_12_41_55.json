But yeah I was thinking about the readout and like for all of our assays the readout is fluorescence in some way and so we we usually use like flow cytometry to to look at fluorescence and that's like related back to to enzymatic activity. We don't do in vitro stuff because there's like 50 repair proteins that are all involved in a given pathway and so we can't like express and purify all of those. So that's why we like have to do it in the context of a cell. But then like our DNA substrate is one that we like made in a test tube and then put into the cell so it's not actually genomic DNA.

And so that's where being able to do it in a cellular environment is of course ideal. And I think for enzymes that are well well enzyme classes that are better studied I would say like you know enzymes that modify DNA or enzymes like kinases we have more chemical tools but for other enzyme families it's very hard to study them sometimes because you know you can't there's not a good toolbox of substrates. And a lot of the like you were saying when fluorescence is a readout a lot of the chemical tools that we have access to are just labels they're not substrates or analogs or products.

But your your thoughts around like a kinase okay kinase is hitting its its serine and phosphorylating it right very promiscuous in vitro. But boy when you have 10 or 20 of its friends in a complex it gets very specific.

And so that's like a really common design that a lot of groups use. And what I've and I think they're great because you know you can see some sort of FRET signal change throughout the cell as a function of space and time and but those are not the endogenous substrates of that kinase right? And so I I often find myself wondering whether we miss something about the specific product that yields some functional outcome for the cell and whether that's being phosphorylated at the same sort of like time and in the same space that these sensors are. Because you see an uptake in the actual intrinsic activity of the enzyme somewhere at some point in time is that really where functional outcomes are produced in the cell? I think that's a big open question. And so we can map in optics and enzyme activity but if if the substrates that ultimately produce a phenotype are not there what like it doesn't matter right? And so I think like an ideal sensor would be one that is effectively on the endogenous product or is the endogenous product and somehow you'd be able to visualize that product forming the true product forming as a as a function of whatever parameters you're interested in which which I appreciate is like a tall order and that's the point of this conversation but yeah.",

But I guess often times this enzymatic activity or signaling processes are so complex, so there's just no single tool that can answer all the questions. So that's why we have these in vitro method and in vivo method. Even for in vivo method for one enzyme, so you want to study the substrate input and the enzyme itself and its product, and product is affecting even like downstream enzyme or other proteins. So the nice thing is I guess it's possible to develop a sensor or method for at each step or each level and then so we cannot in the end eventually possibly we can combine all these views together and to have a more complete holistic picture of the whole process. Like for the problem I'm studying GPCR signaling, so we need to study when the ligand for GPCR is being released, time and space is important, and the GPCR itself whether it responds to it because whether the concentration is right or not. So you not only need to look at the ligand, you also need to look at the GPCR, and then once it's being activated and then its own post-translational modifications and it affects G proteins and downstream like secondary messenger effects. So all the good thing is there are people designing sensors for like each step of this process that I guess enable to to study like all of these together.",

And so like from my perspective as somebody who studies kinases and phosphatases, I would want to be able to say over the course of some cellular process, can I do one experiment where I measure you know subcellular localization as a function of that process, another where I overlay on top of that intrinsic enzyme activity as a function of that same process, right, which may not necessarily be correlated because in some locale maybe the enzyme's inhibited or whatever, right? And then um so that second thing may come from like a product producing biosensor or something like that. And then the third thing might be mapping uh what it's interacting with as a function of you know space and time. And so whether that's products or that are being formed, other substrates that are being acted upon, or uh regulatory proteins or something. If you had those three pieces of measurement um over the same like sort of biological process, I think you could learn an enormous amount about what um that enzyme is actually doing and how it operates. And then the fourth kind of dream thing would be to be able to map onto that the conformational dynamics of the protein as a function of all these things but uh and that's something as a structural biologist I would love to be able to do but um you know we wear different hats in our lab so um yeah I I none of those are a proposal for a specific technology but if there are four technologies that we could merge into one thing, that would be like for example if I was going to pitch a project to this group, that's what I would pitch and I would just pitch my favorite enzyme because it would help us out.

So first I just want to say I think some of what we were talking about before this last comment by Neel could be called chemical imaging or has been called by other people and where you have atomic scale resolution so you're imaging specific bonds and I don't know of a technique that can do that label-free or on small number of molecules right that's that's the challenge. So you can do chemical imaging but you need a lot of the same number of molecules so that you have high signal. If you have a very heterogeneous environment like the cell with it's you know that's harder to do and then you need a probe but then you need to get the probe into the cell so that's the challenge. But I also had another thought so I hope it's okay I'm totally changing direction. So you know in some sense we want kind of cellular or sorry atomic resolution or molecular resolution be able to to tell structure of individual molecules within the cell. On the other hand fundamentally I think processes within cells must be stochastic so that many random events are happening at once and not each of those events is meaningful right maybe it's binding non-specifically. So in that sense we actually want to be able to probe many different molecules so that we can see what the average behavior is. So it just something that came to mind maybe it's obvious to people who regularly think about biological processes but you know that's kind of a dichotomy just mapping what one individual molecule is doing for some very small amount of time may not give you an actually true any sort of information it might just be random.",

But question is to study those complex process we are constantly testing or challenging the bandwidth of multiplex imaging because the read out is only one you know people rely on FRET or fluorescence and we might need to use like multiple probes to track different protein or even for protein at different organelles right? And then so can we do that actually like people doing flow cytometry to study just cell surface marker people can put 12 different biomarkers detecting 12 different fluorescence channels right? Is the current probe design available now to like a toolkit allow us to simultaneously track more than a dozen interesting points there.",
