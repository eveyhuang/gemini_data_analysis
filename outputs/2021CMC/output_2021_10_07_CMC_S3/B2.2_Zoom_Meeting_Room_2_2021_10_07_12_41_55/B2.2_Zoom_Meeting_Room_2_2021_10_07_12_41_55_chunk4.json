            "transcript": "If I could just ask so and also echo what people have been saying. We've been talking about kind of spatial resolution, resolving the substrate, and now I think we're talking about dynamics. So I think which of those or and there's probably more aspects of enzyme activity you're most interested in would determine the probe, kind of going back to what Gabriella was saying, there are trade-offs, there are some fundamental physics limitations. But do you care more about dynamics and time resolution or do you care more about spatial resolution or specificity would determine maybe the kind of tool you'd want to use.",

So you don't need that much more that standard resolution is plenty but it may not be the case for more complex question or question of how signal propagate within a cell, right?",

It's been sort of interesting on a theoretical point of view we see similar principle of waves as a mechanism to propagate signals but there is almost a four order of magnitude in the speed of the waves we have in fly embryos versus zebrafish adults which in itself it's interesting how they can control all those time scales.",

Usually in most proposal or papers, spatial temporal has been combined as even a single word. So I just want to chime in regarding Neil's question. Then you ask about enzyme turnover. So it's also related to where inside the cell, which specific organelle and in certain space. And then you have to a certain detection or the tool will have to differentiate that enzyme's fluorescence level like substrate fluorescence level from the other counterpart or the rest of the cells. Because probes could be everywhere but although nowadays there's a trend to develop organelle specific probe, organelle targeted probes too.",

I was like oh wow that expresses what I've been feeling in the proteomics community. It's just like I have 30,000 phosphorylation sites. Good for you. Which ones are functional versus bystander?",
