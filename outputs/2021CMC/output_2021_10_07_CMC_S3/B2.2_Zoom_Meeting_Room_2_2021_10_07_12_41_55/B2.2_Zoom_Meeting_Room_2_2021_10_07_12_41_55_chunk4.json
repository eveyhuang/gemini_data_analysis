So I think which of those or and there's probably more aspects of enzyme activity you're most interested in would determine the probe, kind of going back to what Gabriela was saying there are trade-offs, there are some fundamental physics limitations. But you know do you care more about dynamics and time resolution or do you care more about spatial resolution or specificity would determine maybe the kind of tool you'd want to use.",

Usually in most proposal or papers, spatial-temporal has been combined as even a single word. So I just want to chime in regarding Neil's question. Then you ask about enzyme turnover. So it's also related to where inside the cell, which specific organelle and in certain space. And then you have to a certain detection or the tool will have to differentiate that enzyme's fluorescence level like substrate fluorescence level from the other counterparts or the rest of the cells. Because probes could be everywhere but although nowadays there's a trend to develop organelle-specific probe, organelle-targeted probes too. Yeah.",

So can we model this or can we actually be helped by together with experiments to see what interacts with what and see what are the driving forces for that. It's uh might be a little bit simpler than GPCRs might be not because it's a single trans membrane uh single pass trans single trans membrane helix but you know it's uh quite complex still it seems.",
