And we have this amazing technology now of nanobodies and nanobody libraries that can be displayed on yeast and and then also this technology of taking two different binding sites and putting them together so that you could have heterozygous binding sites as opposed to the classic antibody that has exactly the same antigen for both things and that would bring proteins together. So I'm wondering if anybody's thought about using nanobodies and screening for creating molecules that bind to your favorite chemical or would be called a hapten as opposed to an antigen.",

So there's also like there are some of these sensor, one of the nice thing of the FRET sensor and some of these that were mentioned before is that at least in first approximation are inert. So you could put it in there and your cell is still going to do what it's supposed to do. So that's another frontier I guess, making sure that they work and they work without messing up the cell I guess.",
