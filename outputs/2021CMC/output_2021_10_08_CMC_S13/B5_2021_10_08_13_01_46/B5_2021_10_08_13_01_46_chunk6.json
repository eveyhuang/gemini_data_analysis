So are we talking about, you know, needing to do single molecule or single, sorry, single cell studies where, you know, we're looking at, you know, one cell and a series of changes that are occurring through that cell versus a population of cells and then you have to start thinking about, you know, what is the cell-cell variability, right? Because you can't necessarily say especially when we start thinking about things like amplitude of signal um and resulting effects that all cells are going to behave similarly, right? And so, you know, what what is the context within which we're going to be looking at these signaling events?",

I mean that's the good thing. Yeah, but there's there's 3D organoids, you know people are trying to build up to, you know, lab on a chip, organism on a chip, actual animals, right? There's all these levels. Um okay, so we have uh maybe five or maybe 10 more minutes to do our discussion and then we've got to uh help Abhishek put together our slide. Uh so do we have any more uh so we've talked pretty big picture here. Do we have any more uh signaling pathways that uh we really want to say is an important thing to study um as a group? Um or are we want to be more general about the context, the players, the architecture, the integration of signals, the amplification of signals. It's up to you guys. Yeah.",

Um mechanics are important for gene expression and and I think it's it's been established in breast cancer cells, for example, if they migrate through certain tissue and it it depends on how soft or how stiff the tissue is that activates different expression programs which then lead to proliferation of the cells or not. Um so so that is is really a thing. I don't exactly how it happens. I mean there there I mean there must be some some cascade coming through the cytoskeleton probably to the nucleus. Um maybe it's just a volume change that makes different things accessible or or leads to different mechanisms like say condensate formation affected by density or or pressure in that sense, um which then activates different parts. Um so so that's certainly a thinkable cascade.",

I mean, and there started to be a little bit of work where people understand that the glycocalyx affects the mechanics of the membranes as well and the diffusion, the mobility, the the lipid rafts, everything. Uh but it's normally ignored. Um so it's very true. And in the context of shape, I mean, I think uh one really outstanding question is not just the single cell shape but the collective, right, like the tissue shape, right? So how does the cell knows its own shape but more so how does the collective uh understand when there are changes individually in cells like in cancer but many other diseases as well, right? And how that translate at the end to a collective um uh reaction or emergent behavior. Uh so there's a lot there's a lot unknown unknowns I'm sure as well there.",
