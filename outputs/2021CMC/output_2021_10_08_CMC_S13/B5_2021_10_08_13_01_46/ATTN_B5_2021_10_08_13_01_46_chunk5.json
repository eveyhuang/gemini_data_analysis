      "transcript": "transcriptomics like are those like sufficient right if you if you can poke a signaling process at least I'm talking about the level of of of cellular phenomena you can poke a signaling process and sort of map the before and after state using each of these omics methods is that enough information to I guess like define all the things we said you need to be defined like what are the players what's the maybe not the architecture but the players.",

I'm you know I'm not sure how well the integration of next generation sequencing plus you know proteomics plus metabolomics goes but but I also think you know definitely because when we're talking about signaling we're also talking about you know time scales and amplitudes of perturbation and things like that and and you know all those methods at least to the best of my ability kind of or the best of my knowledge I should say kind of fall short in that realm.",

I think those would be that would be a focused like at least we'll be able to conceive a few things like what would be like the you know yeah what are the signals that we are extremely extremely interested in and and like what.",
