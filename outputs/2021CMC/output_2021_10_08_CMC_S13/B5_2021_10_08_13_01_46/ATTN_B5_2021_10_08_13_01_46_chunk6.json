And then it's, you know, it's kind of a linear chain of thought but as we've just been talking about, right, that might actually not be linear at all. It might be multiple cascades of stuff with feedback loops and then it looks linear, but it really might not be.",

The deletion itself, right, might get other parts in close proximity to turn on and off transcription that you didn't even think about, right? Like the deletion itself, the way you alter would also most likely affect whatever is going on in the cell. So that that itself can be very very damaging and and and get the cell into a different path.",

So are we talking about, you know, needing to do single molecule or single, sorry, single cell studies where, you know, we're looking at, you know, one cell and a series of changes that are occurring through that cell versus a population of cells and then you have to start thinking about, you know, what is the cell-cell variability, right? Because you can't necessarily say especially when we start thinking about things like amplitude of signal and resulting effects that all cells are going to behave similarly, right? And so, you know, what what is the context within which we're going to be looking at these signaling events?",

I mean that's the good thing. Yeah, but there's there's 3D organoids, you know people are trying to build up to, you know, lab on a chip, organ on a chip, actual animals, right? There's all these levels. Um, okay, so we have maybe five or maybe 10 more minutes to do our discussion and then we've got to help Abhishek put together our slide. So do we have any more so we've talked pretty big picture here. Do we have any more signaling pathways that we really want to say is an important thing to study as a group or are we want to be more general about the context, the players, the architecture, the integration of signals, the amplification of signals. It's up to you guys. Yeah.",

So I I don't know, I don't know what the best like, you know, picking a top five is I think really hard.",
