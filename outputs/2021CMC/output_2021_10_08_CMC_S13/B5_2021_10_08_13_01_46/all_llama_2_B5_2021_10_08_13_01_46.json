And what I think works well is if we save like the last 15 minutes to get that thing done collectively. So so then we'll have about just under an hour to talk about this topic. Okay. So so I'm Cathy Murphy. I'm at the University of Illinois. I'm a chemist. I'm a nanoparticle person and we do work with cells in kind of, but not at all in the ways that this whole Scialog is about. But I'm interested in signaling at different scales because I do like to know what makes cells do things and of course in in my world we want to have nanoparticles like intervene with things, you know, which is always a lot of fun. So I'm going to go around and call people that I see in order on my screen and then so again, just say your name, where you're from. At this point we might know almost everybody.

A good example of that is like immune cell activation like T cell activation works that way for example.

        "transcript": "That's exactly like in in information theory that's a very clear way of defining what a signal is. Your players are your constraints and your function is actually the entropy function rho log rho. When you maximize your uncertainty under the knowledge of these players the constraints of these players and then whatever comes out of that is essentially the signal. Might be a canonical distribution function if your players are position if NVT is are the players this is the only things that you know then the signal is this Gaussian distribution function. And so I think that's a very clear so and then essentially and that's where I think the the the field definition comes in every field brings in its own constraints and therefore what you call signal depends entirely upon what you're calling constraints. It's a signal under the prejudice of certain constraints and knowledge that you are are are putting into your into your thought process. So so yeah like uh again like in energy signaling that we often look into it's very difficult to see energy the way we classically define it moving through a cell it will have to so what can be monitored is some manifestations of energy transfer which can happen by changing concentration by monitoring things like the concentration of reactive species that tells you or or energy rich metabolites this is where the energy is moving through. So so again like we have essentially constrained our our information by by our knowledge of these these specific species that we can measure and then then whatever arises after that is a signal like basically. So so yeah I will now stop now.",

They have depolarization events and a pre versus post synaptic neuron communicates that message electrochemically basically right. So depolarization here causes depolarization here but they're they're not physically touching right so unlike a circuit there's no way for that electrical information to be transduced and so it's gated by chemistry right that that is exocytosed here and then affects receptors on the post synaptic neuron to then you know relay that signal downstream and it's it's interesting because I think this is where that concept of tools comes in as well. Being able to measure action potentials is something we've been able to do for at least about a decade or so and we've used that almost as a proxy for their chemical signaling but as new tools become available to look at the chemistry it's becoming apparent that for every action potential there could be as little as a 5 10% probability of actual neurochemical release. So it it touches on a lot of themes I think that that we've been discussing here about how more sensitive tools spatially and temporally are allowing to see kind of these new dimensions of information. The other kind of way that we classically at least in neuroscience probe how it is that that these signals are transduced is with pharmacology right so we add drugs to the brain we know that they agonize or antagonize receptors and so we make conclusions about what that agonist or antagonist action does and and where the role of those receptors are in the pre versus post synaptic neurons and but it's still I think that's still a very hazy method of of understanding signaling in an organ that that arguably is the main signaling pathway of the entire body.",

You still get regulation but if you look at an individual cell it may look completely different from from what your population looks like right and and that's that's maybe what you what what Markita describes about action potentials you know so some 5 to 10% of the time it works but most of the time it doesn't.

You switch the condition this object is supposed to be robust to a range of conditions. Then something that was irrelevant in the previous condition the redundancy now becomes important. So so definitely within the cell that has been shown many a times. Out like at an intercellular level I will not be able to comment but I haven't because I don't know too much about it. But definitely within the cell one of the reasons the redundancies are created so that it can be robust. And like essentially something that material systems try to achieve. They are engineered systems are very very efficient not as robust possibly. And that's what natural systems are basically more adaptable. And this adaptability comes in from the robustness from the possibility of having multiple signaling pathways with different weights and the weights of these pathways switch depending upon what environment you are in.

I mean actually I thought that was very interesting because to me crosstalk I always thought of crosstalk as like a loss. Like you cared about this one pathway and anything that went to some other pathway was then be a loss for your pathway but if it actually helps amplify it then you know then that's actually again means we need to zoom out a little more when we're doing these studies perhaps right.",

So it's like a a like in a very clear case of a chemical signal called ROS its origin is starting from a chemical reaction at picoseconds and then its biological relevance stays up to seconds beyond which even if it stays in the cell no one cares the cell has a way of figuring its way out.

So we we've been thinking about and that's with some colleagues who have different expertise about how can you map out in time the cascades through which these cells go and which ones of them actually make it to the final state and then can we back propagate and and measure this kind of architecture of of that pathway in that sense I mean is it signaling I don't know but but so the one big thing there is we don't know the players we don't know what's going to change but at the same time it's also difficult to follow individual cells through that process. So so the idea that we have been putting forward it did not get funded but was to to put some sort of barcodes in the starting population so these barcodes get amplified so we can track daughter cells through the entire process and then find the barcodes that make it into the final sample and then backtrack and at every single time do these fishing experiments and see what is the population the distributions of states that we have at different time points and can we just construct the flow through this network of of states.",

Um so so that is is really a thing. I don't exactly how it happens. I mean there there I mean there must be some some cascade coming through the cytoskeleton probably to the nucleus. Um maybe it's just a volume change that makes different things accessible or or leads to different mechanisms like say condensate formation affected by density or or pressure in that sense, um which then activates different parts.

Of course computationally it's difficult to model across scales that is true and should acknowledge that. It does it does and like it's it's good like actually like between Rommie and me even at the cost of sounding impolite I can say some things have been happening which was but this very very you know you need certain kind of computers and things like that to do this but like you know there are a number of work that has come up that can even connect phenotypic outcomes to molecular inputs. So so those but very very specific in very specific ways. So but yeah like you know big papers have come out that that that have been able to show things but you can't just literally scale it across all groups today it's not not not so straightforward. It takes years essentially like to do this kind of things but but yeah like writing review papers and things like that to summarize as much as it can be summarized.
