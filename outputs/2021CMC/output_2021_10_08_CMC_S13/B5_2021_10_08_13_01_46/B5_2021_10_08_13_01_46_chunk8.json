What else needs to be of course we could not find our top five signaling pathways which is great and might we should say that that that kind of shows the diversity that exists in this essentially that it's not so straightforward. Of course computationally it's difficult to model across scales that is true and should acknowledge that. It does it does and like it's it's good like actually like between Rommie and me even at the cost of sounding impolite I can say some things have been happening which was but this very very you know you need certain kind of computers and things like that to do this but like you know there are a number of work that has come up that can even connect phenotypic outcomes to molecular inputs. So so those but very very specific in very specific ways. So but yeah like you know big papers have come out that that that have been able to show things but you can't just literally scale it across all groups today it's not not not so straightforward. It takes years essentially like to do this kind of things but but yeah like writing review papers and things like that to summarize as much as it can be summarized. But yeah like it's one big problem for computations is a lot of these signals die beyond a certain scales and so computations can't pick it up so simply. Okay we have 53 seconds anything else",
