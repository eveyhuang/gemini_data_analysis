So that's on the one hand but then if you yeah to do the spatial resolution I think you were really also limited I think in terms of like what the techniques are so with with MALDI ionization then it's really about like how large the laser size is to kind of ionize different regions or I think there's some some interesting sort of nano ESI based techniques on surfaces where you can kind of digest little droplets on on tissue preparations for example but again still I think in the micron range so like nowhere near single cell resolution or subcellular resolution.",

So so maybe like we can break it down into like you know if we want to come up with some like single molecule or single cell proteomics maybe it's okay that we lose the spatial resolution because we don't we don't really have that with these other technologies that we're trying to like strive for in terms of the the sequencing.",

So maybe like you know instead of trying to define the entire proteome you want to know what kind of proteome actually has a spatial component to it like if you can work on a larger model system or a larger cell or whatever to like better focus how you then re-miniaturize.",

So with that I think you can sequence or screen them on a chip or you can you know screen them at a large scale because that's going to be coupled by next-gen sequencing just the same way as RNA seek and other things. I think I don't know how this can be scaled up and then applied to many different areas but definitely something that can couple with NGS.",
