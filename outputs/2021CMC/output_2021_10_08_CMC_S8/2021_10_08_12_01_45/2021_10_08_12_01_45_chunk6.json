No we don't want genetic variation in the population. We we want 27 people we want a reference and the field of proteomics doesn't necessarily advertise its limitations first or seek to get composition of matter and and set a firm foundation. It's a and so that yeah and then you you you just have there's so many dimensions to the proteome and and that's why it's so connected to our biology but it um so where yeah where do we if we if we pivot to think about a a report out you know did we did we do our job here and what do we think",
