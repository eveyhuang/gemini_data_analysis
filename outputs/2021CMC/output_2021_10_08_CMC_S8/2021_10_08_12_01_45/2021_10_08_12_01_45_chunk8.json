So there's classical chemistry definition of non-steady state and non-equilibrium. Um but when you look at cells um these um non-steady state and non-equilibrium states they happen when cell state changes in many different ways from metabolisms, structure, aging, mutation, when compartmentalization changes. And the issue is also that it happened in many different scales. Um what we think is that in the future um we would need more better definition of what is non-steady state and non-equilibrium in biology and ways to quantitatively define um those concepts. The second topic we talk about is when does the assumption when is the assumption valid or convenient for our study. And because a lot of time we do apply equilibrium and steady state assumption um to look at cells. Um some of these examples include you know in in molecular dynamic simulation or in the non-linear dynamics of cells like bistability, oscillation. Um but when there's a lot of cases when the assumption is problematic as well. For instance um when metabolism or pH suddenly change and that can change the viscoelasticity of cytoplasm and that can change the the steady state of cells. Um other examples include for example diffusion of molecule in cells it does not necessarily increase with temperature as predicted by um basic um diffusion law.",
