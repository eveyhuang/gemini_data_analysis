It just in terms of the selectivity and binding affinity, most aptamers will need a longer time to be optimized. It's not so comparable to the antibody. And even when we talk about antibody, we're very worried about the specificity and selectivity when we use antibody to enrich proteins for proteomics. So.",

So maybe if we can't amplify the signal, can we just amplify how we take the measurement? Does that make sense?",

You know, so like companies like Quantum-Si or Nautilus or you know, there's been a lot of investment or at least promised investment to to not to to go single molecule because we can't amplify, we have no PCR, so we just have to get more sensitive. Or like what Ion Torrent did or Jonathan Rothberg is in this game with a company called Quantum-Si. But these, you know, these are very high-risk approaches. Um, but it's the same yeah, Laura, your yeah, we're we go decade every decade and we still can't amplify proteins and and and by the way, proteins that's a myth, right? They're actually proteoforms. And you say, well what's a proteoform? Well, think about all these technologies are going to run smack into the variation of proteins. When you guys talked about what you did, like Ross, you know, post-translational modifications, we we don't we don't have a reference atlas for what proteoforms exist. All these technologies, they might be able to sequence right now a few amino acids using using single molecule approaches, but they're when they hit PTMs, they're going to it's going to delay them by a decade or you know. So, so I don't know if we do it with ion amplification or we go single molecule, um, and then you run into what Alexis said about spatial, how do you, you know, even RNA-seq is having a hard time putting in spatial register their information. So those are three major challenges and I'll stop because I'm now rambling.",

            "transcript": "I just have a very naive question. Can we do or maybe it's already existing in the field, can we do something like a split-pool research platform? You first isolate, use the Drop-seq kind of thing to separate them into single cells, you barcode those cells, then if resolution is an issue, we will pool the similar cells in the similar cluster at a spatial level and then mass spec them. So although that probably not at a single cell resolution, but there are at least similar functional populations or spatial clusters.",

Um and that's an approach. Or like what you said, do sampling or flow cytometry or to try to get each single cell and then read out its proteome, its proteome which would be a million proteoforms or more. So there's a family of approaches there but but I think what people are trying to do is get the detector right, whether it be mass spec like what Laura said or or single molecule protein sequencing. And then your your Drop-seq approach or you know, there's a various families of ways to try to get the sample.",

We're focused on sort of proteomics by mass spectrometry which of course we all like and love and definitely also a strong advocate. But there are other I don't know, optical techniques or electrochemical techniques for for detection of analytes, right? And I had some conversations yesterday with one participant using like a really a really sensitive sort of optical technique for single molecule detection. I think this was Judith Su, I think Laura you've worked with her before, right? And so I had no idea about this. This is sort of like very very exciting. So should we think outside of mass spec?",

So the question is, you know, do you want to design experiments to look for something like a specific proteoform or are you attempting to capture all of it? So I think that's where the goes into what is the research question because I think there are better techniques other than mass spectrometry that are going to give you that spatial information, but you already had to kind of know what you were trying to look for. So the question is, yeah, do you want to untarget the world or like laser focus zoom in?",

But if it's like, I want to know what, you know, the sequences of everything in the cell are, then you have to go to like either bulk sequencing or single cell sequencing and you lose the spatial resolution. And so here, we could, you know, the antibody-based imaging approaches for looking at proteins, we can retain some of that spatial information, but we have to generate an antibody for each thing that we're looking for.",

They can functionalize the probe with some certain functional group that can direct to mitochondria, can direct to membrane or inner membrane. So, yeah. And certain probes can be combined with mass spec, this is called chemical proteomics, and to allow for the enrichment of the protein certainly from that subcellular or space.",
