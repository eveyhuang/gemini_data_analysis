It just in terms of the like selectivity and uh binding affinity uh most aptamers will need a longer time to be optimized. Uh it's not so comparable to the antibody. Um and then even when we talk about antibody we're like very worried about the specificity and selectivity when we use antibody to enrich proteins for proteomics. So.",

So like this is like kind of hot right now in metabolomics to use like a MALDI matrix that covalently binds a certain functional group and then you inherently increase the ionization efficiency by like adding an inherent charge. So like maybe if we can't amplify the signal can we just like amplify how we take the measurement. Does that make sense?",

You know so like companies like Quantum Si or Nautilus or you know there's been a lot of investment or at least promised investment to to not to to go single molecule because we can't amplify we have no PCR so we just have to get more sensitive or like what Ion Torrent did or Jonathan Rothberg is in this game with a company called Quantum Si. But these you know these are very high risk approaches um but it's the same yeah Laura your yeah we're we go decade every decade and we still can't amplify proteins and and and by the way proteins that's a myth right they're actually proteoforms. And you say well what's a proteoform well think about all these technologies are going to run smack into the variation of proteins. When you guys talked about what you did like Ross post translational modifications we we don't we don't have a reference atlas for what proteoforms exist. All these technologies they might be able to sequence right now a few amino acids using using single molecule approaches but they're when they hit PTMs they're going to it's going to delay them by a decade or you know so so I don't know if we do it with ion amplification or we go single molecule and then you run into what Alexis said about spatial how do you you know even RNA seek is having a hard time putting in spatial register their information. So those are three major challenges and I'll stop because I'm now rambling.",

Can we do something like a split pool uh research platform you first isolate use the drop seek kind of thing uh to separate them into single cells you barcode those cells then if resolution is an issue we will pull the similar cells in the similar cluster at a special level and then mass spec them. So although that probably not at a single cell resolution but there are at least similar functional populations or special clusters.",

So there's a family of approaches there but but I think what people are trying to do is get the detector right whether it be mass spec like what Laura said or or single molecule protein sequencing. And then your your drop seek approach or you know there's a various families of ways to try to get the sample.",

I think um this was Judith Su I think Laura you've you've worked with her um before right and so I I like no idea about this this is sort of like very very exciting.

So the question is you know do you want to design experiments to look for something like a specific proteoform or are you attempting to capture all of it. So like I think that's where like the goes into what is the research question because I think with there are better techniques other than mass spectrometry that are going to give you that spatial information but you already had to kind of know what you were trying to look for.
