            "transcript": "have a two years before the COVID started. So my lab, the main techniques we are using is we are interested in the function of RNA modifications. The main techniques we are using is CRISPR screening to identify the key enzymes which may regulate the important RNA modifications in certain cellular processes. And we use liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spec to quantify the levels of RNA modifications. And we do high-throughput sequencing to pinpoint where are those modifications in human genome. And during COVID, got more and more interested in phase separation, this topic. That's why we started to do proximity labeling mass spec to determine the protein and RNA constituents in the phase separated compartments.",

            "transcript": "Okay. Hi everyone. My name is Lars Plate. I'm in the chemistry and biological sciences department at Vanderbilt University and we're a chemical biology group looking at coordination of protein-protein interactions. So we're really interested in how protein interactions play a role in protein folding, biogenesis, and protein trafficking. And so applications are protein misfolding diseases, so how those are caused by dysregulation of these processes. And then the other aspect is viral infections, so how do viruses take advantage of the protein homeostasis network in the infected cells and kind of use that to to help fold and assemble the virus particles. And so then we use a lot of mass spectrometry as our main main sort of technique of interest to study these protein complexes, so affinity purification mass spec. So this this topic really is kind of very close to home. And and really excited because one of the aspects I think that's really kind of challenging for us is sort of we think a lot about sort of temporal resolution, what is the sequence of protein interaction events as proteins get folded and trafficked. But then there's of course also the spatial aspect to this, right? These proteins traverse the secretory pathway or they get get localized to different parts of the cells and how how can we develop techniques that can can capture this efficiently.",

            "transcript": "Okay, great. Well, okay, so this is my swan song, I guess, or my last facilitation. And I have this sort of two-step thing in my head when I I was responsible for, well, me and Romy, creating this this thing. But so, to Tanya's question about protein biochemistry and proteomics, why is it still a problem, the compositional proteome? The composition of matter still has not been defined. So that that's a foundational statement that we haven't sequenced the human proteome. And that's one of my passions and so I won't hide that, I'll just lay it out. But the supposition is that that if we could do that in in, do it with 100% coverage, you know, it may shock you to know that proteomics, compositional proteomics is a, you know, 0.1x coverage science, whereas genomics is a 50x coverage. So that, you know, when you when you look at the modern state of play, that's one of the reasons, Tanya, we don't have this locked down, not even close. And so that's like a first step, but then the supposition is if you do that well, then you can take the second step and you could then invigorate single molecule protein sequencing, single cell proteomics, and and in space, do what we did for what we do single cell RNA-seq now with a depth of about 3 to 4,000 transcripts per cell if you're if you do it, you know, well and you're successful. Single cell proteomics right now, compositionally is about 1,000, 1,500 proteins per cell, but they're little peptides, they're not the full proteoforms. So that's the sort of thing that that I was imagining to to get both compositional and spatial proteomics on the rails. And but that, I now I've just layered way too much of my own personal bias on these three questions. But at least to tee us up, maybe the first point, do we need to sequence the proteome in compositional proteomics, just that first point. What are your what are your thoughts or biases or you just tell me to be quiet.",

            "transcript": "Just sort of a question or comments, you know, along that line. I really think from my perspective that this this spatial aspect of proteomics is very important, especially, you know, like in my perspective, when you come to a translational, you know, applications like apply to, you know, the clinic, medical, drug target discovery, all of that. When we were talking about, you know, kind of these medical tissues like tumors, you want to study the tumor microenvironment, all of that in vivo stuff. Without really spatial resolution, of course, imaging is important here for sure, we cannot really know exactly what's going on compared to just basic proteomics sequencing based. A lot of these models were really done in cell lines, which is great. You know, that provides the first draft of information we can, you know, narrow down, get a prioritized list. But I think this is really getting a step closer to the, to the real kind of application that we want to do eventually.",

And so, I have no idea. And so, you know, for example, if you have two cells that, you know, they're right next to each other, can you figure out what each cell is doing or do you just get the average? And so, ideally not you, Neil, but one of the other people could explain at least this to me as a real novice, that would be helpful to me. And then maybe we can go on.",

            "transcript": "So I think for mass spectrometry, and this maybe I'll also just interject too, you know, I think it's really good because it's label-free, it can be label-free. It gives you a wide range, like of exact, you know, you can get structure based on exact masses and tandem data. So if you don't know what you're looking for, you can usually get a pretty good idea. It's inherently limited because we have to generate ions, so that's kind of an inefficient process. And not everything ionizes in the cell, although proteins, pieces of proteins should. And I think for spatial spatial imaging mass spectrometry, especially when it comes to proteins, there's an inherent limit on it's copy number. So like, you know, are you ever going to see one protein if that's all the cell makes of it? Like is that enough to get that one thing ionized? I don't think so. So for the imaging mass spectrometry with proteomics, it's been limited to high copy number small proteins. So the things that the cell abundantly makes. And unless the cell is very large, it's not been a high spatial resolution. So like the modern instruments, the best you can kind of get is a five micron image. And I think you kind of need that bigger area because again, it's copy number. So how many copy numbers in a cell do you expect?",
