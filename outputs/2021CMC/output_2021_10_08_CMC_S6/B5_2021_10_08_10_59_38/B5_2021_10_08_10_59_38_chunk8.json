I also heard some people saying that there was room for modeling for for whether it's a whole cell or a whole organism or and and then using those models from which to extract new insight and and that that it's not like at the exclusion of the other.",

That's awesome space to live in. And there's some people who live in only theory space some who live in both and some who then do experiments maybe Shankar is in all three spaces I don't know.",
