So to some extent I think it kind of relates to Sandy's question maybe a little remotely but it's you know I think where it works well I always think about the the alpha fold structures and all that stuff. The problem is super well defined and super well annotated super well characterized it's very clear what the output needs to be and what what the inputs are and so it it works really well it worked relatively well so far because it's very well defined I think and the question is very clear. So I think they started really with the question here. And I've seen other machine learning in completely different fields I mean it could be in you know image reconstruction or there's someone in the in the lab where I am who's looking at some machine learning that people developed to pick up FRET data you know single particle FRET data and absolutely fails miserably on that because probably the it's not so well defined what are the conditions that the the training data sets were taken on and and so even the the authors cannot really answer these these guys uh you know the students question because it's they don't know what's going on and it's from my point of view it's because the the the data are not well defined and and and even though the question was well well defined here.",

Um we we've started a collaboration like that recently and it's been fantastic. I mean I don't I wouldn't say that we've had any big wins yet but you know everything's like each lab's directions are being formed by you know the baby steps from from each group and I think it's really helping improve the algorithms the experiments back and forth um to a point where we can figure out what's the what are the constraints of the machine learning method and how it might um be fed by the right type of data and things like that.",
