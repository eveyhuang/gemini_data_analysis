Rigoberto, what do you think about the possibility, I'm seeking your advice here, about the possibility to go around, have everybody sort of give their top thoughts about the topic generally, so everybody sort of says something and then we can go in and do a deeper dive maybe where we hear that there's synergy from folks.",

One thing that could help with that is since everyone is on the notes field, if you wrote down a sentence or a phrase or a catchall for what's going to be the thing you're going to point out, maybe just write that down also or and that will make it easier for us to to write down. Sometimes we ask people to write a sentence in in the real meeting, but I think it can be a little bit looser than that but having a catchall for that would be helpful so we can start to sort it.",

And it's interesting, my my background being in physics and then kind of moved moving more recently to biology, kind of some of the standards in biology, especially when using living animals, standards for biological replicates, transparency in and kind of rigor of using and and kind of describing error and making data open source that I think are great and perhaps not as strictly enforced in in other fields that that don't work with living systems. So I'm curious about, yeah, kind of like machine learning approaches in in what fields would be, in what fields they would be most useful and perhaps it's the fields in which there is more data to access, in which that data is kind of clearly presented as multiple replicates and and in which the annotation and the way that the data is archived is kind of clearly made such that it could be consolidated for for machine learning. It's not an area that I do much active research in but it's certainly something that I've thought about when when trying to pull machine learning into some of the work that we do.",

            "transcript": "So I'm not an expert in machine learning at all. We just worked recently with a group in the statistics department to develop some machine learning model for a hydrogen bond system that we're interested in. So definitely I I think the promise of machine learning is that we can do way more things than we can do previously. So and then the issue there I I find is the data definitely. And then how we provide the data, how accurate are the data, and how we train the model. It's really, I mean the limitation of machine learning is really how you teach it. It will it will come out as the model that you want, which is a little bit annoying because if the data itself was only limited in one region of the phase space for example, the prediction would be more accurate in that phase space instead of you know the overall, you know, the the real prediction power. So that's what I find. And I think it's it's really a joint force between theory and experiments to generate these good data. We like in our model we're relying on the protein data bank and we're trying to get the the top like 1% highest quality structures over there, but then these are just experimental data. If there are high accuracy computational data, I think these would definitely be more useful. And we also find that if we give them data in this region of the the space we're interested in, you know, the model give us something really weird. But then just recently my student had some like he had over a thousand data in the original space and then he generated like 10 in a in a new direction, although we don't know which direction it is, it completely changed the machine learning model and its prediction. So that I think is a pitfall because as a user of machine learning model, we usually don't care about these stuff. And then people really need to be careful about how they treat data, how they get the training data and whether they have kind of sampled the entire, I don't know how you call it, a space that for the prediction.",

So the so data is a big issue in my you know my specific area of of research and and a lot of the atomic level enzyme reaction modeling, there's not really a lot of reproducibility in terms of like the multi-scale like the QM/MM enzyme modeling and there's no kind of best practices for how to for to how to report and and collect structural information with molecular dynamics that could be gigabytes or terabytes of of information. And so is there a way to compress that? Is there a way to make standards in how you report atomic level modeling so that that information can be extracted by machine learning methods?
