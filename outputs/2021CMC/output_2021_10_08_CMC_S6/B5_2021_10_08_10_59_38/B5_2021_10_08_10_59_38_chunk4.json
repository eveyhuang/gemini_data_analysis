One one question that I have for the whole group is that in our in our slide we have this bolded overarching question. Does anybody think that the answer to is there still room for physical based and knowledge based methods and models in modern chemical biology? Does anybody here think that the answer to that is no?",

            "transcript": "Let me frame it since it was kind of my question. Everybody's all so hot about data science and machine learning and even already the questions you've been all framing is is very much like what we were talking about in the first session on how machine learning can accelerate discovery. The question is is that is are we so far into data science and machine learning and we believe that it's going to solve everything that we no longer should be using sort of bottom up physics based models like all MD and or should we is there room for developing theories that are sort of would be like in the middle scales that would again be a different types of equations of motion that or a different types of of descriptors that would then be modeled with course graining say or is is a one tool that people might say or knowledge based methods or is it really just all data science now and it's going to be learning from the data and we don't need to do anything predictive. So so I was sort of trying to to suggest that maybe there's a reason for advancing in in combinations. I was hoping that the answer was yes that there is still room but I but even just in the way that the conversation started everyone immediately went to just data science and machine learning as the answer. Nothing wrong with that that's",

So so reference data there's still a lot there's I still think that there's my lifetime at least worth of you know of collecting better data and and finding vehicles to share data better. I mean you you can't I don't know I'm not a data scientist but I don't think that you can have you can be a data scientist without an act of enough data if you don't have enough data right.",
