And we will have time at the end, we'll be sure to set aside time after we have our fantastic discussion. We'll set aside time to sort of review what we talked about to help the reporter report back out in sort of a comprehensive way, is what I would say. I mean, at least I've found that helpful for for for the sessions. So, I'm going to shame, I'm going to shamelessly take Rigoberto's new trick, which I just learned yesterday for assigning a scribe and a reporter instead of asking for volunteers. We're just going to sort of randomly assign it. So I'm going to use this really cool timer trick where we start the clock and then at the end, the last two digits are going to give us a number and whoever's closest to that number will be the scribe, and then we'll do it again and that person will be the reporter. And so if you could please into the chat, which we have up and going already, which is a nice feature. Hopefully you guys are all accustomed to using that with Zoom. If you could please each enter a number from one to, between I guess zero and 99. And then whoever's closest to that will just go through. So enter that in there. I need to count. ",

And it's interesting, my my background being in physics and then kind of moved moving more recently to biology, kind of some of the standards in biology, especially when using living animals, standards for biological replicates, transparency in and kind of rigor of using and and kind of describing error and making data open source that I think are great and perhaps not as strictly enforced in in other fields that that don't work with living systems. So I'm curious about, yeah, kind of like machine learning approaches in in what fields would be, in what fields they would be most useful and perhaps it's the fields in which there is more data to access, in which that data is kind of clearly presented as multiple replicates and and in which the annotation and the way that the data is archived is kind of clearly made such that it could be consolidated for for machine learning.

We just worked recently with a group in the statistics department to develop some machine learning model for a hydrogen bond system that we're interested in. So definitely I I think the promise of machine learning is that we can do way more things than we can do previously. So and then the issue there I I find is the data definitely. And then how we provide the data, how accurate are the data, and how we train the model. It's really, I mean the limitation of machine learning is really how you teach it. It will it will come out as the model that you want, which is a little bit annoying because if the data itself was only limited in one region of the phase space for example, the prediction would be more accurate in that phase space instead of you know the overall, you know, the the real prediction power. So that's what I find. And I think it's it's really a joint force between theory and experiments to generate these good data. We like in our model we're relying on the protein data bank and we're trying to get the the top like 1% highest quality structures over there, but then these are just experimental data. If there are high accuracy computational data, I think these would definitely be more useful. And we also find that if we give them data in this region of the the space we're interested in, you know, the model give us something really weird. But then just recently my student had some like he had over a thousand data in the original space and then he generated like 10 in a in a new direction, although we don't know which direction it is, it completely changed the machine learning model and its prediction. So that I think is a pitfall because as a user of machine learning model, we usually don't care about these stuff. And then people really need to be careful about how they treat data, how they get the training data and whether they have kind of sampled the entire, I don't know how you call it, a space that for the prediction.

The question is is that is are we so far into data science and machine learning and we believe that it's going to solve everything that we no longer should be using sort of bottom up physics based models like all MD and or should we is there room for developing theories that are sort of would be like in the middle scales that would again be a different types of equations of motion that or a different types of of descriptors that would then be modeled with course graining say or is is a one tool that people might say or knowledge based methods or is it really just all data science now and it's going to be learning from the data and we don't need to do anything predictive. So so I was sort of trying to to suggest that maybe there's a reason for advancing in in combinations. I was hoping that the answer was yes that there is still room but I but even just in the way that the conversation started everyone immediately went to just data science and machine learning as the answer.

Because I feel like with a lot of these I don't even know where to get started.

So how much data do we even need to even begin to apply? Because I think small data sets are very, as people have already said, are very biased and that's probably a problem.

        "utterance": "Elizabeth Read: Yeah I have a lot of thoughts on this but I guess I'll talk a little bit about my perspective on these questions at sort of these larger scales, I think sort of related to maybe what Julien was talking about. So, you know, part of our work is more in the mathematical biology world where a lot of the models are very large scale in the sense of cellular networks, so gene regulatory networks and signaling networks. And in this field a lot of the models are trying to be not necessarily molecularly accurate because everybody acknowledges that we have tons of gaps, but more can we capture the phenomenology? So can we capture the particular sort of circuit dynamics that are going to appropriately describe what's happening with the data and actually be able to predict how this cell would act under a perturbation, let's say, even if we can't actually capture every single pathway and every single interaction in a signaling network for example. And so what I see is that there is this real sort of question of forward or what was it called, inverse versus forward modeling. So the forward model is, alright, we have a whole bunch of different papers that have a whole bunch of cartoons in them with different sort of mechanistic hypotheses about what this pathway is or whatever, let's start building that into a model. We'll have a whole lot of issues with gaps where we don't know the parameters or whatever but we can start to model those things. And maybe if we're lucky we can kind of compete different models like that against each other and see which ones match the data better. And so I guess that would be sort of like a forward modeling problem. But then in this field there's also been a lot of progress in the inverse modeling, I don't know about machine learning but maybe some more sort of old-fashioned statistical inference approaches where people are doing Bayesian inference and kind of model selection against the data. And so I guess that actually sort of combines both, right? Because you still have your models that you start with and then you sort of compete those against the data. But I guess the issue is that you have such a, if you have a lot of gaps in your knowledge of the system and you're still trying to capture some fundamental properties of it, then you have an issue which is that you're never going to be able to put in your space of models all the possibilities. You know, there's this universe of possible, let's say, network structures that might be there that we don't know about yet and you're never going to be able to capture those in all your models. And so then I think there's this issue of this question of bias, like was brought up previously. It's like, well if I start with my best guess of what these systems are doing, I'm going to have tons of gaps or I'm never going to be able to comprehensively model all the possibilities. But on the other hand, if I were to maybe just do a completely data-driven approach and try to have some of these great new algorithms that are somehow going to learn those dynamics from the data, maybe they'll have their own biases, which I'm no expert in that so I don't know what those pitfalls are. But that's what I'm thinking about. ",

It's not to say that this is something that I have expertise in but some association with. I wanted to first briefly touch on questions five and six which are really about what role do atomistic simulations play in understanding of the cell. One question is how big can they get, how big and long can they get, and the other one was should we be modeling things that are cell sized at the atomistic level. As an experimental biochemist who studies protein-protein interactions and cell signaling, I think it would be extraordinary if we could observe at some atomic level resolution the structure and dynamics of large protein complexes or multi-protein complexes operating in the context of a plasma membrane. My sense is that this is very plausible now. I think we're getting very close to that and it seems like the very few limitations that exist from a purely MD standpoint are, the obvious one is computational power, and then with things like the membrane, how well do our force fields and parameters model the membrane. But my naive answer to question F is probably quite big and quite long, we're getting there. But I actually wonder, I'd be curious to know from other people in the room whether you all see a value in being able to model a whole cell or a whole organelle all the way down to the scale and resolution of atoms. It intrigues me intellectually, but is there a value in that? That's a question I wanted to pitch and then I'll have a little comment to make about machine learning, but I'm wondering if anyone wanted to chime in and tell me if they think we should be doing G. I don't know if anyone here in the room is doing that and it's not a criticism of your work, I'm genuinely asking. ",

And I'm I don't know what other examples there might be but I suspect that there are some. And I also was kind of thinking along the lines of what Lu said in that well maybe machine learning could could generate a force field or or some kind of model that would better represent metal binding sites but the current problem is that most of the metal binding sites that we see in the PDB are from crystal structures of well folded proteins and I think the frontier well I I don't I mean maybe I'm biased but I think that there's a frontier on trying to understand the metal binding sites that are present in the non-folded proteins or these intrinsically disordered proteins or so basically when the protein's folding around the metal ion or the metal ion changes the protein structure that data doesn't exist and so we would need the data first to get the machine learning so I think there we need physics based approaches I mean like and maybe knowledge based approaches as well and data lots and lots of data.
