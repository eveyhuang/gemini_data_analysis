            "transcript": "We've got all kinds of people joining us here plus a bot. Okay, groovy. Okay, so we have an hour and 15 minutes to get ourselves organized, so to speak, in this session on phase separation. Okay, so welcome everybody. I'm Cathy Murphy. I know some of you already, but maybe we'll and I guess I'm the only facilitator here. So maybe we can go around real quick. I'll call on people as I see you on my screen and what I'd like us to say is like your name, where you, you know, what department and university you're from, what your general thing is in terms of your science, and then in terms of phase separation, what your interests are in terms of this session. Okay, so I'll make myself a template here. So I'm Cathy Murphy. I'm in chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I'm a nanoparticle person, and so we normally do a lot of synthesis and surface chemistry and some biological applications and some environmental implications. We are interested in some proteins that don't have a structure and like can they form a structure on a nanoparticle surface. So my interests in phase separation in a cell would kind of be along those lines, like, you know, what's the role of proteins in particular that phase segregate in these little droplet things and you know, like what do they do and what are they like and what's their life cycle and stuff like that. So I don't do that stuff myself, but I'm very interested. But that's it's not about me, it's all about you. Okay, so Stephen from Johns Hopkins, you're next on my screen. So can you tell us about yourself and then your interest in separation and then we'll have to also get a organize ourselves in terms of writing and reporting, but let's go around the room first. And you're an expert at that because you already did it yesterday.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, perfect. Well, hi everyone. I'm Stephen Fried. I'm an assistant professor in chemistry and biophysics at Hopkins. I would say our lab is primarily a protein folding biophysics lab, but we make use of a lot of proteomics technologies and basically try to repurpose them so that we can study protein folding sort of more holistically and on more complex systems than the kind of conventional model studies. I would say I got most interested in phase separation when I read Alan Drummond's cell paper from a few years ago that sort of proposed this idea that like these protein coacervates could be functional and not just, you know, sort of a pathological state. But I'm really interested in trying to understand like do cells, you know, purposefully sort of package proteins away to try to protect them or does that carry some sort of proteostatic role and then what allows the cell to then sort of be able to fix a protein, you know, scoop it back out of that collection and resolubilize it again. So I'm really interested in questions like that.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, it's good to see you again. Hello everyone. I'm Lars Plate. I'm an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in chemistry and biological sciences. And like Stephen, I'm also interested in protein folding processes. But we actually look more at protein-protein interactions and the regulation and dynamics of these complexes and proteostasis pathways and how that's regulated in protein misfolding diseases and then also in virus infections, how they viruses basically take advantage of host cell proteostasis processes. But mass spectrometry is a great tool to study protein interactions, so that's also what what we use mostly in the lab and then coupled with some chemical biology tricks and methods development to kind of probe these processes. And so why I'm interested in phase separation is also in part because it does have this really important role in stress protection and proteostasis. But what's always puzzled me is that yeah, there are these intrinsically disordered proteins that do phase separate under different conditions, but what else gets incorporated into these membraneless organelles and are there sort of passive bystanders that get recruited? Are they still functional and what are they and what are sort of techniques that we can we can interrogate these processes?",

What got me interested in this topic is I'm interested in statistical mechanics in general and phase separation I think is a is a good statistical mechanics topic. I'm interested in nucleation, these kind of things, yeah.",

So my lab is interested in the function of RNA modifying enzymes mediated RNA modifications and RNA binding proteins in human disorders, particular cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. So we do a lot of CRISPR screening to identify the targets which are particularly important for certain cellular processes. We do liquid chromatography triple quad mass spec to to quantify the levels of modifications and my lab does high-throughput sequencing to look for those modified sites at the human genome. That's the three major techniques that we use. For phase separation, we have our interest lies on two directions. One thing we are particularly interested in nucleolus. We want to know whether the nucleolus is important for the biogenesis and the function of RNA modifications, especially ribosomal RNA modifications and vice versa, whether those modified sites that are participate influence the nucleolar condensates. Another thing is we are interested in sex-specific biocondenstate. My lab identified a list of proteins that is unique to male or females and they are all components in those condensates. So we wonder whether they would influence the condensate related sex-biased human disorders.",

And so we are interested in question of how signals are organized in space and time to give tissues their shape and function. We have done a bit of work on phase separation on some nuclear bodies, mainly with the idea of try to link the size that these droplets have to how much gene expression they can produce, sort of getting to question of size control and the relation between size and function.",

I studied liquid-liquid phase separation before using very, very coarse-grained models that we basically reduce proteins to single balls which interact with each other in a particular way, but we can generate phase diagrams that kind of match reality relatively reasonably well.
