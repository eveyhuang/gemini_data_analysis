      "transcript": "We've got all kinds of people joining us here plus a bot. Okay groovy. Um okay so we have an hour and 15 minutes to get ourselves organized so to speak in this uh session on phase separation. Okay so um welcome everybody. I'm Cathy Murphy. I know some of you already uh but uh maybe we'll and I guess I'm the only facilitator here. So maybe we can go around real quick. I'll call on people as I see you on my screen and uh uh what I'd like us to say uh is like your name where you you know what department and university you're from what your general thing is in terms of your science and then in terms of phase separation what your interests are in terms of this session. Okay so uh I'll make myself a template here. So I'm Cathy Murphy. I'm in chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I'm a nanoparticle person um and so we normally do a lot of synthesis and surface chemistry and some biological applications and some environmental implications. Um we are interested in uh some proteins that don't have a structure and like how they form a structure on a nanoparticle surface. So my interests in phase separation in a cell would kind of be along those lines uh like you know what's the role of proteins in particular that phase segregate in these little droplet things and you know like what do they do and uh what are they like and what's their life cycle and stuff like that. So I don't do that stuff myself but I'm very interested. Um but that's it's not about me it's all about you. Okay so uh Stephen from Johns Hopkins you're next on my screen. So uh can you tell us a little bit about yourself and then your interest in separation and then we'll have to also uh get a uh organize ourselves in terms of writing and reporting but let's go around the room first. And you're an expert at that because you already did it yesterday.",

      "transcript": "Yeah perfect. Um well hi everyone. Uh I'm Stephen Fried. Um I'm an assistant professor in chemistry and biophysics at Hopkins. Um I would say our lab is primarily a protein folding biophysics lab but we make use of a lot of proteomics technologies and basically try to repurpose them so that we can study protein folding sort of more holistically and on more complex systems than the kind of conventional model studies. Um I would say I got most interested in phase separation when I read Alan Drummond's um Cell paper from a few years ago that sort of proposed this idea that like um these proteins sort of coacervates could be functional and not just you know sort of a pathological state. Um but I'm really interested in trying to understand like do cells you know purposefully sort of package proteins away to try to protect them or does that carry some sort of proteostatic role um and then what allows the cell to then sort of be able to fix a protein you know scoop it back out of that um collection and resolubilize it again. So I'm really interested in questions like that.",

I'm an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in um chemistry and biological sciences and uh like Stephen I'm also interested in protein folding processes. Um but we actually look um more at um protein-protein interactions and the regulation and and dynamics of these complexes and proteostasis pathways um and how that's regulated in protein misfolding diseases and then also in virus infections how they uh viruses basically take uh advantage of um host cell um proteostasis processes. But um mass spectrometry is a great tool to study protein interactions so um that's also what what we use um mostly in the lab and then coupled with some chemical biology tricks and and methods development to kind of probe these processes. And um so why I'm interested in phase separation is um also um in part because it does have this really important um role in in stress protection and and um proteostasis but what what's always puzzled me is that yeah there are these intrinsically disordered proteins that um do phase separate under different conditions but there's um what else gets incorporated into these um these membraneless organelles and are there sort of passive ways that other proteins that get recruited um are they still functional and and what are they and what are sort of techniques that we can we can uh interrogate these processes.",

So my lab is interested in the function of RNA modifying uh enzymes mediated RNA modifications and RNA binding proteins in human disorders particularly cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. So we do a lot of CRISPR screening to identify the targets which are particularly important for certain cellular processes. We do liquid chromatography triple quad uh mass spec to to uh quantify the levels of modifications and my lab does high throughput sequencing to uh look for those modified sites at the human genome. That's the three major techniques that we use. Uh for phase separation we have our interest lies on two directions. One thing we are particularly interested in nucleolus. We want to know whether the nucleolus is important for the biogenesis and the function of RNA modifications especially ribosomal RNA modifications and vice versa whether those modified sites that are partic uh participate influence the nuclear ola condensates. Another thing is we are interested in uh sex specific biocondenstate. My lab identified a list of proteins that is unique to male or females and they are all components in those condensates. So we wonder whether they would influence uh the condensate related sex biased human disorders.",

We are mainly interested in development and regeneration using quantitative imaging methods and so we are interested in question of how signals are organized in space and time to give tissues their shape and function. We have done a bit of work on phase separation on some nuclear bodies mainly with the idea of try to link the size that these droplets have to how much gene expression they can produce sort of getting to question of size control and the relation between size and function.",
