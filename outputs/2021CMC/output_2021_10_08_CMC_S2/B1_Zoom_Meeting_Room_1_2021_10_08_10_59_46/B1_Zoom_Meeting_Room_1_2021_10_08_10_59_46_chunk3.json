But I guess I wanted I hope I'm not setting us back if I pick up on what Steven said. I feel like it is important to distinguish between a phase separated you know kind of this transition phase transition and just things that stick together. There's fundamentally different physics or different dynamics going on there. I don't know is that is that true? I'm not an expert in this at all so.",

So I think that it's probably fair to say that most experiments that are done by cell biologists fail to give a level of evidence to really prove that. Which I used to be very hung up on but now I'm just sort of more like you know whatever they are they're still probably important.",

So we had a nice discussion yesterday about crowded environments and in the context of that I actually learned a few really interesting things. So that the cytoplasm of cells is basically close to a glass forming liquid and when the metabolism stops it actually becomes more solid-like and it really changes its mechanical properties. And you have these these condensates forming kind of in the mixer of that and their thermodynamic equilibrium state is basically they would coalesce into one huge liquid and they don't do that they kind of stay at a certain size. How how is that possible?",
