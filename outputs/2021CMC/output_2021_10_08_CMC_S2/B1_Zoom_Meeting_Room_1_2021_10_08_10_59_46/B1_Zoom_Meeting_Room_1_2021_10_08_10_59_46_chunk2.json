            "transcript": "Hi, I am Allie Obermeyer. I am an assistant professor in the chemical engineering department at Columbia. And my group broadly works in the protein and polymer engineering space. So we're frequently trying to engineer and understand protein interactions with both synthetic polymers and biopolymers. And so one of those type of interactions can or many of them, but one that we're particularly interested in can result in phase separation of proteins both in an in vitro system for applications in protein purification and formulation. But then also we have been engineering proteins to artificially control their phase separation inside of living cells. So we do this in bacteria and tuning electrostatic interactions to control phase separation to identify minimal sequences that can promote phase separation and then potentially use these for for engineering purposes. So yeah, so super interested in better better tools to understand the systems we're engineering and and yeah, how we can potentially use some of the things we've engineered to to probe some biological phase separation.",

There was a lab emergency, but yeah, Masha Kamenetska from Boston University. I'm an assistant professor of chemistry and physics. Nice to see all of you again. So we are kind of a techniques lab, so we design and then apply single molecule techniques to answer interesting questions in biology and also in material science systems. So, you know, some of the things I heard about is maybe some things we could measure, for example, mechanical properties of these condensates. So for example, we use optical tweezers where we can apply force to a single droplet or we could apply force to a bead that's then conjugated to a biomolecule and we can then pull a single molecule and get information such as energy landscapes, transition states. So, yeah, so that's kind of the game we play. We design single molecule techniques and then look for interesting systems to apply them to.",

And actually we talked yesterday a little bit among the facilitators and it also seems to be helpful to have a a scribe. So one person will just sort of like take notes, you know, like listen and and contribute but also take notes. And then someone else will actually be the person that we all help put together is going to present, okay. So I'll I'll first ask if there's any volunteers to be either the scribe or the reporter. I mean, I'll be taking some notes too, but if I try to do too many things, it's not going to go well. So, okay, so if there's if there are volunteers, that's awesome. And if not, then I'll have to do some kind of randomization thing to to pick people. And Stephen, you're off the hook because you did it yesterday. And if anybody else did it yesterday and I have forgotten that, just let me know. But okay, so scribe or report scribe or reporter, scribe or reporter.",
