So the other question is whether we are talking of a real phase separation or it's just things sticking together and there is a focus on the heterogeneity of of these environments. The yeah, I don't think we need to well, okay. There is a question about the composition of these droplets that came out lately and how can it be probed? There are various techniques like mass spectrometry, sequencing, proteomics and whatever else. The problem, one of the problems is isolating these droplets. And then there was a discussion about probes of I mean like in situ probes to for example measure local temperature or supply energy locally and see what happens. And the techniques that came out and that are somewhat available now, we're talking about super resolution microscopy, fluorescent dyes, small molecules or nanoparticles, there are plasmonic nanoparticles also we haven't talked about it, magnetic rotors that can probe viscosity.",

Yeah, I have this just like to be contrarian, is that you know these are all macromolecules that are reasonably high concentration, so why wouldn't they phase separate? And so is it actually the opposite is that everything has a tendency to phase separate and the cell spends energy to keep it in phase.",

And I wasn't familiar with this until until very recently. But it's really multivalency it's like kind of hydrophobic collapse would happen which happens with protein folding in a way too. So then the question is is it really the same processes that control globular protein folding versus assembly of these these phase separated aggregates?",
