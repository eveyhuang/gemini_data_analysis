      "transcript": "fact that that a computer can predict a structure at all for so much of the proteome. I was almost wondering for the people who work in this field, were they surprised? Because the algorithms that people typically use predict disorder like Disopred and IUPred, they'll give you these numbers like oh like 70, 80% of the human proteome is disordered. It's like well if that's true then how come a computer can predict structures for like 50% of the proteome and like 90% of like the E. coli proteome. So like to me, I thought that was like very much inconsistent with sort of like the view that like Julie Forman-Kay has been proposing that like this is just as common in bacteria as it is in eukaryotes. Like I don't think they can possibly be consistent with like what we know about how structured proteomes really are. So. I don't want to be too controversial but that's just been something I've been thinking a lot about.",

So you can see how much heterogeneity there is in a cell. Have people done something like that? It would seems like a pretty straightforward. Or would that be valuable I don't know.",

The more common thing would be to have like a bunch of cells in a matrix and then the cells are moving in the matrix and you got some kind of beads in there and you can look at the displacement of the beads and then infer how the cell is moving",
