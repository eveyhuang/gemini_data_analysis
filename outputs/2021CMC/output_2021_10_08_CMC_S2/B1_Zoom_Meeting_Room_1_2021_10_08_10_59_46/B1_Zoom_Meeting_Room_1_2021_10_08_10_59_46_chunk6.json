Like I mean I'm familiar with the example I'm familiar with is through development too they they can form and they can sort of sequester certain RNA messages and then that's a really that that's probably a really tightly regulated process, right? Because you have to have the right the right temporal control in this in this case. And so yeah, how whether that's signaled by post-translational modifications or some other mechanism I think.",

      "transcript": "I really like the Cathy's earlier comment that this is really the cell to take certain pathway to into their own pocket. But it stimulated me to think there is a optical limitation about the size of different puncta upon different sizes. I will introduce one example in my field. G3BP1 was considered as the core protein and the only one if you knock out that there will be no stress granules. However, another lab, a lab at Harvard, they actually used a super resolution microscopy and they identified N6-methyladenosine reader protein which is a RNA modification reader protein. They phase separate themselves and you can only see those phase separated puncta using super resolution microscopy and they serve as the seed to call for other proteins to join at only certain conditions to form different types of puncta. So there is a hypothesis in the field in the functional field that different size with different component compositions of the protein and RNAs would specialize those puncta condensate whatever you call them to different functions. So it says do matter I think.",

So they are nucleating they're appearing through a nucleation and growth mechanism. So yeah, so what is nucleating the formation of the condensate?",

That that's driven by at least shown by Clifford Brangwynne is driven by ribosomal biogenesis, the small subunit and joining the large subunit and along with biogenesis you have more and more of those components inside the nucleolus you drive that condensate to form along cell cycle.",

It's very biophysical and have all equilibrium and has all energy dissipation and surface extension angles this and that. I didn't really get into details but it seems to use a very biophysical approaches to narrow out but it's still left in the discussion I think who drives whom.",

      "timestamp": "04:02-05:17",
      "transcript": "There is though, I mean I think probably a nicer system for this has been some experiment in fly embryos because what's nice about the early fly embryo you get no transcription and then at the right after sorry. After 13 division you get transcription to start and you know all the proteins that make the nucleolus are loaded in the embryo so they are all there but for the first 13 cycles you don't see any nucleolus and then as transcription starts at the maternal zygotic transition you get nucleolus form. So the flies go by the first two hours of its life a fly embryo without any nucleolus in it and then as soon as you get transcription you you you start getting the droplet. And the same is true for the histone locus body. That's actually has been something that we have done in my lab has been you know you get them at about the same time and you get them as soon as you start transcribing. So without RNA they could still form but they're much smaller. So I don't know if RNA is necessarily the the you know the nucleator but it's definitely catalyzing the formation at least in the fly embryo. I don't know in the cells maybe the problem gets there some in cells in culture I don't know but it's a nice place where you can separate it because there's no transcription.",
