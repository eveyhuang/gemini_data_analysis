      "transcript": "you could do an experiment where you heat parts of the cell very locally and see what that does. But it seems like actually the opposite of that is also really interesting. If you could detect temperature at very local places, then presumably if it requires burning energy to keep something together, then that little portion must be hotter. And so if you could also detect heat evolution at a very like microscopic length scale, that would be really compelling.",
