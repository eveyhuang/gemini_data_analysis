And you know and it's a complicated thing that involves everything the way the funding goes the way the publishing goes. So I think a solution would have to involve something that goes way beyond a department or a department head you know.",

      "transcript": "I think this discussion of numbers also number of students has to relate not just to when they're in the PhD program and the grant agencies are incentivizing lots of publications and that but like also after they finish as well. So I have my my husband discusses this with me a bit like he decided not to go into academia because he really believes there's too many PhDs. He struggled getting jobs we got to we saw a lot of our colleagues during our PhD programs struggle with that. So not just mentoring them while they're in the lab but also can they get a job that requires their training as well. I'm thinking about that.",

But it's hard but it's hard I think to learn some of those skills.",

      "transcript": "So so one thing I I mean I think so it is true it's like such a systemic problem and how do you approach that but one thing that we might consider more often is actually giving mentees skills that allow them to mentor up because then they can be more of a consumer right they can you know that has to start from day one you know talking to them about what is a lab culture and how will that support you in developing your career and how will you know how does this person's personality and way of working jive with your personality and your way of working. You know like my ultimate dream would be that we could actually get them to choose four mentors that are great for them and you know choose a little less often those mentors that are you know not not so great but may have all of those you know I don't know the huge lab that just everybody thinks they want to go to. So I think you know like really giving the both teaching the mentees the the students some skills as well as like just telling them like it's okay to be selective about you know your choosing your mentor and it's okay to be proactive about what you want for yourself. You know gives them some of the power they and they don't always realize they actually have some they do have a little bit you know they have a little they have some they do have some power. They certainly you know should be making choices that are best for themselves and we should be telling them you should make choices that are best for you. So I really like this idea of giving mentees skills and building mentee skills and making them better mentees and helping them actually figure out how to work with some of these mentors. I mean sometimes you know I it doesn't seem to me like people usually have bad intent. Sometimes they're just oblivious.",
