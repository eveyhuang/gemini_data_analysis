There just isn't anything. Maybe it's because dynamics is more heterogeneous and it's harder to do than for structure, I don't know.",

I was going to say I think that maybe one of the issues is that you know a lot of the metrics for awards and funding and so forth are based on publications and like if there was another dimension to establish oneself as sort of having an expertise in a certain field that was equally recognized I think that would potentially be because like a lot of there's a lot of bean counting in different fields and and you know there's a sort of an inclination to look at how many papers and then where your name is on the paper which to what whatever extent is a metric but I think also in different fields it's very different and in different contexts and different types of science you can have contributions that would be probably put on the author list differently. And so if there was some way to sort of get away from like numbers of papers or numbers of citations or order of your name on the paper like some genuine way to do it that's not just you know everybody gets credit for everything but like you can recognize excellence in a way that wasn't just indexed by numbers and author lists that was genuine that people could access and use I think that would be that would help I think.",

But now with all these databases you can click on H indices or whatever all that stuff is you know that's what people do because it's quick and easy to do. So and it and there's deep implicit biases there right you know people do this automatically and and I think this is one of those areas that's actually worth training people on. Like for instance I think the University of Illinois wastes a lot of time on ethics training that is not relevant to the kinds of things that we need to deal with because you know we're in Illinois and our government is corrupt and so we need to go through all of this sort of stuff. They could actually spend like half an hour of that time on on hidden biases in in you know how you interpret people's literatures resume even when you look at Google Scholar or something like that you know how do you look at that and not get tricked and and so and that's a very difficult",

So I like as a note of encouragement you know that's why no no single number fits all and the numbers aren't usually put to the very forefront but it still leaves us with the funding. How do you feel that funding views all of the current state of science and do you think there are barriers for you there?",

As far as I'm aware at at least in University of California or maybe this is specific to UC Irvine there's I think there is a lot of effort in training and bias training when it comes to hiring but I don't see really any of that happening at the level of promotion because it seems like when it gets back to sort of once people are hired and it's at the level of promotion there is a lot of this like falling back onto you know sort of the the metrics and the databases and and without really I've never heard anybody mention that these things might be biased.",

People who opted out by hiding their identity the reviewers this is the interpretation of the data the reviewers interpreted that as I am of quote unquote lower status and ergo should have gained a benefit from it but the opposite happened that they were assumed that lower they they were awarded that lower status regardless of what their real status may have been. and so",
