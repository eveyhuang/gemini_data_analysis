Um and some of us have a lot of experience so we can um you know, give you weigh in, but it's for you to discuss. Um and I think um I'd love to hear what you guys think works well and what doesn't work well in terms of um you know, scientific progress uh because we're all beholden to getting funding and promoted.

And so if there was some way to sort of get away from like numbers of papers or numbers of citations or order of your name on the paper like some genuine way to do it that's not just you know everybody gets credit for everything but like you can recognize excellence in a way that wasn't just indexed by numbers and author lists that was genuine that people could access and use I think that would be that would help I think.",

And so there's this gatekeeping in intro science that's really I think unfortunate but maybe that's kind of on a younger level than what we're trying to discuss in this breakout room but how do we tell them that they can be scientists without needing to be extraordinary if they don't want to or need to.",

You know like my ultimate dream would be that we could actually get them to choose four mentors that are great for them and you know choose a little less often those mentors that are you know not not so great but may have all of those you know I don't know the huge lab that just everybody thinks they want to go to. So I think you know like really giving the both teaching the mentees the the students some skills as well as like just telling them like it's okay to be selective about you know your choosing your mentor and it's okay to be proactive about what you want for yourself. Um you know gives them some of the power they and they don't always realize they actually have some they do have a little bit you know they have a little they have some they do have some power. Um they certainly you know should be making choices that are best for themselves and we should be telling them you should make choices that are best for you. Um so I I really like this idea of giving mentees skills and building mentee skills and making them better mentees um and helping them actually figure out how to work with some of these mentors. I mean sometimes you know I it's I it doesn't seem to me like people usually have bad intent. Sometimes they're just oblivious.",

Sometimes I've found personally that like student support groups can be very effective at at being able to navigate some of the specific tensions and issues that students are encountering at a certain place in their career. But I think the other the other point that I was going to bring up is just you know all of the things that we were talking about the topics of of stress and expectations and sort of conformism if that's a thing is really kind of limiting the creativity of of students I think and I think that's really a crisis for science right now because even I think there was like potentially a time when there was a lot more freedom and just sort of individual just passion for something that may or may not have been recognized but when you're at a certain stage you don't know what's cool and what's not cool and I think that you know as things become more systematic and more processed and you have all of these metrics that are applied at earlier and earlier levels of how to get into grad school and you're in grad school how many papers you need and who you need to work for and what postdoc you need to get I think that's really eroding the creative thought of a lot of our students and and that's a problem and it would be nice to build in some mechanisms to just sort of reinvigorate sort of a curiosity that doesn't have as many consequences if it doesn't pan out in their CV. So if there were ways to sort of do that you know reintroduce that at the grad graduate student level I think that would really sort of at least help people preserve some sort of like naive creativity which is really helpful and useful in all discussions.",

I totally agree. But I still have a feeling you know having observed how this used to work you know and and how it's working now that if you're going to err on the 100-0 versus 0-100 side you're better on the 0-100 side where the 100 is the student's than the other way around.
