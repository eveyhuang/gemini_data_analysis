And um I think this topic is not typical for the the kinds of things we've discussed before, but I think it's something a lot of people are very passionate about because I think it might be that modifying human behavior is much harder than studying science as the whole past pandemic has shown us. There's no better illustration than that. So um I guess um I'm really interested to hear everyone's thoughts and contributions about how um I guess how to make science better. Um and some of us have a lot of experience so we can um you know, give you weigh in, but it's for you to discuss. Um and I think um I'd love to hear what you guys think works well and what doesn't work well in terms of um you know, scientific progress uh because we're all beholden to getting funding and promoted. And so are there things that are not working in that regard? If there is anything that's working well, let me know, but usually people have a lot more they think that is not working well. Um and so we'll do that and then we'll we'll brainstorm up some changes and uh and then we'll lastly touch on mentoring and we have an hour about to get through all this. So um I will ask for any volunteers to lead off on our first question, which is what about our current frameworks? What are your loves and hates? Stephen.",

I think it'll be great to have so many people's opinion. I maybe wanted to like sort of just like start with the topic of like open science because it's a topic that I care a lot about. So we work like in the proteomics field so we kind of you know, I guess do like the basic stuff of like you know putting our data sets on pride so that you know anyone can look at them. You know in that sense we're not doing anything too revolutionary. Like we're way behind I think what structural biologists have been doing. Um but I'm like just really interested in general in this idea of like you know how do we sort of make all of like the data including like the so-called negative results that we you know don't know how to interpret like available and indexable so that we can sort of like fuel the next like AI breakthrough because I feel like the fact that structural biologists had their house in order so well you know we just kind of have you know this like amazing victory to like savor for it and like you know personally I would wish that we could say the same thing for proteomics and I'm sure many of the people here would you know be able to make the extrapolation to their field as well.",
