So not just mentoring them while they're in the lab but also can they get a job that requires their training as well and thinking about that.",

You know like my ultimate dream would be that we could actually get them to choose four mentors that are great for them and you know choose a little less often those mentors that are you know not not so great but may have all of those you know I don't know the huge lab that just everybody thinks they want to go to. So I think you know like really giving the both teaching the mentees the the students some skills as well as like just telling them like it's okay to be selective about you know your choosing your mentor and it's okay to be proactive about what you want for yourself. Um you know gives them some of the power they and they don't always realize they actually have some they do have a little bit you know they have a little they have some they do have some power. Um they certainly you know should be making choices that are best for themselves and we should be telling them you should make choices that are best for you. Um so I I really like this idea of giving mentees skills and building mentee skills and making them better mentees um and helping them actually figure out how to work with some of these mentors. I mean sometimes you know I it's I it doesn't seem to me like people usually have bad intent. Sometimes they're just oblivious.",

But I wonder if thinking rethinking some of these like traditional group structures that's led by a single PI um and that maybe having a diversity of mentors that are all working together towards some larger common goal um you know even if you have like a primary person that you report to you would have that natural structure of other people that are um senior as anyways it was just a very interesting new structure that I I think someone even at the Scialog just said that he moved to make a joint group at a new institution so um I don't know if anybody has heard of that.",

So I feel like awareness is better but it is a really urgent need you know because a student in distress can be gone in a matter of months not you know so it's it's a pretty serious issue. But I do think institutions do have a role by insisting and I think the NIH has a role by acknowledging because right now when you send in your bio sketch I usually do mention mentoring in there but it's not part of the typical form right and I you know thankfully I work at a school that does account for mentoring at promotion if someone has any hint of an issue with mentoring in all of those letters that come in from around the world there will be a discussion you know because we take it very seriously but that could be a value for every school.
