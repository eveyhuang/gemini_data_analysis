And so if there was some way to sort of get away from like numbers of papers or numbers of citations or order of your name on the paper like some genuine way to do it that's not just you know everybody gets credit for everything but like you can recognize excellence in a way that wasn't just indexed by numbers and author lists that was genuine that people could access and use I think that would be that would help I think.

But now with all these databases you can click on H indices or whatever all that stuff is you know that's what people do because it's quick and easy to do. So and it and there's deep implicit biases there right you know people do this automatically and and I think this is one of those areas that's actually worth training people on. Like for instance I think the University of Illinois wastes a lot of time on ethics training that is not relevant to the kinds of things that we need to deal with because you know we're in Illinois and our government is corrupt and so we need to go through all of this sort of stuff.
