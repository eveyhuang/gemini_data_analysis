            "transcript": "NSF actually funded departments by giving them training grants and that was not the exception which it is now where you're lucky if you're a student you get into a biophysics training grant but 90% chance your advisor has to support you on something. 90% of the students were paid on training grants and they could shop around for advisors and they had the money. And when you were on one of these training grants you knew exactly how much you were going to TA and how much time you had for research because there couldn't be the surprise your your advisor suddenly doesn't have funding right if you got that funding you had it. So I would be a big advocate in fact for somehow changing the entire funding system that's a big big big problem. So that it's not focused on individual PIs and requiring them to get a lot of stuff done and then exploiting students to get them done because right now right in this system if I get an NIH grant and have a student that's been working in my lab for four years and they're really good now I stick around for another four years right I'm going to get more out of you than out of a second year grad student that's just starting. And this is the kind of thing Erica whether isn't anything the department heads really do or the deans do they're part of the problem right?",

It's so hard to run a graduate program now that we are keenly aware of exactly how long everyone's taking to get through their grad school. So it's you know that's actually kind of I agree with you a mature graduate student is often in the prime of their creative life and it's but it's in their best interest to leave and now we actually have institutional you know self-monitored pressure to do so because we really want to get the grants back.

We are overtraining because they are cheap because they are the workforce of science and you know how do you go around that right? Can you really even make enough training grants for everyone and so do you think that's a problem? Do you think that's you know how do you address that?",

It's made you know why you know why am I doing this but but in a sense of like collective morale I think that that in my group thing you know it was a struggle to get people motivated because I wasn't motivated. I wanted to hunker down with my family and not you know not work like I worked up to that point. Um and but also like over Zoom it's really challenging to celebrate accomplishments. It's it's really easy to talk about research with your students and your group and your peers and to get down to business and to minimize the time that you're on Zoom and and like I felt like for a year almost every interaction every virtual interaction had a harshness to it you know because we couldn't have lunch and we couldn't have drinks and we couldn't just you know physically applaud each other or shake each other's hands when something great happened in the group. Um we couldn't take pictures together we couldn't go to the park together you know so it's so there's yeah and collectively the grad students can't get together and share their experiences as easily like is this toxic or is this just stressful is this um are you being treated this way you know like their their ability to have these kinds of conversations are are very limited so that they can't you know they can't they might not know what's normal and be able to stand up for themselves as easily.",

I mean we've had to have multiple group meetings now where it's like this is what it's like to work in lab right like you know like you know you learned for a year and a half how you could work at home and and get something done but that's not going to work for the entirety of your PhD right so now it's time to get back into lab and like what are you know like how many hours should you be thinking about spending in lab and",
