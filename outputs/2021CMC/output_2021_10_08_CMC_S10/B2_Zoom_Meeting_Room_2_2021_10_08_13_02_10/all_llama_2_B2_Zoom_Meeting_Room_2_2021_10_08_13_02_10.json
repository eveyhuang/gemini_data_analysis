There's no better illustration than that. So um I guess um I'm really interested to hear everyone's thoughts and contributions about how um I guess how to make science better. Um and some of us have a lot of experience so we can um you know, give you weigh in, but it's for you to discuss. Um and I think um I'd love to hear what you guys think works well and what doesn't work well in terms of um you know, scientific progress uh because we're all beholden to getting funding and promoted. And so are there things that are not working in that regard? If there is anything that's working well, let me know, but usually people have a lot more they think that is not working well. Um and so we'll do that and then we'll we'll brainstorm up some changes and uh and then we'll lastly touch on mentoring and we have an hour about to get through all this.

You know in that sense we're not doing anything too revolutionary. Like we're way behind I think what structural biologists have been doing. Um but I'm like just really interested in general in this idea of like you know how do we sort of make all of like the data including like the so-called negative results that we you know don't know how to interpret like available and indexable so that we can sort of like fuel the next like AI breakthrough because I feel like the fact that structural biologists had their house in order so well you know we just kind of have you know this like amazing victory to like savor for it and like you know personally I would wish that we could say the same thing for proteomics and I'm sure many of the people here would you know be able to make the extrapolation to their field as well.",

And so if there was some way to sort of get away from like numbers of papers or numbers of citations or order of your name on the paper like some genuine way to do it that's not just you know everybody gets credit for everything but like you can recognize excellence in a way that wasn't just indexed by numbers and author lists that was genuine that people could access and use I think that would be that would help I think.",

But now with all these databases you can click on H indices or whatever all that stuff is you know that's what people do because it's quick and easy to do. So and it and there's deep implicit biases there right you know people do this automatically and and I think this is one of those areas that's actually worth training people on. Like for instance I think the University of Illinois wastes a lot of time on ethics training that is not relevant to the kinds of things that we need to deal with because you know we're in Illinois and our government is corrupt and so we need to go through all of this sort of stuff. They could actually spend like half an hour of that time on on hidden biases in in you know how you interpret people's literatures resume even when you look at Google Scholar or something like that you know how do you look at that and not get tricked and and so and that's a very difficult",

And so there's this gatekeeping in intro science that's really I think unfortunate but maybe that's kind of on a younger level than what we're trying to discuss in this breakout room but how do we tell them that they can be scientists without needing to be extraordinary if they don't want to or need to.",

And when you were on one of these training grants you knew exactly how much you were going to TA and how much time you had for research because there couldn't be the surprise your your advisor suddenly doesn't have funding right if you got that funding you had it. So I would be a big advocate in fact for somehow changing the entire funding system that's a big big big problem. So that it's not focused on individual PIs and requiring them to get a lot of stuff done and then exploiting students to get them done because right now right in this system if I get an NIH grant and have a student that's been working in my lab for four years and they're really good now I stick around for another four years right I'm going to get more out of you than out of a second year grad student that's just starting. And this is the kind of thing Erica whether isn't anything the department heads really do or the deans do they're part of the problem right?",

You know like my ultimate dream would be that we could actually get them to choose four mentors that are great for them and you know choose a little less often those mentors that are you know not not so great but may have all of those you know I don't know the huge lab that just everybody thinks they want to go to. So I think you know like really giving the both teaching the mentees the the students some skills as well as like just telling them like it's okay to be selective about you know your choosing your mentor and it's okay to be proactive about what you want for yourself. Um you know gives them some of the power they and they don't always realize they actually have some they do have a little bit you know they have a little they have some they do have some power. Um they certainly you know should be making choices that are best for themselves and we should be telling them you should make choices that are best for you.

Sometimes I've found personally that like student support groups can be very effective at at being able to navigate some of the specific tensions and issues that students are encountering at a certain place in their career. But I think the other the other point that I was going to bring up is just you know all of the things that we were talking about the topics of of stress and expectations and sort of conformism if that's a thing is really kind of limiting the creativity of of students I think and I think that's really a crisis for science right now because even I think there was like potentially a time when there was a lot more freedom and just sort of individual just passion for something that may or may not have been recognized but when you're at a certain stage you don't know what's cool and what's not cool and I think that you know as things become more systematic and more processed and you have all of these metrics that are applied at earlier and earlier levels of how to get into grad school and you're in grad school how many papers you need and who you need to work for and what postdoc you need to get I think that's really eroding the creative thought of a lot of our students and and that's a problem and it would be nice to build in some mechanisms to just sort of reinvigorate sort of a curiosity that doesn't have as many consequences if it doesn't pan out in their CV. So if there were ways to sort of do that you know reintroduce that at the grad graduate student level I think that would really sort of at least help people preserve some sort of like naive creativity which is really helpful and useful in all discussions.",

You know and if if not then I need to stick with this person that that has money to to pay me. Whereas if you pay the students then you know they can shop around.

Obviously the optimal solution really would be somehow something where the faculty member has an investment the student has an investment and maybe it should be 80-20 not not 0-100 or 100-0. I totally agree. But I still have a feeling you know having observed how this used to work you know and and how it's working now that if you're going to err on the 100-0 versus 0-100 side you're better on the 0-100 side where the 100 is the student's than the other way around.
