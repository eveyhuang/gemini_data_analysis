And so if there was some way to sort of get away from like numbers of papers or numbers of citations or order of your name on the paper like some genuine way to do it that's not just you know everybody gets credit for everything but like you can recognize excellence in a way that wasn't just indexed by numbers and author lists that was genuine that people could access and use I think that would be that would help I think.

But now with all these databases you can click on H indices or whatever all that stuff is you know that's what people do because it's quick and easy to do. So and it and there's deep implicit biases there right you know people do this automatically and and I think this is one of those areas that's actually worth training people on.

And when you were on one of these training grants you knew exactly how much you were going to TA and how much time you had for research because there couldn't be the surprise your your advisor suddenly doesn't have funding right if you got that funding you had it. So I would be a big advocate in fact for somehow changing the entire funding system that's a big big big problem. So that it's not focused on individual PIs and requiring them to get a lot of stuff done and then exploiting students to get them done because right now right in this system if I get an NIH grant and have a student that's been working in my lab for four years and they're really good now I stick around for another four years right I'm going to get more out of you than out of a second year grad student that's just starting.

You know like my ultimate dream would be that we could actually get them to choose four mentors that are great for them and you know choose a little less often those mentors that are you know not not so great but may have all of those you know I don't know the huge lab that just everybody thinks they want to go to. So I think you know like really giving the both teaching the mentees the the students some skills as well as like just telling them like it's okay to be selective about you know your choosing your mentor and it's okay to be proactive about what you want for yourself. Um you know gives them some of the power they and they don't always realize they actually have some they do have a little bit you know they have a little they have some they do have some power. Um they certainly you know should be making choices that are best for themselves and we should be telling them you should make choices that are best for you. Um so I I really like this idea of giving mentees skills and building mentee skills and making them better mentees um and helping them actually figure out how to work with some of these mentors.
