What do we actually value, what is a good scientist? And I kind of think that this has to change if we're going to change the face of science. We need to grow a bigger appreciation for different kinds of skill sets and what different kinds of people can bring that's not, first of all, may not be credentialed in the way that we're used to, and it may mean that we have to think harder about what skills can really push our science forward. Do you always have to be a leader to push science forward?",

So Karen Fleming in our biophysics department here has been, we're piloting a sort of a hiring I guess strategy that I think was developed by one of the departments at Yale, maybe Caitlyn knows, I don't know who, but where the first round of the process will be anonymous where basically the candidates will have to prepare statements about their prior research experience, their future plans, their teaching statement, etcetera in a way that sort of would not reveal who they've worked for and sort of create this implicit bias of essentially without us saying it out loud we tend to hire people from the same few institutes and the same few labs within those institutes and so I'm really excited to see what happens with it.",

So when I teach freshman chemistry I have this writing assignment early on where I ask them to flip through the textbook for five minutes and think about representation in the textbook and when the students write about whether or not they could find any human beings because maybe in five minutes if they have a slow internet connection and they're looking through the ebook they don't find somebody doing chemistry in their general chemistry textbook but a lot of them sometimes they find like Dmitri Mendeleev or Marie Curie and some of them say, I'll never be, I don't want to be a famous chemist or I'll never be a famous chemist and these intro textbooks they don't tell you that you can be a professional and you can be a leader without being a pioneer. And so there's this gatekeeping in intro science that's really I think unfortunate but maybe that's kind of on a younger level than what we're trying to discuss in this breakout room but how do we tell them that they can be scientists without needing to be extraordinary if they don't want to or need to.",

            "transcript": "Yeah it was going to comment on some of the hiring stuff and I think I can bring in Nathan's comment as well that I was at a conference last week that was faculty and some postdocs getting ready for the job market and this was a point of discussion that can we recognize that great science can be done in many places and you don't just need to be coming from a top 10, have an experience at a top 10 institution because all the faculty there that talked about their last hires in the past five years they were all like yeah everybody was from these set institutions and that's limiting the ideas too because those are people that are only exposed to set groups and set things. So I think looping in Nathan's comment that not just a historical leader but like these easy metrics of groups and universities you can also make an impact and be a good scientist and have creative ideas even if you aren't coming from those places.",

A lot of people I feel like will list people that they knew from graduate school or if you went to Berkeley then all of your people who you went to graduate school at Berkeley are now professors somewhere in the country or I feel like there's some kind of a buddy buddy system where if you didn't go to one of those top 10 institutions and you can't name drop people that you know at all the other institutions there's I don't know that that's a problem and then it feels like people who aren't in that upper echelon aren't part of the, don't have an edge in being able to get through the tenure process and getting started in their lab. I think they work harder and it's it's something that kind of has always bothered me a little bit that it seems like there's inequities yeah.",

It's definitely great to have it happen here but it doesn't need to necessarily happen in our university environments so maybe we can all be catalysts for change in that arena. You can say hey I would like one of my faculty meetings a month to be a brainstorm session right?",

And part of it has to do with the way we exploit young people just from the amount of time that we get out of them to do things. So to give you an example my advisor got his PhD at age 23 and had a faculty job at Berkeley with three publications at age 27. And I got mine at age 24 and had a faculty job at Illinois at age 28. And my students are getting their PhDs at age 29 and if they're lucky if they're done with their postdoc at 35 and getting a faculty job. And I don't think it's because my advisor was a hyper genius and I'm a genius and my students are morons. They're the same people.",
