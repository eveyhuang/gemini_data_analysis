You see for that's why I nod a lot when I heard the ribosome. A lot of ribosome modifications unlike messenger RNA modifications which are at the low stoichiometry, ribosome modifications are at nearly 100% is evolutional conserved. And but if you do an in vitro reaction it's very hard to get to 100% modified no matter how hard you try. In cells in the nucleolus is always 100% so I'm really curious about how those condensation state whether and how it promotes the biogenesis and the function of ribosome modification. And whether it's similarly or differently regulated as a chromatin state modifications.",

And you know this could you know in some some of the work that we're doing on this um some has to do with with you know surface protein reorganization and so and we're also interested in doing this in the context of the epigenome and you end up with really variable time scales you know you could you could have you might have to wait a really long time or or you might just by chance you know not have to wait very long for these things to happen and so I guess back to Judith's question about measurements it's like the dynamics of that seems very very difficult to measure to actually sort of get a grip on sort of this very dynamic process of you know things are crowded yes but they're also transiently you know uncrowded right and so so how do you actually get a grip on those dynamic processes.",

Um you know is that happening actively is it happening just through the passive diffusion and so you know what are the time scales associated with with with that occurring. So it should happen you know on the order of seconds if it's going to you know enable you know according to measurements that people have made of T-cell activation. Um but if you just try to when we just simulate this in in passive uh um models then it it can take way way way longer you know much too long to be sort of physiologically relevant. But that's just just one example.",
