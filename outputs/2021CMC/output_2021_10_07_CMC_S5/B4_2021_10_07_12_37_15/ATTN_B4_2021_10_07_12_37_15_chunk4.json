      "transcript": "but we don't think about okay how does molecule C interfere with that how does it move out of the way. And for that the interactions of C and B and C and A are of course also important. But if you have multiple FRET pairs that you can monitor all at the same time in different channels you may be able to kind of disentangle that and then actually explain some of the more general mechanical properties that you can observe. That would be fantastic. Tall order.",

      "transcript": "So we have a microscope where we've monitored protein RNA binding partners who are part of the spliceosome and we can do exactly what you described. So label one partner with one fluorophore and the other with another and monitor FRET between them and we use temperature perturbations to get on and off rates as well as binding affinities and then mapping that to regions of the cell. So we see differences in affinity in vitro in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus and I do have some evidence for differences in droplets at least for motion into and out of the droplet at different temperatures. So it's something we can look at and we've built a three-color system to try and do assembly. But something I'm also interested is in the structure and the activity inside the droplets and so PFK for example is thought to form a filament structure and that's been seen in vitro but not in cells. So using infrared spectroscopy or infrared imaging we're hoping to look at the actual structure in the droplets and then by using infrared labels in a region that is free of infrared modes monitor activity associated with those different structures. And then we use our perturbation techniques to cause phase separation to occur and look at changes in the activity. So we get kind of a spatial map of activity in the cell.",

      "transcript": "So by FRET you can increase right but each color diminishes the amount of FRET that you see. So I think three is a reasonable goal for us right now but then by moving the third probe you can map everything together. So keep two the same and move the third and then in the end you can overlay everything. Then in the infrared you're unlimited in your probes right because we have basically two million vibrational spectra from 800 wave numbers out to 2000 wave numbers. So if
