            "transcript": "So I come from a protein folding background to put this in context. And I feel like in the folding field, if we think about crowding, we can predict what's going to happen to proteins based on crowding alone. So crowding stabilizes proteins, it stabilizes binding interactions, and and so from that perspective from a well-structured protein, we can make pretty good predictions. But what we don't understand is how the other parts of the environment are affecting the stability of proteins or predicting how like non-steric interactions are affecting the protein interactions. So I thought this was a nice juxtaposition to what Paul was saying about his specific system.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I would I would very much agree with that is very much a point that I wrote down too that we understand crowding in terms of volume exclusion that there is limited volume that usually stabilizes either aggregation or compact folds or stuff like that, but we don't understand the effects of attractive interactions which if you have things that strongly attract each other, they will precipitate out of course. But in in the cell you are surrounded by a myriad of other potential interaction partners. These interactions are not necessarily strong, but they're not zero or repulsive either and how they can affect for example biomolecular assembly, the formation of complexes and everything is very densely packed. So what Paul was was mentioning, are there any collective dynamic effects like hydrodynamics, how do they affect not only the biomolecular assembly which is a thermodynamic problem but also how things move in the cell dynamically.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I think a related question is in these phase-separated granules which are concentrating certain proteins, a lot of these are I'm interested in RNA binding proteins. A lot of these are RNA binding proteins and so they have some binding specificity and that might be on the nanomolar range but then in these condensates they're micromolar and so do they still maintain this specificity when they're at such high concentrations or is specificity lost in these condensates when the concentrations are much higher than they are in the normal cytosol? And I haven't seen this really addressed and I don't know if it's because it's a very difficult question and it's not answerable or if it's just people haven't tried to get into it. I mean because there's a lot of what RNAs are in these granules because we don't know we might not be certain of what the function are and if we understand the components and how they get there that seems important. And people have tried to say oh we see these RNA binding proteins in there and that's why these RNAs are in there but it could be the opposite that the RNAs are in there and they're pulling their RNA binding proteins along for the ride. And I think we have this thinking of just like oh the RNA binding proteins are defining the specificity but that doesn't make a lot of sense once I feel like we start really getting into the concentrations within these granules. And again crowding versus concentration are kind of interrelated to me but this is something that comes up in my head that I haven't seen good experiments to try and disentangle these things of what's going on and how the chemistry changes in these condensates.",

            "transcript": "That's very interesting. So that connects on many levels I think to to what we're thinking about. We we're working on condensates in the cell nucleus specifically related to transcription. And you know this this whole idea that things just phase separate in the nucleus is obviously more complicated because many of the condensates are anchored to specific chromatin sites right so so there needs to be some cue to do it in that place and not elsewhere. And and transcription nascent transcripts might be one of those triggers. And that would be what causes the nucleation. The other thing that we're thinking about and and that's somewhat related to crowding maybe not is is the the scaffold structure that is underneath you know what what kind of chromatin structures impact on condensation. Is it is it something where we create a scaffold that favors nucleation? Is it something that excludes the volume which which creates a space for the condensate to form? Does it push out? And this is not exactly crowding questions per se but I think it's very closely related to that. And then you're talking about concentrations right so I just did the math because we have some of those quantitative imaging data and at least in the ballpark estimates we're actually in the hundreds of micromolar range sometimes with some of the the proteins and that's a thousandfold higher than the surrounding nucleoplasm which is obviously going to have a big effect.",

            "transcript": "I think this gets to a really interesting problem from our perspective building off of the nucleus which is how is molecular crowding as a event influenced how is it regulated in different subcellular compartments even in the from the nucleus to the ER right to the mitochondria there's crowding events that happen but they're differentially regulated and it seems like metabolism is a big part of that equation. And one thing that amazes me is you know you take proteins out of the cell and you put it in a test tube those things are sticky sticky sticky and fall out of solution and they're not happy but in the cell molecules like trehalose and glucose help maintain that solubility. And so you know how do you bridge that right? People can say we understand the effect of a crowding on protein structure and folding and I'm sure we do but is it the same thing that happens in the cell? I don't know. And I guess the other thing I would say is what is the consequence of molecular crowding dynamic molecular crowding regulatable molecular crowding on emergent properties like cellular mechanics? And that's where we get really excited because we think that there's a lot of room here to consider the impact of you know how does crowding and its tunability influence cellular viscoelasticity.",

I mean you have things kind of partitioning into these phase separated droplets whatever they are and that means that they are probably highly soluble at that and that actually then counteracts also a little bit the interactions because when you're surrounded by an environment where you really want to be in and that is kind of a little bit of a compensating effect for interactions between molecules in these these these compartments.",
