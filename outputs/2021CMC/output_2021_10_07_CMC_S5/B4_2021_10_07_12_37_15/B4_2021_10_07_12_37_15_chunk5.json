We we've taken obviously not everything that clusters is a condensate, right? So a fixed cell alone will will hide a lot of the dynamic information but what we have done in the past is is really quantitatively measure size distributions for example. If you have your very specific thermodynamic model of of how things nucleate and and grow and then disassemble again and you can measure a size distribution then the size distribution is very closely related to the free energy function. It's just probability is related to to free energy difference. So if you have this distribution then then can tell you something about mechanisms of how things nucleate and form and and disassemble again.",

And that you need different chemicals to be able to fix them properly versus the rest of the cytosol. Again it's just kind of a side thing that I agree that getting quantitative information is super important to understanding these things and there hasn't been enough of that but that it can be more difficult than just using the properties that people have used on normal fixation or normal chemistry because just again everything seems to be changing.",

I have a I actually have an unrelated question. I wonder whether any biochemical activities or cellular energy states that explain or contribute to the dynamics of the condensate because a lot of like a composition uh component protein component in the condensates are enzymes like ATPases uh enzymes. So no matter RNA drives the condensate or protein drives the condensate the RNA protein interaction definitely are in the condensates but those ATP-ase activity would uh change the equilibrium of the RNA protein interaction. So and that's correlated with the cellular state like uh younger people has more mitochondrial function than more senior people things like that. I wonder whether those biochemical activities underline some of dynamics of condensate and whether that's correlated with the cellular energy state. No idea on how to measure or technology development is just not my strength.",

Again whether that's conserved exactly what was driving it was unclear one paper was saying it's pH changes other was saying it's the ATP drop but it does seem like there are these enzymes that also condensate and whether it's related to the metabolic activity I think that's still unclear but that has been proposed I guess.",

So yeah I think no there's no definition and a lot of it has been very qualitative and so that's been a problem and I agree Mike Rosen and Roy Parker had this great P-body quantification paper and that was like one of the first I don't know there needs to be more of that because I think without quantification it is just very qualitative and again people are saying they're liquid-like they're gel-like they're all these things but without quantification it's uncertain.",
