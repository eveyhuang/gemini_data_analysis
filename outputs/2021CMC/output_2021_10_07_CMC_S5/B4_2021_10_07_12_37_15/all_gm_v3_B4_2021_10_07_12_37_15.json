These interactions are not necessarily strong, but they're not zero or repulsive either and how they can affect for example biomolecular assembly, the formation of complexes and everything is very densely packed.

A lot of these are RNA binding proteins and so they have some binding specificity and that might be on the nanomolar range but then in these condensates they're micromolar and so do they still maintain this specificity when they're at such high concentrations or is specificity lost in these condensates when the concentrations are much higher than they are in the normal cytosol? And I haven't seen this really addressed and I don't know if it's because it's a very difficult question and it's not answerable or if it's just people haven't tried to get into it. I mean because there's a lot of what RNAs are in these granules because we don't know we might not be certain of what the function are and if we understand the components and how they get there that seems important. And people have tried to say oh we see these RNA binding proteins in there and that's why these RNAs are in there but it could be the opposite that the RNAs are in there and they're pulling their RNA binding proteins along for the ride. And I think we have this thinking of just like oh the RNA binding proteins are defining the specificity but that doesn't make a lot of sense once I feel like we start really getting into the concentrations within these granules. And again crowding versus concentration are kind of interrelated to me but this is something that comes up in my head that I haven't seen good experiments to try and disentangle these things of what's going on and how the chemistry changes in these condensates.",

We we're working on condensates in the cell nucleus specifically related to transcription. And you know this this whole idea that things just phase separate in the nucleus is obviously more complicated because many of the condensates are anchored to specific chromatin sites right so so there needs to be some cue to do it in that place and not elsewhere. And and transcription nascent transcripts might be one of those triggers. And that would be what causes the nucleation. The other thing that we're thinking about and and that's somewhat related to crowding maybe not is is the the scaffold structure that is underneath you know what what kind of chromatin structures impact on condensation. Is it is it something where we create a scaffold that favors nucleation? Is it something that excludes the volume which which creates a space for the condensate to form? Does it push out? And this is not exactly crowding questions per se but I think it's very closely related to that. And then you're talking about concentrations right so I just did the math because we have some of those quantitative imaging data and at least in the ballpark estimates we're actually in the hundreds of micromolar range sometimes with some of the the proteins and that's a thousandfold higher than the surrounding nucleoplasm which is obviously going to have a big effect.",

And one thing that amazes me is you know you take proteins out of the cell and you put it in a test tube those things are sticky sticky sticky and fall out of solution and they're not happy but in the cell molecules like trehalose and glucose help maintain that solubility. And so you know how do you bridge that right? People can say we understand the effect of a crowding on protein structure and folding and I'm sure we do but is it the same thing that happens in the cell? I don't know. And I guess the other thing I would say is what is the consequence of molecular crowding dynamic molecular crowding regulatable molecular crowding on emergent properties like cellular mechanics? And that's where we get really excited because we think that there's a lot of room here to consider the impact of you know how does crowding and its tunability influence cellular viscoelasticity.",

So label one partner with one fluorophore and the other with another and monitor fret between them and we use temperature perturbations to get on and off rates as well as binding affinities and then mapping that to regions of the cell. So we see differences in affinity in vitro in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus and I do have some evidence for differences in droplets at least for motion into and out of the droplet at different temperatures. So it's something we can look at and we've built a three-color system to try and do assembly. But something I'm also interested is in the structure and the activity inside the droplets and so PFK for example is thought to form a filament structure and that's been seen in vitro but not in cells. So using infrared spectroscopy or infrared imaging we're hoping to look at the actual structure in in the droplets and then by using infrared labels in a region that is free of infrared modes monitor activity associated with those different structures. And then we use our perturbation techniques to cause phase separation to occur and look at changes in the activity. So we get kind of a spatial map of activity in the cell.",

But in a cell you're dealing with dozens of different components that are always there at different concentrations different modification states you have activity in there. So so I think that and we're seeing some some very promising results that that we will see much more complex morphologies maybe something like where an interface is actually important for for activity and and not just the bulk phase but the the edge or the the connection between different sub phases so to say which gives it some some sort of structural connection like maybe as you see in the nucleolus where you have the different layers and then you transition from one phase to the next to the next and they're all functionally connected and not just through some biophysical rules that create layers.",

So because it's you know looking at work like for example Fred Chang at UCSF has this beautiful I don't know if he got it published yet paper showing that by modulating the density of the cytoplasm you change the dynamics of microtubule polymerization in really interesting ways. And so the thing I'm really curious about is with big you know macro scale changes to molecular crowding you're changing so many different reactions simultaneously right? How does a cell deal with that? And one cool example is I think also Simon Alberti I can't remember who did this to be honest but people were looking at the diffusion just diffusion in the cytoplasm of particles under in yeast cells grown at different temperatures right? And Einstein-Boltzmann would say that that should cause diffusion to change in a temperature dependent way but they didn't see that. It looked like the diffusion remained constant across increasing temperature scales and that's how they ended up doing a screen and finding that look trehalose production goes through the roof and that's actually stabilizing diffusion so reactions don't go haywire. Anyway me on my soapbox.",
