So as far as I know there are no general rules to classify any of that. And it's very hard to study too like in simulations these systems are horrible.",

            "transcript": "And and I think it will become even more complicated and I mean Paul's question was what is a condensate is there a definition. I think it's probably very much in flux at this point what people describe as that and so one thing that that I'm really excited about is is that we're gearing up to do this kind of multiplexed imaging with very high resolution to really map out structures and and we all know that all these in vitro reconstructions use maybe two three components so that that very much limits how many phases you can observe. But in a cell you're dealing with dozens of different components that are always there at different concentrations different modification states you have activity in there. So so I think that and we're seeing some some very promising results that that we will see much more complex morphologies maybe something like where an interface is actually important for for activity and and not just the bulk phase but the the edge or the the connection between different sub phases so to say which gives it some some sort of structural connection like maybe as you see in the nucleolus where you have the different layers and then you transition from one phase to the next to the next and they're all functionally connected and not just through some biophysical rules that create layers.",

            "transcript": "So would the definition of a condensate just crudely be higher concentration than the global average? Again what that threshold is and how many by random chance you just have proteins that are higher concentration versus this is a true condensate I think is unclear but I think part of the problem was people called these like liquid like phase separation and that's condensates I think should be more encompassing and it's just higher concentrations right? Is that generally what we think condensates are?",

Definitely their size is not well defined.",

I mean a condensate if you FRAP it recovers pretty damn quick but if you FRAP like the lamina for example which I would call a molecular complex it doesn't. And so there are other ways. I guess the other thing I wanted to point out or maybe emphasize is it seems like you know condensates are the are a big topic right and they're only one part of molecular crowding. They're a very specialized part of molecular crowding.",

So because it's you know looking at work like for example Fred Chang at UCSF has this beautiful I don't know if he got it published yet paper showing that by modulating the density of the cytoplasm you change the dynamics of microtubule polymerization in really interesting ways. And so the thing I'm really curious about is with big you know macro scale changes to molecular crowding you're changing so many different reactions simultaneously right? How does a cell deal with that? And one cool example is I think also Simon Alberti I can't remember who did this to be honest but people were looking at the diffusion just diffusion in the cytoplasm of particles under in yeast cells grown at different temperatures right? And Einstein-Boltzmann would say that that should cause diffusion to change in a temperature dependent way but they didn't see that. It looked like the diffusion remained constant across increasing temperature scales and that's how they ended up doing a screen and finding that look trehalose production goes through the roof and that's actually stabilizing diffusion so reactions don't go haywire. Anyway me on my soapbox.",
