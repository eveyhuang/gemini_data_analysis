We can change temperature, but that's not just going to affect the condensate. We can change buffer conditions in the medium, but how does the whole cell respond to that as compared to just the condensate? So that becomes very difficult to disentangle.",

      "transcript": "I want to go back to Holly's points about synthetic creating synthetic structure using by exploiting phase separation. So one thing I've seen, there have been synthetic biology work that have exploited phase separation. I thought one thing that is my question is whether there are any design rules where you can use to a priori design and control and fine tune phase separation in terms of the time scale of the formation or dissociation and efficiency, specificity of reaction. And then any high throughput method to study that and then later also use machine learning to learn the rules. So that's what I thought maybe makes sense but you know, I'm not in the field, so maybe others can comment on that.",

      "transcript": "I guess it would be interesting in some of these synthetic systems to get back to the question we were talking about clustering and phase separation. Does it matter if you have very strong interactions but only a couple and cluster things together versus you have these multivalent weak interactions which to me is what differentiates a phase separation from a cluster. And so does that change if you're again if we go back to this metabolic activity and we're trying to make metabolic activity happen, if you force clustering by having single very strong interactions versus you can somehow make a lot of weak interactions, does that change the results of what you have? And I guess it probably depends on I guess how quickly you regenerate things because with the phase separation you're going to be molecules are going to be leaving the cluster and coming back versus a cluster they're kind of there for the long haul.",
