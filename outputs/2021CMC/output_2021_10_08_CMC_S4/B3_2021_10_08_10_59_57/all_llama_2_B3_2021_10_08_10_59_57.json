So so what we're thinking about is how do complex multi-phase assemblies arise from from complex systems that you have in the cell as compared to your simple reconstitution systems where you have maybe one, two, three components but in the cell you have dozens. So there are certainly many phases. You can think about material properties I would say. You can have several liquid phases that that coexist but that have different composition and are therefore different phases. But they can also have different material properties like more gel-like, more glass-like or liquid-like. Maybe at some point it transitions into a stable aggregate then the question is is that still what we're talking about or what do we not care about that because it is a stable assembly and there are no dynamics for example.",

And then that we talked about ATP, as long as the metabolite flux is there, that island stays intact but something just stops and then it dissipates.

But then when people have actually tried to go back and measure decapping, they don't see that. And then now there's kind of conflicting papers that if you do in vitro phase separation of the catalytic domain, you get no activity, but then maybe if you add in another protein, you get accelerated activity. So it seems very complicated and I don't know, I mean I think we need sensors of actual activity within that and not just these things whenever we measure separately they have activity and so this is what's happening inside the granule but better because I think in some cases it's going to be worse and in some cases it's going to be better, but I don't know if there's a hard and fast rule either direction.",

So I feel like in the field that's one thing that that that scientists struggle with is like annotating clear functions to being associated with these structures. So we really need new tools to like biosensors to address that.",

We really found that these genetic mutations, you know DNA sequences, when you have certain mutations, especially that happens a lot in these disease-causing regions, you have single nucleotide changes. That, in our current work, not totally done yet, but it looks like a big portion of those are really changing protein function through phase separation. Which is of course, very beginning of the whole field is not really much to do whatever. But actually genetic mutations, they change that, that also tells you that hey this is one of the reasons that can occur in the cell through either just accumulation of mutations. Recently, actually last week, I think we had there's a very interesting Nature paper that just came out saying that genetic mutation doesn't really happen just by cell division like what people think in the past. It can happen spontaneously, which is like totally new in the field. Which also tells you another reason for this thing to happen. If that is the case, there are also other ways for sure that can compensate, regulate, like what Seth was saying just now also is a positive regulation, negative regulation, all of those mechanisms too.",

We've hit this somewhat but there may be some other functions that people would like to come back to. And then and then also this very important point of how we can really study what's going on inside. So maybe even take a couple of minutes here to write down some of your thoughts on one or more of those points.

We're going to need to give Jan about 15 minutes to so we can help him extract some of the key points.

So you know one key thing that we have been really scratching our head is like how do you distinguish the colocalization from you know it's really a fusion, really a condensate from the just a simple imaging pictures like behind Gulcin I see that. So you know so how do you distinguish that? Apparently you you need a second alternative approach to validate hey this is not just simple colocalization, they have nothing to do with interacting or fusing to each other. I don't think we are fully you know we can fully really dissociate these two aspects yet. Even though there are additional efforts that people put in to study the physical biophysical properties of these condensates they have to have a what is that a circular shape seems like really a condensed kind of fused kind of liquid droplet. Sometimes also measure a few other kind of parameters if possible to demonstrate it's really a unit an entity over there. But I think it's a very good point.",

So it's certainly associated in a common entity but it's it's not a homogeneous phase. So so that description is is way too simple. And that's just looking at two components out of dozens.

But I think the one of the important things is that we need to define phase separation and we need to discuss how to describe it. We had some ideas. I think what we came up with is very general and vague. So it's probably not capturing everything that is going to happen. We brought up many big questions. I think we brought up more questions than answers which is I think okay. But half of the document that I typed up is the big questions, maybe a third or so is functions and and what we need to do next to address it. I think some recurring themes were what sets what determines multi-phase assemblies, how can we create different phases, and how can molecules transition between them and how do they behave differently in different condensate, different condensate context? Do they have different functions in different condensates? And how can we on the one hand use that, maybe rational design that for synthetic biology, but how can we also understand how that is used maybe in signal transduction to to speed up certain reactions or signaling pathways? Then one of the questions was how do we structure all these condensates that we see in the cell? Are there scaffolding structures like the cytoskeleton that play a role in in organizing where phase separation happens and also controls temporal scale of condensate formation and dissolution? What we didn't talk about is that we see the same thing in the cell nucleus where we have the the chromatin scaffold. So so maybe there's a unifying theme where we have some sort of scaffolding structure that helps control phase separation in biology.",

So you you get your rRNA produced in the center but then as they mature they go to the outer layers and have a higher affinity for some of those outer layers so so there is some sort of directional flow from one phase to another to another as you go undergo modification steps. I can't tell you exactly what the modifications are but you can maybe add a protein maybe you you recruit something maybe you change your structure in one phase but then the next phase becomes more attractive to you so so you get this kind of gradient.",
