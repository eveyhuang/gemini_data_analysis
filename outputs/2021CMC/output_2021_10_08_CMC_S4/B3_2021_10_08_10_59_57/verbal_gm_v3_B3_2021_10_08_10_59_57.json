So so what we're thinking about is how do complex multi-phase assemblies arise from from complex systems that you have in the cell as compared to your simple reconstitution systems where you have maybe one, two, three components but in the cell you have dozens. So there are certainly many phases. You can think about material properties I would say. You can have several liquid phases that that coexist but that have different composition and are therefore different phases. But they can also have different material properties like more gel-like, more glass-like or liquid-like.

But then when people have actually tried to go back and measure decapping, they don't see that.

That, in our current work, not totally done yet, but it looks like a big portion of those are really changing protein function through phase separation. Which is of course, very beginning of the whole field is not really much to do whatever. But actually genetic mutations, they change that, that also tells you that hey this is one of the reasons that can occur in the cell through either just accumulation of mutations. Recently, actually last week, I think we had there's a very interesting Nature paper that just came out saying that genetic mutation doesn't really happen just by cell division like what people think in the past. It can happen spontaneously, which is like totally new in the field. Which also tells you another reason for this thing to happen. If that is the case, there are also other ways for sure that can compensate, regulate, like what Seth was saying just now also is a positive regulation, negative regulation, all of those mechanisms too.

I think what we came up with is very general and vague. So it's probably not capturing everything that is going to happen. We brought up many big questions. I think we brought up more questions than answers which is I think okay. But half of the document that I typed up is the big questions, maybe a third or so is functions and and what we need to do next to address it. I think some recurring themes were what sets what determines multi-phase assemblies, how can we create different phases, and how can molecules transition between them and how do they behave differently in different condensate, different condensate context? Do they have different functions in different condensates? And how can we on the one hand use that, maybe rational design that for synthetic biology, but how can we also understand how that is used maybe in signal transduction to to speed up certain reactions or signaling pathways? Then one of the questions was how do we structure all these condensates that we see in the cell? Are there scaffolding structures like the cytoskeleton that play a role in in organizing where phase separation happens and also controls temporal scale of condensate formation and dissolution? What we didn't talk about is that we see the same thing in the cell nucleus where we have the the chromatin scaffold. So so maybe there's a unifying theme where we have some sort of scaffolding structure that helps control phase separation in biology. ",
