We can change temperature, but that's not just going to affect the condensate. We can change buffer conditions in the medium, but how does the whole cell respond to that as compared to just the condensate? So that becomes very difficult to disentangle.",

So one thing I've seen, there have been synthetic biology work that have exploited phase separation. I thought one thing that my question is whether there are any design rules where you can use to a priori design and control and fine tune phase separation in terms of the time scale of the formation or dissociation and efficiency, specificity of reaction. And then any high throughput method to study that and then later also use machine learning to learn the rules. So that's what I thought maybe missing but I'm not in the field so maybe others can comment on that.",

Does it matter if you have very strong interactions but only a couple and cluster things together versus you have these multivalent weak interactions which to me is what differentiates a phase separation from a cluster. And so does that change if you're again if we go back to this metabolic activity and we're trying to make metabolic activity happen, if you force clustering by having single very strong interactions versus you can somehow make a lot of weak interactions, does that change the results of what you have? And I guess you're it probably depends on I guess how quickly you regenerate things because with the phase separation you're going to be molecules are going to be leaving the cluster and coming back versus a cluster they're kind of there for the long haul.",

But I think the one of the important things is that we need to define phase separation and we need to discuss how to describe it. We had some ideas. I think what we came up with is very general and vague. So it's probably not capturing everything that is going to happen. We brought up many big questions. I think we brought up more questions than answers which is I think okay. But half of the document that I typed up is the big questions, maybe a third or so is functions and and what we need to do next to address it. I think some recurring themes were what sets what determines multi-phase assemblies, how can we create different phases, and how can molecules transition between them and how do they behave differently in different condensate, different condensate context? Do they have different functions in different condensates? And how can we on the one hand use that, maybe rational design that for synthetic biology, but how can we also understand how that is used maybe in signal transduction to to speed up certain reactions or signaling pathways? Then one of the questions was how do we structure all these condensates that we see in the cell? Are there scaffolding structures like the cytoskeleton that play a role in in organizing where phase separation happens and also controls temporal scale of condensate formation and dissolution? What we didn't talk about is that we see the same thing in the cell nucleus where we have the the chromatin scaffold. So so maybe there's a unifying theme where we have some sort of scaffolding structure that helps control phase separation in biology.",
