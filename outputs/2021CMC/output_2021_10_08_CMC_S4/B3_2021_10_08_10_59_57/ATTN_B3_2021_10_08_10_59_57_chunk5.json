      "transcript": "Yeah so that's a very that's a very kind of a complex and still kind of open question in biology especially. Some of the proteins or genes that are present in different protein complexes right and they are potentially they are in different condensates. In one context you know as you mentioned or expected it could be carrying out one function function one and then in another complex the same protein is participating in a different complex a different condensate and doing a different function. So you know how that is regulated is that time or that concentration time scale back to Jan's point earlier and Cheemeng's question on the spatial scale and all of that too. I think all of this is is really important to really regulate them you know same sort of protein you are taking two roles.",

Can we think that cytoskeleton is the master regulators for the condensate organization or maybe it's just like now we know we know more about these circulating actin network actin oscillations and similar things for microtubule growth and microtubule dynamics right. What if these things are kind of organized and oscillated through the cytoskeletal networks and it's almost like a heartbeat right they're kind of passing.",

You know there's there's definitely not a homogeneous cytoplasm in the cell. So there is a chemical gradient from one part again so depends on where the protein is generated. From that source maybe that's the highest concentration and then it diffuses physics chemistry and then along that gradient that also guided certain condensate to go where they want to be.",

      "transcript": "I want to add on Gulcin's points. now that I think about it seems interesting because phase separation is supposed to be dynamic but what is controlling the time scale of this phase separation such that each process is optimized right. If we believe life is optimized through evolution then the time scale of this phase separated entity in each type of the process should be optimized. Then then that get back to some high level idea of whether there is this frequency is it a frequency control process where the frequency of the the the oscillation or pulses of this formation of the phase separation is synchronized or optimized. And maybe that's all depend on the master clock of say the the chemical condition of the cell or crowding level of the cell that that control this pulses of phase separation. Just a random thought.",

So you know small small oligomers first phase separating as a protein droplet that then acts as nucleation sites for amyloid and I think unless familiar but I think there's there's also been some roles identified in actin assembly.",

      "transcript": "Yes yeah definitely there have been and on a related idea the microtubule the centrosome seems to be a phase separated structure and there's some evidence that force okay so that that both the phase separated structures can both create force which is similar to say microtubule or actin polymerization but also can resist force. So there's some of the idea that phase separation may be important for attaching the kinetochore. So so so I guess yeah that's a one additional thing to be mentioned is the ability to either create or withstand force. So other other ideas about the function.",

So if we need to think about or envision the function of phase separation I feel like it it requires a clear definition of what is a phase separation right. kind of I think the the process seems to to be very similar with the history of the understanding of the membrane membrane domains membrane rafts right. So so I think you know in my opinion I I I have this question in the back of my my mind how is phase separation different from just local clustering of molecules?",

      "transcript": "Yeah I would I would second that. So I had that question I wrote down earlier like at the beginning as Holly was mentioning that too. So you know one key thing that we have been really scratching our head is like how do you distinguish the colocalization from you know it's really a fusion really a condensate from from the just a simple image you know imaging pictures like behind Gulcin I see that. So you know so how do you distinguish that apparently you you need a second alternative approach to validate hey this is not just simple colocalization they have nothing to do with interaction or fusing to each other. I don't think we are fully you know we can fully really dissociate these two aspects yet even though there are additional efforts that people put in to study the physical biophysical properties of these condensates they have to have a what is that a circular shape seems like really a condensed kind of fused kind of liquid droplet. sometimes also measure a few other kind of parameters if possible to demonstrate it's really a unit an entity over there. But I think it's a very good point.",
