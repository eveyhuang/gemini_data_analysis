            "transcript": "scaffold is destroyed, you lose a part and become separated. So, part of that, back to Brian's point just now, yes, one part of the game is that you increase its specificity. You have the certain signaling molecule pathways dedicated to certain functions moving forward. The other aspect of it is that the scaffold part or condensed part itself is greatly increased the efficiency of that signal transduction at that local area as well. So I think these things can be a balance and then that's actually part of the game that I think that the signal can be regulated better.",

            "transcript": "I mean kind of going back to metabolism, I like that idea using maybe condensate to regulate the reaction rates. Right? So if you if you, let's say I'm thinking about neurons, metabolism has to respond really really fast. We're talking about milliseconds. And the reaction rate cannot be relying on new protein or it could be it could be maybe the enzymes are there but what's regulating the rate whether you condensate these enzymes to inactivate or kind of spread to change the equilibrium state and it's it's another way to gate signaling pathways. So it's not only about efficiency within the condensate but also kind of controlling the pathways by forming. So I like that idea a lot, I think, especially for metabolic regulation.",

            "transcript": "Do we have a sense and I think some of these haven't been measured that well of is the general trend that when you throw a bunch of enzymes together they work better or they work worse? I mean so some of these things like a lot of these functions that they've ascribed to some of these granules is just like for P-body processing bodies where you have these decapping enzymes, they're like, oh, RNA degradation is happening in there because you're concentrating all these RNA decapping enzymes. But then when people have actually tried to go back and measure decapping, they don't see that. And then now there's kind of conflicting papers that if you do in vitro phase separation of the catalytic domain, you get no activity, but then maybe if you add in another protein, you get accelerated activity. So it seems very complicated and I don't know, I mean I think we need sensors of actual activity within that and not just these things whenever we measure separately they have activity and so this is what's happening inside the granule but better because I think in some cases it's going to be worse and in some cases it's going to be better, but I don't know if there's a hard and fast rule either direction.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, this I really like this point Brian just brought up about essentially like so enzymes get recruited to these structures. So what, how does it affect their function? We really need biosensors to report on that because I think Brian's right, it could go either way. It could down-regulate the activity, do nothing, or up-regulate the activity. So I feel like in the field that's one thing that that that scientists struggle with is like annotating clear functions to being associated with these structures. So we really need new tools to like biosensors to address that.",

            "transcript": "The other point I really want to bring up because I, that's actually a little bit focus of my lab's work. We really found that these genetic mutations, you know DNA sequences, when you have certain mutations, especially that happens a lot in these disease-causing regions, you have single nucleotide changes. That, in our current work, not totally done yet, but it looks like a big portion of those are really changing protein function through phase separation. Which is of course, very beginning of the whole field is not really much to do whatever. But actually genetic mutations, they change that, that also tells you that hey this is one of the reasons that can occur in the cell through either just accumulation of mutations. Recently, actually last week, I think we had there's a very interesting Nature paper that just came out saying that genetic mutation doesn't really happen just by cell division like what people think in the past. It can happen spontaneously, which is like totally new in the field. Which also tells you another reason for this thing to happen. If that is the case, there are also other ways for sure that can compensate, regulate, like what Seth was saying just now also is a positive regulation, negative regulation, all of those mechanisms too.",

            "transcript": "So maybe this would be a good time to start thinking about what might what how might we be able to harness phase separation. I guess I did want to though before we have people comment on on that, two other things to be thinking about are are first, what are the the functions of it? We've hit this somewhat but there may be some other functions that people would like to come back to. And then and then also this very important point of how we can really study what's going on inside. So maybe even take a couple of minutes here to write down some of your thoughts on one or more of those points. Just so you know also time-wise, we've got about 20-ish minutes left before we're going to need to start kind of wrapping things up. We're going to need to give Jan about 15 minutes to so we can help him extract some of the key points. Okay, so maybe one way to proceed here then would be to just to see if we can summarize what either established or or known or proposed functions are for phase separation. Anybody want to just go ahead and start?",

            "transcript": "Yeah I think going back to to some of the discussions that we just had about efficiency. I think in the in the case of transcription regulation there is evidence that condensates makes the process more efficient. On the one hand in the cells we find condensates at very highly expressed gene loci. The the evidence is not so strong that that's this is really driving a specific gene. In the cell I think there's still lacking knowledge but at the same time there are also in vitro studies for say in vitro transcription reaction where if you induce the the capability to form condensates in your little in vitro transcription reaction you can make it more efficient you produce more product with the same input reagents.",

            "transcript": "I mean they also serve as a way to segment the cytosol or segment different parts of the cell. In stress response, you might have a bunch of RNAs that are present that were non-stress RNAs and it might take more time to degrade them or you don't know how quickly the cell's going to get back out of the stress. So you can separate a certain amount of RNAs away from the translational machinery so that you can spend more resources towards translating the RNAs. So I think just it can help segment the cell in a non-membrane this way.",

So it's pretty much like little buses, you are taking each school bus has a set of people who are going to kindergarten, grade one. So I think this part is very interesting that because intracellular trafficking is very important for many many activities like enzyme activity, signal transduction, especially in neuroscience you have signal transduction involving peptides, neuropeptides and other neurotransmitters, very important to have that protected environment for transport.",
