Like is that kind of how we would if we were trying to define it, is that are there other things beyond that? I know we brought up temperature and pH and all these other things.

So you have any time you have a situation where the components are separating themselves from the surrounding environment, that is a sign of this. And then when you try to push is it really a phase separation or some other type of I think that the key thing here is liquid liquid phase separation versus say solid liquid phase separation, right? And so in the liquid there is which clearly has a defined meaning in physics, there's going to be a movement of the molecules relative to each other. But other people may have other things to say.

Like kind of practically like we're faced with this decision when when one constructs a phase diagram and they symbolically decide this is phase separated, this is not, you have to make these cutoffs of exactly like, you know, number of molecules in here or partitioning ratio or size or dynamics. So you're you're forced to make a cutoff at that at that point when you're, you know, portraying your data or visualizing it in a phase diagram. And then I agree like things like pH and salt and temperature are kind of diagnostic but they're not all or none definitions for it being phase separated or not.",

And potentially dynamics is seems like I guess is that true? Sorry to be so contrary.
