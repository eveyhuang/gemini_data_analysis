So so what we're thinking about is how do complex multi-phase assemblies arise from from complex systems that you have in the cell as compared to your simple reconstitution systems where you have maybe one, two, three components but in the cell you have dozens. So there are certainly many phases. You can think about material properties I would say. You can have several liquid phases that that coexist but that have different composition and are therefore different phases. But they can also have different material properties like more gel-like, more glass-like or liquid-like.

But then when people have actually tried to go back and measure decapping, they don't see that. And then now there's kind of conflicting papers that if you do in vitro phase separation of the catalytic domain, you get no activity, but then maybe if you add in another protein, you get accelerated activity. So it seems very complicated and I don't know, I mean I think we need sensors of actual activity within that and not just these things whenever we measure separately they have activity and so this is what's happening inside the granule but better because I think in some cases it's going to be worse and in some cases it's going to be better, but I don't know if there's a hard and fast rule either direction.

That, in our current work, not totally done yet, but it looks like a big portion of those are really changing protein function through phase separation. Which is of course, very beginning of the whole field is not really much to do whatever. But actually genetic mutations, they change that, that also tells you that hey this is one of the reasons that can occur in the cell through either just accumulation of mutations. Recently, actually last week, I think we had there's a very interesting Nature paper that just came out saying that genetic mutation doesn't really happen just by cell division like what people think in the past. It can happen spontaneously, which is like totally new in the field. Which also tells you another reason for this thing to happen.

Does it matter if you have very strong interactions but only a couple and cluster things together versus you have these multivalent weak interactions which to me is what differentiates a phase separation from a cluster. And so does that change if you're again if we go back to this metabolic activity and we're trying to make metabolic activity happen, if you force clustering by having single very strong interactions versus you can somehow make a lot of weak interactions, does that change the results of what you have? And I guess you're it probably depends on I guess how quickly you regenerate things because with the phase separation you're going to be molecules are going to be leaving the cluster and coming back versus a cluster they're kind of there for the long haul.

I think what we came up with is very general and vague. So it's probably not capturing everything that is going to happen. We brought up many big questions. I think we brought up more questions than answers which is I think okay. But half of the document that I typed up is the big questions, maybe a third or so is functions and and what we need to do next to address it. I think some recurring themes were what sets what determines multi-phase assemblies, how can we create different phases, and how can molecules transition between them and how do they behave differently in different condensate, different condensate context? Do they have different functions in different condensates? And how can we on the one hand use that, maybe rational design that for synthetic biology, but how can we also understand how that is used maybe in signal transduction to to speed up certain reactions or signaling pathways? Then one of the questions was how do we structure all these condensates that we see in the cell? Are there scaffolding structures like the cytoskeleton that play a role in in organizing where phase separation happens and also controls temporal scale of condensate formation and dissolution? What we didn't talk about is that we see the same thing in the cell nucleus where we have the the chromatin scaffold. So so maybe there's a unifying theme where we have some sort of scaffolding structure that helps control phase separation in biology. ",

And I don't know how to do I've kind of looked at like how people purify proteins and the tags they put on there and if you could just add something like that to an RNA would that keep it out of the granule? I never did this experimentally but I just kind of throwing ideas out there that it seems like we're very focused on getting things in but it would also be cool to keep some things out. ",
