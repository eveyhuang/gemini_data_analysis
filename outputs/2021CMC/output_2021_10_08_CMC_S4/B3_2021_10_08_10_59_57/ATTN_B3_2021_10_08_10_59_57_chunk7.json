People define the lipid raft a lot, right, there's a very clear definition for some to some extent, but the detection of the lipid raft kind of prevents the establishment of that definition.",

      "transcript": "We would say that we could we did have perfect quantification of everything. Would it be some what would it be some concentration above some threshold along with dynamics above some threshold or would it be beyond that? I guess if we could theoretically quantify these things. So does it need to be a size? We're saying no. Or does it need to be above five molecules and then above twofold above concentration and then some dynamics where it exchanges so often? Is that kind of how we would if we were trying to define it? Is that are there other things beyond that? I know we brought up temperature and pH and all these other things. Would that be in the definition or would it be just much more about measuring concentration dynamics things like that?",
