            "transcript": "Actually I think that's a very interesting question and that may also go back to this energy thing, right? If you think of things that just polymerize or assemble in a equilibrium way, it tends to be kind of slow to respond, but the steady state ones can be very quick. And it's an interesting question if one might be able to identify the situations where there's energy involved by seeing things that do respond very quickly. Other other comments either on that or or other questions that people had?",

            "transcript": "Yeah, this this is maybe a naive question because I'm not working in this field but so we had before protein-protein interactions, right? And then we said like a protein binds to each other and then I guess now if we start thinking about metabolic reactions, enzyme proteins plus metabolites, then can we think about phase separation as almost like metabolic islands, right? So and then you have like multiple islands and they're kind of doing their own thing, they're they're not a network. And then that we talked about ATP, as long as the metabolite flux is there, that island stays intact but something just stops and then it dissipates. And then what brings these phase separated, we were talking about how many phases, maybe what keeps them separate or what defines them is this the metabolite cloud in the cytoplasm. Can we think about it like that or am I being too I don't know naive or ATP-centric because of my mitochondrial vision?",
