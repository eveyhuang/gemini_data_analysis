It would be helpful to really have that so we can actually start thinking about function of phase separated assemblies. One idea that came up is can we generate a scenario where we compare one process and in the one scenario it depends on stable, strongly interacting accumulations of molecules versus weakly interacting condensate phases.",

I would really like some way to keep an RNA out of a phase separated condensate that's not a ribosome to test like function because we always look at function inside there but if I kept an RNA outside the granule will it translate now? And I don't know how to do I've kind of looked at like how people purify proteins and the tags they put on there and if you could just add something like that to an RNA would that keep it out of the granule? I never did this experimentally but I just kind of throwing ideas out there that it seems like we're very focused on getting things in but it would also be cool to keep some things out.",

Like in some of the bacterial proteins unstructured RNAs readily associate but but structured ones don't. And so there there's been some work I think like Alex Green who's here had engineered degradation controlling tags which are basically like hairpins into the RNA and I wonder if that also regulates their entry into these structures.",

So I don't I think we don't know the rules of what RNAs are going in there and which ones are not. So I would not be surprised if there is some RNA structure as well. In general it seems like free RNAs go in there but I I'm sure there's more rules beyond that. I just don't know if we have enough data to figure out what those rules are yet.

So you you get your rRNA produced in the center but then as they mature they go to the outer layers and have a higher affinity for some of those outer layers so so there is some sort of directional flow from one phase to another to another as you go undergo modification steps. I can't tell you exactly what the modifications are but you can maybe add a protein maybe you you recruit something maybe you change your structure in one phase but then the next phase becomes more attractive to you so so you get this kind of gradient.",
