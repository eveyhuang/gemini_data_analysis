What like how many phases and how do we define that? And what distinguishes one phase from another? Are there any classifications in the field? We talked about",

So what we're I think starting to see or going to start seeing is that there is so much complexity in this whole phase separation field. It's not just a liquid and a liquid. So so what we're thinking about is how do complex multi-phase assemblies arise from from complex systems that you have in the cell as compared to your simple reconstitution systems where you have maybe one, two, three components but in the cell you have dozens. So there are certainly many phases. You can think about material properties I would say. You can have several liquid phases that that coexist but that have different composition and are therefore different phases. But they can also have different material properties like more gel-like, more glass-like or liquid-like. Maybe at some point it transitions into a stable aggregate then the question is is that still what we're talking about or what do we not care about that because it is a stable assembly and there are no dynamics for example.",

So if you have a biomolecular condensate that's involved in RNA biochemistry versus one that's involved in metabolism or different cellular processes like what if you look at those sequences what about them causes them to to phase separate from one another or to demix into distinct states. I feel like understanding those rules will be important moving forward.",

We we have investigated one system in the past where we were able to describe a very simple free energy function just say we have a a bulk term and a surface term and from that we can derive a condensate size distribution. And really just those two terms so just two constants, two interaction energies that describe the distribution of condensate sizes that we find. But I don't think that's going to be universally true. I think in most scenarios it's probably going to be more complex than that. That's at least my take.",

Does anybody have any information on that one? I I'm quite curious about that. Again working on the cytoskeleton right things like microtubules need energy to be polymerized and I'm wondering if there are any of these phase separated structures that are similarly energy utilizing.",

It's a CTPase so its ability to bind to DNA and then subsequently spread is dependent upon CTP hydrolysis. And then this is I don't know if you classify this as energy but it's sort of fuel-like in that the degradosome which which forms the bacterial degradosome RNC it it forms phase separated structures in bacteria that are dependent upon RNA. So when substrate's there it forms a condensate when it consumes the substrate those condensates dissolve. So if you call that energy but it's requires input.",

            "transcript": "I guess a question that I had is to me a lot of this formation of condensates makes sense because again like if you have usually RNAs are covered with ribosomes plowing through and then you have stress and you have these free RNAs and so now you have these multivalent substrates for things to bind but then the dissolution doesn't seem like that seems much harder and I'm wondering how much more energy comes in and I know that a lot of ATPases are important for the dissolution of these granules and so I wonder if the dissolution might be you need more energy going in than the formation which is energetically favorable. Because you can't just get ribosomes in there to start translating and kicking things off.",

The the condensates that we're thinking about are related to transcription and of course there's chromatin everywhere and you have active chromatin remodeling motors or enzymes ATP consuming proteins but when you delete some of them some of these condensates seem to collapse into into larger structures. So the activity might again be something that that pulls them apart or creates separation, fission, whatever it is.",
