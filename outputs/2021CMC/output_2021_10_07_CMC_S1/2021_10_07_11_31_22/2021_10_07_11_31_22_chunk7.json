But people were looking at the diffusion, just diffusion in the cytoplasm of particles under in yeast cells grown at different temperatures, right? And Einstein-Boltzmann would say that that should cause diffusion to change in a temperature-dependent way, but they didn't see that. It looked like the diffusion remained constant across increasing temperature scales. And that's how they ended up doing a screen and finding that look, trehalose production goes through the roof and that's actually stabilizing diffusion so reactions don't go haywire. Anyway, me on my soapbox.",

It's a very crowded environment and how does the cell counteract this crowding? What are the mechanisms that it's using to check, like proofreading type of things but for self-self and like to get it to the right place? And are there kind of general philosophies or general mechanisms that the cell uses to get around such a crowded environment in making sure that things are going to the right place, that the right interactions are taking place?
