            "transcript": "very difficult question and it's not answerable or if it's just people haven't tried to get into it. I mean because there's a lot of what RNAs are in these granules because we don't know we might not be certain about what the function are and if we understand the components and how they get there that seems important. And people have tried to say oh we see these RNA binding proteins in there and that's why these RNAs are in there but it could be the opposite that the RNAs are in there and they're pulling their RNA binding proteins along for the ride. And I think we have this thinking of just like oh the RNA binding proteins are defining the specificity but that doesn't make a lot of sense once I feel like we start really getting into the concentrations within these granules. And again I don't crowding versus concentration are kind of interrelated to me but this is something that comes up in my head that I haven't seen good experiments to try and disentangle these things of what's going on and how the chemistry changes in these condensates.",

            "transcript": "That's very interesting so that that connects on many levels I think to to what we're thinking about. We're we're working on condensates in the cell nucleus specifically related to transcription and you know this this whole idea that things just phase separate in the nucleus is obviously more complicated because many of the condensates are anchored to specific chromatin sites right so so there needs to be some cue to do it in that place and and not elsewhere. And and transcription nascent transcripts might be one of those triggers. I don't know that would be what causes the the nucleation. The other thing that we're thinking about is and and that's somewhat related to crowding maybe not is is the the scaffold structure that is underneath you know what what kind of chromatin structures impact on condensation is it is it something where we create a scaffold that favors nucleation is it something that the exclusive volume which which creates a space for the condensate to form there's a push out. I this is not exactly crowding questions per se but I think it's very closely related to that. And then you're talking about concentrations right so I just did the math because we have some of those quantitative imaging data and at least in the ballpark estimates we're actually in the hundreds of micromolar range sometimes for some of the the proteins and that's a thousandfold higher than the surrounding nucleoplasm which is obviously going to have a big effect.",

            "transcript": "I think this gets to a really interesting problem from our perspective building off of the nucleus which is you know how is molecular crowding as a event influenced how is it regulated in different subcellular compartments even in the from the nucleus to the ER right to the mitochondria there's crowding events that happen but they're differentially regulated and it seems like metabolism is a big part of that equation. And one thing that amazes me is you know you take proteins out of the cell you put it in a test tube those things are sticky sticky sticky and fall out of solution and they're not happy but in the cell molecules like trehalose and glucose help maintain that solubility. And so you know how do you bridge that right? People can say we understand the effect of a crowding on protein structure and folding and I'm sure we do but is it the same thing that happens in the cell? You know I don't know. And I guess the other thing I would say is what is the consequence of molecular crowding dynamic molecular crowding regulatable molecular crowding on emergent properties like cellular mechanics. And that's where we get really excited because we think that there's a lot of room here to consider the impact of you know how does crowding and its tunability influence cellular viscoelasticity.",

I had this thing that I wanted to say that made a lot of sense to me and then all of a sudden it went away I don't know what happened. Oh I remember. So crowding at different scales too right? We have crowding events that'll happen at the nano scale but then you get crowding events that happen at the meso scale from things like ribosomes and chromatin. Are they playing by the same rules?",

You see for that's why I nodded a lot when I heard the ribosome. A lot of ribosome modifications unlike messenger RNA modifications which are at low stoichiometry ribosome modifications are at nearly 100% is evolutionarily conserved. And but if you do an in vitro reaction it's very hard to get to 100% modified no matter how hard you try. In cells in the nucleolus is always 100%. So I'm really curious about how those condensation state whether and how it promotes the biogenesis and the function of ribosome modifications and whether is similarly or differently regulated as a chromatin state modifications.",

And you know this could you know in some some of the work that we're doing on this some has to do with with you know surface protein reorganization and so and we're also interested in doing this in the context of the epigenome and so you end up with really very variable time scales you know you could you could have you know you have to wait a really long time or you might just by chance you know not have to wait very long for these things to happen and so I guess back to Judith's question about measurements it's like the dynamics of that seems very very difficult to measure to actually sort of get a grip on sort of this very dynamic process of of you know things are crowded yes but they're also transiently you know uncrowded right and so so how do you actually get a grip on those dynamic processes.",
