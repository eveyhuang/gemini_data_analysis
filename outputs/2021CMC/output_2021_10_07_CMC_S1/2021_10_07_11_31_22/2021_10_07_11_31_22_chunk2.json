And related to that is how you actually measure it. That is in my case I do a lot of fluorescence and so the idea is to get a fluorophore that's small enough in general that can go through the cell membrane so you can label a native biomolecule and and have decent signal to noise.",

So crowding stabilizes proteins it stabilizes binding interactions and and so from that perspective for from a well-structured protein we can make pretty good predictions but what we don't understand is how the other parts of the environment are affecting the stability of proteins or predicting how like non-steric interactions are affecting the protein interactions.
