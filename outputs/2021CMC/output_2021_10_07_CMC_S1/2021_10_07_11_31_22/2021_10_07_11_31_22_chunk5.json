So azide and alkyne labels but they have a vibrational mode in a region of the infrared where nothing absorbs so we can use them to monitor dynamics in in cells and this could also be useful for NMR. Also you know heavy isotopes have a unique vibrational mode so if you feed a cell glucose for example you can monitor incorporation of the C13 labels so I think these kind of approaches could be very complementary to mass spectrometry approaches that have been well developed.",

But eventually it would be nice to improve these kinds of approaches. But just overexpressing a protein in a cell versus a normal cell we can see the signal for that protein and it's unique and different from the background signal and then by inducing stress we see a shift in that peak associated with the protein. So I think that there is some promise and this is label-free measurements but then once you insert a probe at a specific position you can ask questions about what's happening at the single residue level which starts to get to what Matthias was mentioning you know like we want to know structurally what's going on not just kind of big big picture.",

And I guess like you know arguably right I mean you know any any you know I guess you know the the kind of the side question of that is whether or not um sort of in order to kind of infer uh kind of you know the that kind of short time scale information from from ensemble averages of particles whether or not we would have to have a very clear understanding of sort of the you know the the actual kind of non-equilibrium physics of of um of of condensate formation and um or or or whether or not there's you know there's something maybe you know a little bit more zero knowledge that um that we can we could use to to make that inference.",

We we've taken obviously not everything that clusters is a condensate right so a fixed cell alone will will hide a lot of the dynamic information but um what we have done in the past is is really quantitatively measure size distributions for example. Um if you have your very specific thermodynamic model of of how things nucleate and and grow and then disassemble again and you can measure a size distribution then the size distribution is very closely related to the free energy function right it's just probability is related to to free energy difference and so if you have this distribution um then then can tell you something about mechanisms um of how things nucleate and form and and disassemble again.",

Um and that you need different chemicals to be able to fix them properly versus the rest of the cytosol. Um again it's just kind of a side thing that fix I I agree that getting quantitative information um is super important to understanding these things and there hasn't been enough of that um but that it can be more difficult than just using the properties that people have used on normal fixation or normal chemistry because just again everything seems to be changing.",
