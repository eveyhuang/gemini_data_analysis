So phase imaging phase contrast imaging you guys have all used I'm sure where you have a little donut of a thing that blocks some wavelengths and you get constructive and deconstructive interference based on how light interacts with your sample and you get contrast that way. Well you can actually quantify some of you can quantify a lot from phase contrast and those quantifications seem to be reflecting back on how dense the cytoplasm is for example. But the problem with these techniques is they all seem to work pretty well on the single cell level on a glass cover slip but applying it to actual tissues or organisms is where the challenge really becomes apparent.",

            "transcript": "So I agree with what Gant said that these techniques provide you access to mechanical properties of a of an intracellular medium essentially but it's been pretty hard to backtrack these overall properties to individual interactions between molecules like what what is actually happening there. So often computer simulations try to help on one much much smaller scale this is something I did in the past for proteins. Like a very cool experiment that I kind of envision I'm not doing experiments so I'm completely dreaming here but Caitlin maybe this is something that you can do but I don't know I'm really spitballing. But you can track interactions between proteins using FRET and there has been some very cool research to do that in basically a microscope where you follow the FRET signals you can even resolve that spatially and you can see dynamics you can see things folding opening closing falling apart and if you can do that with multiple FRET pairs at the same time you can kind of see things moving out of the way so that something else can actually interact with something. So very often we we we think of these things in terms of how does molecule A and molecule B interact and how does it bind but we don't think about okay how does molecule C interfere with that how does it move out of the way and for that interactions of C and B and C and A of course are also important. But if you have multiple FRET pairs that you can monitor all at the same time in different channels you may be able to kind of disentangle that and then actually explain some of the more general mechanical properties that you can observe. That would be fantastic. Tall order.",

            "transcript": "So we have a microscope where we've monitored protein RNA binding partners who are part of the spliceosome and we we can do exactly what you describe. So label one partner with one fluorophore and the other with another and monitor FRET between them and we use temperature perturbations to get on and off rates as well as binding affinities and then mapping that to regions of the cell so we see differences in affinity in vitro in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus and I do have some evidence for differences in droplets at least for motion into and out of the droplet at different temperatures. So it's something we can look at and we've built a three color system to try and do assembly. But something I'm also interested in is the structure and the activity inside the droplets and so PFK for example is thought to form a filament structure and that's been seen in vitro but not in cells. So using infrared spectroscopy or infrared imaging we're hoping to look at the actual structure in in the droplets and then by using infrared labels in a region that is free of infrared modes monitor activity associated with those different structures. And then we use our perturbation techniques to cause phase separation to occur and look at changes in the activity. So we get kind of a spatial map of activity in the cell.",

So I think three is is a reasonable goal for us right now but then by moving the third probe you can map everything together. So keep two the same and move the third and then in the end you can overlay everything. Then in the infrared you're unlimited in your probes right because you know we have basically two million vibrational spectra from 800 wave numbers out to 2000 wave numbers. So if we can create a unique probe we can use that to monitor activity in the cell and they can be much smaller than our fluorescence probes.",

You express these genetically in your cells and then do single particle tracking on them and you can do then mean squared displacements and all sorts of microrheology tricks to figure out crowding at different length scales. But I think the thing that's really important to point out is like you guys were just mentioning Matthias and Caitlin there are specific probes for looking at specific interactions and how they're influenced by crowding then there are non-specific probes that look at you know general crowding.",
