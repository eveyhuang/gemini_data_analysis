And and transcription nascent transcripts might be one of those triggers. I don't know that would be what causes the the nucleation. The other thing that we're thinking about is and and that's somewhat related to crowding maybe not is is the the scaffold structure that is underneath you know what what kind of chromatin structures impact on condensation is it is it something where we create a scaffold that favors nucleation is it something that the exclusive volume which which creates a space for the condensate to form there's a push out. I this is not exactly crowding questions per se but I think it's very closely related to that. And then you're talking about concentrations right so I just did the math because we have some of those quantitative imaging data and at least in the ballpark estimates we're actually in the hundreds of micromolar range sometimes for some of the the proteins and that's a thousandfold higher than the surrounding nucleoplasm which is obviously going to have a big effect.",

And one thing that amazes me is you know you take proteins out of the cell you put it in a test tube those things are sticky sticky sticky and fall out of solution and they're not happy but in the cell molecules like trehalose and glucose help maintain that solubility. And so you know how do you bridge that right? People can say we understand the effect of a crowding on protein structure and folding and I'm sure we do but is it the same thing that happens in the cell? You know I don't know. And I guess the other thing I would say is what is the consequence of molecular crowding dynamic molecular crowding regulatable molecular crowding on emergent properties like cellular mechanics. And that's where we get really excited because we think that there's a lot of room here to consider the impact of you know how does crowding and its tunability influence cellular viscoelasticity.",

So often computer simulations try to help on one much much smaller scale this is something I did in the past for proteins. Like a very cool experiment that I kind of envision I'm not doing experiments so I'm completely dreaming here but Caitlin maybe this is something that you can do but I don't know I'm really spitballing. But you can track interactions between proteins using FRET and there has been some very cool research to do that in basically a microscope where you follow the FRET signals you can even resolve that spatially and you can see dynamics you can see things folding opening closing falling apart and if you can do that with multiple FRET pairs at the same time you can kind of see things moving out of the way so that something else can actually interact with something. So very often we we we think of these things in terms of how does molecule A and molecule B interact and how does it bind but we don't think about okay how does molecule C interfere with that how does it move out of the way and for that interactions of C and B and C and A of course are also important. But if you have multiple FRET pairs that you can monitor all at the same time in different channels you may be able to kind of disentangle that and then actually explain some of the more general mechanical properties that you can observe. That would be fantastic. Tall order.",

So label one partner with one fluorophore and the other with another and monitor FRET between them and we use temperature perturbations to get on and off rates as well as binding affinities and then mapping that to regions of the cell so we see differences in affinity in vitro in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus and I do have some evidence for differences in droplets at least for motion into and out of the droplet at different temperatures. So it's something we can look at and we've built a three color system to try and do assembly. But something I'm also interested in is the structure and the activity inside the droplets and so PFK for example is thought to form a filament structure and that's been seen in vitro but not in cells. So using infrared spectroscopy or infrared imaging we're hoping to look at the actual structure in in the droplets and then by using infrared labels in a region that is free of infrared modes monitor activity associated with those different structures. And then we use our perturbation techniques to cause phase separation to occur and look at changes in the activity. So we get kind of a spatial map of activity in the cell.",

Also you know heavy isotopes have a unique vibrational mode so if you feed a cell glucose for example you can monitor incorporation of the C13 labels so I think these kind of approaches could be very complementary to mass spectrometry approaches that have been well developed.",

And it was at higher temperatures that you could see the granules but presumably some of the same chemistry is happening before you can even see the condensates. So yeah, I don't, I think no, there's no definition and a lot of it has been very qualitative and so that's been a problem. And I agree Mike Rosen and Roy Parker had this great P-body quantification paper and that was like one of the first, I don't know, there needs to be more of that because I think without quantification it is just very qualitative and again people are saying they're liquid-like, they're gel-like, they're all these things but without quantification it's uncertain.",

But in a cell you're dealing with dozens of different components that are always there at at different concentrations, different modification states, you have activity in there. So so I think that and we've seen some some very promising results that that we will see much more complex morphologies, maybe something where an interface is actually important for for activity and not just the bulk phase but the the edge or the the connection between different sub-phases so to say which gives it you know some some sort of structural connection like maybe as you see in the nucleolus where you have the different layers and then you transition from one phase to the next to the next and they're all functionally connected and not just through some biophysical rules that create layers.",

But if you FRAP like the lamina for example, which I would call a molecular complex, it doesn't. And so there are other ways. I guess the other thing I wanted to point out or maybe emphasize is it seems like, you know, condensates are the are a big topic, right? And they're only one part of molecular crowding. They're a very specialized part of molecular crowding. And it's important. So it's, you know, looking at work like from Fred Chang at UCSF has this beautiful, I don't know if he got it published yet, paper showing that by modulating the density of the cytoplasm you change the dynamics of microtubule polymerization in really interesting ways. And so the thing I'm really curious about is with big, you know, macro-scale changes to molecular crowding, you're changing so many different reactions simultaneously.",
