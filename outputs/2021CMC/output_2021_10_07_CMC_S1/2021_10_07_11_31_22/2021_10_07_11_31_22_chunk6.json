If you can do that in a living cell and then you can basically kill the cell and deplete the ATP and see how thermodynamically things are now changing, maybe the droplets are now coalescing into larger droplets, how that changes. And that would be pretty cool if you can generate this contrast. What what does the non-equilibrium steady state where everything is moving, you have molecular motors kind of zooming through it, probably kind of pushing things apart, while if you don't have that anymore, how how do things change? That would be pretty cool.",

There was a couple paper, Carsten Weiss's lab and Simon Alberti, they had differing opinions on what was driving this because there's pH changes and then there's ATP depletion during like glucose starvation. And they said that the whole cytosol becomes glass-like, just that everything, just all diffusion slows as you drop ATP in the cell. Again, whether that's conserved, exactly what was driving it, it was unclear. One paper was saying it's pH changes, other was saying it's the ATP drop, but there it seems like it's not just changing the condensates but that everything becomes just like frozen kind of if you do that.",

I think Alan Drummond had a cool paper where he was seeing Pab1 separate into a non-soluble fraction before he could see actually phase-separated gran or condensates in the yeast. And it was at higher temperatures that you could see the granules but presumably some of the same chemistry is happening before you can even see the condensates. So yeah, I don't, I think no, there's no definition and a lot of it has been very qualitative and so that's been a problem. And I agree Mike Rosen and Roy Parker had this great P-body quantification paper and that was like one of the first, I don't know, there needs to be more of that because I think without quantification it is just very qualitative and again people are saying they're liquid-like, they're gel-like, they're all these things but without quantification it's uncertain.",

And I think it's it's probably very much in flux at this point what what people describe as that. And so so one thing that that I'm really excited about is is that we're gearing up to do this kind of multiplexed imaging with very high resolution to really map out structures and and we all know that all these in vitro reconstructions use maybe two, three components so that that very much limits how many phases you can observe. But in a cell you're dealing with dozens of different components that are always there at at different concentrations, different modification states, you have activity in there. So so I think that and we've seen some some very promising results that that we will see much more complex morphologies, maybe something where an interface is actually important for for activity and not just the bulk phase but the the edge or the the connection between different sub-phases so to say which gives it you know some some sort of structural connection like maybe as you see in the nucleolus where you have the different layers and then you transition from one phase to the next to the next and they're all functionally connected and not just through some biophysical rules that create layers.",

Again, what that threshold is and how many, yeah, what by random chance you just have proteins that are higher concentration versus this is a true condensate I think is unclear. But I think part of the problem was people called these like liquid-liquid phase separation and that's, condensates I think should be more encompassing and it's just higher concentrations, right?

I guess the other thing I wanted to point out or maybe emphasize is it seems like, you know, condensates are the are a big topic, right? And they're only one part of molecular crowding. They're a very specialized part of molecular crowding. And it's important. So it's, you know, looking at work like from Fred Chang at UCSF has this beautiful, I don't know if he got it published yet, paper showing that by modulating the density of the cytoplasm you change the dynamics of microtubule polymerization in really interesting ways. And so the thing I'm really curious about is with big, you know, macro-scale changes to molecular crowding, you're changing so many different reactions simultaneously.",
