So I think for the discussion if everyone has a link how does this sound for like so basically if we start with the obvious which is or mainly because Neil and I are probably sitting in the room, the limitations with mass spectrometry which could be an obvious answer to spatial proteomics is that it has these inherent limitations. So it's limited spatially by copy number, ionization efficiency and we don't really have a defined human protein or proteoform reference or database like we do for other technologies. So because of these things some of the inherent challenges we might hope to address are the amplification problem. And then the solutions we came up for for those and even if you can't amplify some of these don't directly address the proteoforms or the post-translational modifications. So maybe ways in which we can label, enrich or sort those and then sequence. And then the other challenge is do we just need new sequencing techniques other than mass spectrometry for proteins and peptides. And then there was a large discussion on reverse translation, molecular motors and like kind of using that can we use that technology in a creative way to address the challenge. Is there anything else that we should put in?",

Maybe the only other point that as sort of an open question at the end or or sort of a contrasting approach might be we we talked briefly I forget who brought this up but this sort of I noted this down as targeted versus untargeted. We can do spatial proteomics with alternative techniques if we have a very sort of defined analyte we want or we even brought brought in the MIBI technique for example for multiplexing like 40 or so proteins but it's just the targeted versus untargeted challenge.",
