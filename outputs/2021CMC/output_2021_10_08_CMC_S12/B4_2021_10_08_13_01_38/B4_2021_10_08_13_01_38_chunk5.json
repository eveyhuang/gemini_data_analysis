            "transcript": "use of chemical probes that were specifically made to detect particular residues which if there's an amplification pretend that you just wanted to know the composition. If you had particular probes that identified each amino acid instead of having to actually ionize each one you'd be able to at least figure out the composition of the sequence but not the order because of that amplification issue that we have. But anyway yeah I think probes to detect particular sequences that aren't antibodies seem important.",
