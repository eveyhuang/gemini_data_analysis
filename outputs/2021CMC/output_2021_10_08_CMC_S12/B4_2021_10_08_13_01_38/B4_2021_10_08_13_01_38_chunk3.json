            "transcript": "Okay. And I think I mean the important point is that there's sort of like two two different approaches that I think Stephen kind of captured in his comment pretty well but you can take sort of a you can isolate certain certain cells in some ways and you can prep a sample differently and like yes I think the techniques are getting better in terms of multi-cell bottom up proteomics where you essentially take that mixture and digest it see what's all there and and go down all the way to maybe single cell levels if there's multiplexing techniques now where you can kind of barcode individual cells and then you can mix them all together so you increase essentially the the the sample amount but you can use the barcodes like isotope tags to kind of de-convolute how much of of every peptide was in in each individual sample. So that's on the one hand but then if you yeah to do the spatial resolution I think you were really also limited I think in terms of like what the techniques are so with with MALDI ionization then it's really about like how large the laser size is to kind of ionize different regions or I think there's some some interesting sort of nano ESI based techniques on surfaces where you can kind of digest little droplets on on tissue preparations for example but again still I think in the micron range so like nowhere near single cell resolution or subcellular resolution.",

So so maybe like we can break it down into like you know if we want to come up with some like single molecule or single cell proteomics maybe it's okay that we lose the spatial resolution because we don't we don't really have that with these other technologies that we're trying to like strive for in terms of the the sequencing.",

I I mean I think Neil what you said about yeah having antibodies to enrich the limitation would be having an antibody for each protein it's a bias.",

So this is actually you know I was thinking this is actually a very interesting point that back to this George Church technology back in five six years ago I think they are starting to barcode these proteins with a DNA sequence just simply you can actually do a either biochemical reaction we're also thinking whether that can be integrated into a vector when you express the protein is just something that you can do at the same time. So with that I think you can sequence or screen them on a chip or you can you know screen them at a large scale because that's going to be coupled by next-gen sequencing just the same way as RNA-seq and other things. I think I don't know how this can be scaled up and then applied to many different areas but definitely something that can couple with NGS.",
