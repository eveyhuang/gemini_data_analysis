And ways, experimental ways to characterize them are hard to come by and there's also another complication is that these membranes are not always like the each leaflet could be different, similar to the plasma membrane, there can be asymmetry across the the two bilayers. Something that we've been toying around with is neutron scattering of virus viral particles to see if we can fit, I mean we do molecular simulations, see if we can fit our molecular simulations with the power spectra that you get from neutron scattering. And the idea is to again, you know, kind of like the spirit of basic physical chemistry is if we our predictions from the molecular level can fit can tell us more about what is going on in the life cycle of virus. I think this something that Martin also mentioned which is this trans-layer diffusion, how lipids diffuse from one into another, also has consequences on the geometry and the morphology of the of these compartments. So, I mean this just adds to the complicated picture of these compartments and as Martin is saying and others have echoed, we don't really have high resolution information of how spatially there might be like so-called lipid rafts or they can be microdomains for these lipids and that definitely in our view has plays a role in in the life cycle of viruses. I imagine also plays a role in other cellular compartments. In terms of experimental techniques as I said, neutron scattering is something we're toying around with but is still work in progress for for entire variants.",

But I think what's missing from those techniques and kind of when Michelle was talking, it sounded like she was discussing like a dream technique where we could see where everything's at. Single molecule fluorescence techniques, I mean the limitation is the number of colors and the number of dyes you have, we're never going to have like the full picture. You can only multiplex so much. So moving beyond fluorescence or I guess there's single molecule scattering techniques now that you don't have to be labeled but you're still limited on the complexity there. So something",

And you know again it would be really beautiful if one could come up with some kind of a probe microscopy method that has like nanometer resolution you could actually look inside a cell with infrared light. But again as far as I know nobody has come up with some an instrument.",

It does have quite nice resolution to it but again like doing it on live cells is a totally different can of worms. But but we're getting really nice data on on some fixed samples and some ex vivo like sections that are very thin. So that's a that's an interesting technique that is currently is very new so it's currently rather underutilized but I'm hoping that you know more and more users and experts will become especially on the on the analysis of it, right? Because you get when you get an IR spectra there's so much information right and the processing of that and the peak coupling of the the signals and the peaks and the association of those to an actual interactions and chemical species is really where the the heart of it is.

And you can you can do you can customize it also and adjust the laser so there's a lot of user customization you could do, add lasers, adjust the the way you would excite. It's really interesting. So we're just you know starting to to really dive into into it and there's just a few faculty members that got together and wrote an MRI grant you know to get this instrument in and to start to develop the the expertise and it arrived during COVID. So now we are we're making our first steps into into using it and it's interesting right because we have our AFM users and we have our IR chemists you know and and physicists and you need a hybrid person right that understands both. So it takes kind of like a group effort right for all of us to come together and and figure out that beast. But it does it's already generated really really interesting you know as you look at cytoskeleton for example assemblies right and and you could see both the interactions right the secondary interactions and some of the chemical species in in an organization on a fiber right and it gives you insights that otherwise you wouldn't have. It's really really interesting.",

I feel like a lot of times when we're thinking about experimental techniques, we're thinking about the instrumentation and you know the better the optics and that but I wonder you know I feel like from this expansion microscopy view of things, is there something we can do on engineering of the biological systems to change the length you know so that we don't need this high resolution. Um you know that like rather than trying to improve our resolution from the instrument side of things, try to decrease the need for that from the biological side of things.",

But I like the idea of changing the scale because then that also changes you know the limits of detection because we're always thinking about the number of moles you know how many copies are of something that you're trying to detect is in there because you know mass spectrometry it's it is great it's untargeted it has unlimited numbers of channels right as long as the thing ionizes.
