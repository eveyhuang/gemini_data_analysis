      "transcript": "into physical properties, things like viscoelasticity of the membrane or elasticity and all these properties that are essential. And ways, experimental ways to characterize them are hard to come by and there's also another complication is that these membranes are not always like the each leaflet could be different, similar to the plasma membrane, they can be asymmetry across the the two bilayers. Something that we've been toying around with is neutron scattering of virus viral particles to see if we can fit, I mean we do molecular simulations, see if we can fit our molecular simulations with the power spectra that you get from neutron scattering. And the idea is to again, you know, kind of like the spirit of basic physical chemistry is if we our predictions from the molecular level can fit can tell us more about what is going on in the life cycle of virus. So I think this something that Martin also mentioned which is this trans-layer diffusion, how lipids diffuse from one end to another, also has consequences on the geometry and the morphology of the of these compartments. So, I mean this just adds to the complicated picture of these compartments and as Martin is saying and others have echoed, we don't really have high resolution information of how spatially there might be like so-called lipid rafts or they can be microdomains for these lipids and that definitely in our view has plays a role in in the life cycle of viruses. I imagine also plays a role in other cellular compartments. In terms of experimental techniques as I said, neutron scattering is something we're toying around with but it's still work in progress for for entire variants.",

      "transcript": "I liked Martin's point about I guess how single molecule and super resolution techniques are really getting pushing the limits of like the size of what a protein is. But I think what's missing from those techniques and kind of when Michelle was talking, it sounded like she was discussing like a dream technique where we could see where everything's at. Single molecule fluorescence techniques, I mean the limitation is the number of colors and the number of dyes you have, we're never going to have like the full picture. You can only multiplex so much. So moving beyond fluorescence or I guess there's single molecule scattering techniques now that you don't have to be labeled but you're still limited on the complexity there. So some...",

      "transcript": "And of course there are things that allow more multiplexing like infrared, you know you have narrower lines, you can see a lot more, but then you have resolution problems because how do you make infrared... because the diffraction limit. And you know again it would be really beautiful if one could come up with some kind of a probe microscopy method that has like nanometer resolution, you could actually look inside a cell with infrared light. But again as far as I know nobody has come up with some an instrument.",

      "transcript": "So we've been using lately AFMI, which kind of combines the AFM imaging with the IR spectra. It does have quite nice resolution to it but again like doing it on live cells is a totally different can of worms. But we're getting really nice data on on some fixed samples and some ex vivo like sections that are very thin. So that's a that's an interesting technique that is currently is very new so it's currently rather underutilized. But I'm hoping that you know more and more users and experts will become especially on the on the analysis of it, right? Because you get when you get an IR spectra there's so much information, right? And the processing of that and the peak coupling of the the signals and the peaks and the association of those to the actual interactions and chemical species is really where the the heart of it is.
