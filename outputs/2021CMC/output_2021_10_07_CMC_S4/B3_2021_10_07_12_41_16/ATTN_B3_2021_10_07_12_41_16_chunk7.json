You know the fact that it is important to have barriers between different processes on different time scales that can sort of control how long things persist. I think we discussed this in context with the idea that different compartments might have jobs that take different amounts of time and occur on different length scales and so what you even call a compartment then depends on what it does. You know something that needs to do a 10 microsecond job is a legitimate compartment even if it exists only for 10 microseconds and something that needs to do a one day job you know needs to stick around probably for a day.",
