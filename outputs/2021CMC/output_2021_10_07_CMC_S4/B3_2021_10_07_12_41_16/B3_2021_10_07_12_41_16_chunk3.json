Is that kind of the picture that people have in the field of how viruses even arise because that is kind of an origin of compartmentalization question.",

So I think a lot of times it's like we see signals they're on or we start with the low hanging fruit but I think more and more we've been thinking about is it really the subtle changes that are dictating things rather than focusing on the big on off. So I think that kind of plays into some of this.",

So are those metabolite changes like how much is needed and also how fast are those?",

            "transcript": "So the changes are subtle the the changes in concentration are are are in the the micromolar but the specific they're highly specific though. So they at least in the case of retroviruses and retroviruses we're lucky because there's so much research and we know so much about them. But they're highly specific it's not an unregulated process so it's clear that that the virus has evolved to recognize those specific metabolites. That's the view that there is no well I'm using the word evolution but it's adapted to to recognize those those metabolites as a signaling element. Now actually I'm talking about lentiviruses and if you compare the lentiviruses are the ones that need to get into the nucleus but if you look at a retrovirus which can infect a cell that doesn't have doesn't need to go into the nucleus they don't they don't use those metabolites. So so yeah I mean it's like kind of like an imprint of a cell if you want and at a specific time frame.",

            "transcript": "So this is something that I was really interested in and I know very little about. So in terms of our own research we're really interested in what part of what drives like one of the things that we're interested in is the circadian machinery is the the translocation of proteins sorry that's my dog behind me the translocations of of proteins back into the nucleus from the cytoplasm and and I I really oh sorry I'm just trying to scroll through I think Holly made the point about there are all these systems that people are looking at that are completely cell free versus cellular systems where the cellular systems are you're having a constant influx of energy and what is the role of that and how much does that change the dynamics of of what's happening in the in the actual cellular environment that people are trying to model. These are all just really I think interesting I don't have any answers but these are all really interesting points and I'd and I'd also raise two two things. One is that not all compartments are created equally right and so so how do we know what the the composition and the driving factors of different components actually are and different compartments actually are and then also how do we how do we track and follow and be able to study them in a more real time environment. I know mass spec was brought up right but but we want to have something that's that we're able to actually understand what is the time scale what is what is the change in in constitution or composition because one of the other things that I I actually put down is in terms of driving these components is is uh are how much how much involvement are concentration gradients right so the what's in not just what is inside of the the compartment but how much of that is inside of the compartment. And so I guess I'm kind of been soaking it all up but I I don't have any really good answers.",

Is there a lot of evidence for circadian control of these different compartments like organelles or these phase separate I actually don't know I I've studied organelles and I've studied circadian rhythms and I've never thought of them together before.",

            "transcript": "Right so so it's it's a great question and I don't know the answer to that. So I do know that circadian so so things that happen in a circadian time frame are obviously we need the the organ the organelle compartments to be able to function in them. So there there is a connection between them and the fact is that the circadian rhythm drives so many things downstream but also there's also such a huge amount of entities that feed back into the circadian rhythm that it's probably more likely to be a a feedback mechanism rather than one driving the other but I really don't know the answer to that.",

            "transcript": "Well we can thank the fact that the earth is not gravitationally locked to the sun that we have all of these things to worry about. I I guess it's not even clear even for for for membranous compartments right since Holly mentioned we should give membranes a little bit of of due course as well. Like I just recently realized that people for instance in the field of plant biology when they simulate membranes actually just simulate model membranes that have like whatever POPC in them and maybe one or other thing and that's about it. But real plants have actually very complex membrane compositions that are actually totally different from animal membranes on top of it. And so to some extent these kinds of details must also matter because they sort of define what the phase transitions in membranes are and how proteins need to be embedded in them and how easily things can actually diffuse through the membrane like I mean there's membranes where water can even get through them reasonably easily and there's ones that are really very impervious and all of those kinds of things are going to control the dynamics of membranes. So even there I think there's a lot of stuff that we just don't know or or even if we kind of know it we're sweeping it under a rug and and not necessarily bothering putting it into our models even though it could greatly improve the models. Now there is speaking of technology and there are things that are coming a little bit to the rescue like like doing single molecule tracking is moving from sort of 20 nanometer resolution and and maybe milliseconds time resolution to like one or two nanometer resolution and microseconds time resolution now with new instrumentation available. So that should help because at least we're getting kind of the size scale of a single protein molecule and 100 microseconds is far away from the time that it takes to diffuse through a cell so now we can look at subcellular diffusion. But people here have mentioned metabolites and we're still far away from being able to image those and their distributions properly inside cells. It's often has to be like a mass spec experiment where you sort of break open the cell and interrogate what was there at that instant in time. And people are racking their brains what to do with infrared spectroscopy and other techniques to try and sort of maybe make that work for metabolites but I don't think anybody has come up yet with the like brilliant solution.",
