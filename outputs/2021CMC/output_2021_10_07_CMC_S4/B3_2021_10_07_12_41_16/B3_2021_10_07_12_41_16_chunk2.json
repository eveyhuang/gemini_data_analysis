So it's not even easy to see from just free energies and thermodynamics it's sort of it depends on where you are and the chemical affinities for different molecules for each other and how that sort of helps these length scales be where they are. I think that",

Is it the length scale of it or is it dynamic of it or like it's stable for enough time where it can actually execute a certain function for a certain amount of time or it's the length scale of organization that consists a compartment or is it both?",

There could be a compartment that needs to be around for 10 minutes to actually get the job done that it's supposed to do. There could be something else that needs to be around for 10 microseconds to do the thing that it needs to do. And I would say in their own right both of these things could be considered compartmentalization for different tasks that are on on different time scales. Lydia I mean you do work on protein polymer interaction so what do you think about this issue of actually assisting cell compartmentalization or modifying it beyond what's natural by using polymers?",

So I think compartmentalization even goes smaller than that of the gradients and local concentrations below that and the kinetics of producing those small molecules too so",

I mean I actually suspect that you know there is of course a huge group of biologists who are trying to make synthetic organisms right like building cells out of vesicles and then putting things in them. And I think whenever when I listen to the talks there I think what's often missed is that you need to have exactly that kind of time and space dependent temporal organization and that often doesn't exist in these systems they are pretty static still and then people sort of wonder why isn't this thing alive? That's because this whole network of time scales and length scales is basically missing from the equation right now.",

A self-assembled system is something that's assembled at equilibrium and is dead basically right like a virus. A self-organized system is one where there's energy running through it and that's that's that's an alive system and many of these things that we're talking about are self-assembled systems um and and so the the need for that continued energy input is maybe one of the things that's missing in in many of these uh attempts.",

I mean we we think about cell size for example and we know cell size is same across organism right it's pretty consistent. Uh but then how about the the compartments or the lifetime of compartments like worms versus human like how how are these time scales are adjusted to the life of an organism. We know now from proteomic studies that the protein lifetime actually changes from mouse to human for example. But then how do we think about the lifetime of compartments for example are they consistent are they always the same or different if we compare I don't know drosophila cells versus human cells that's something I don't know.",

I mean there are you know cells do eventually die and need to sort of replicate all the time but there certainly is a quite wide range of actually cellular lifetimes before a cell dies. And I bet you it goes all the way down to the level of basically individual protein molecules and RNAs and so forth in the end. We know that some get degraded quickly and some get degraded very slowly. There's proteins that can live for months in your bloodstream and there's ones that stick around for a few microseconds and they're gone.",

So something that we try to connect is how our mechanical properties of the virus connected to the different stages of the life cycle. So for instance if you can relate the plasticity of the virus to a specific life stage and if that plasticity could be modulated by the addition of metabolites so for instance if certain metabolites are present in a specific region of the cytoplasm that communicates gets communicated to the to the virus and the virus then I'm just going to say make a decision but has the ability to sense those those regions. So yeah the the discussion as I see it is um is definitely related to our work and in the sense that we're very interested how how proteinaceous containers have these inherent properties and is encoded all in the in the",
