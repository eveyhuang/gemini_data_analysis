So like mass spectrometry is inherently inefficient at creating ions. So they've incorporated this like secondary lasers to make it more efficient. So I think the sensitivity and resolution is it's really it's advanced quite a bit in the last even five years. So it's just still like it's copy number limited, ionization efficiency, but they're working on making that more efficient.",

So a general question is how do we characterize the true diversity of life?",

And that's why they're often kind of hidden away from us even though they might be totally yet unknown compartments or things in them, right, that that uh you know",
