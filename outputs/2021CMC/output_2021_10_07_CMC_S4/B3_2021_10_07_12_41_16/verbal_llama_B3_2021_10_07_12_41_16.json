So something that we try to connect is how our mechanical properties of the virus connected to the different stages of the life cycle. So for instance if you can relate the plasticity of the virus to a specific life stage and if that plasticity could be modulated by the addition of metabolites so for instance if certain metabolites are present in a specific region of the cytoplasm that communicates gets communicated to the to the virus and the virus then I'm just going to say make a decision but has the ability to sense those those regions.

But they're highly specific it's not an unregulated process so it's clear that that the virus has evolved to recognize those specific metabolites. That's the view that there is no well I'm using the word evolution but it's adapted to to recognize those those metabolites as a signaling element. Now actually I'm talking about lentiviruses and if you compare the lentiviruses are the ones that need to get into the nucleus but if you look at a retrovirus which can infect a cell that doesn't have doesn't need to go into the nucleus they don't they don't use those metabolites.

These are all just really I think interesting I don't have any answers but these are all really interesting points and I'd and I'd also raise two two things. One is that not all compartments are created equally right and so so how do we know what the the composition and the driving factors of different components actually are and different compartments actually are and then also how do we how do we track and follow and be able to study them in a more real time environment. I know mass spec was brought up right but but we want to have something that's that we're able to actually understand what is the time scale what is what is the change in in constitution or composition because one of the other things that I I actually put down is in terms of driving these components is is uh are how much how much involvement are concentration gradients right so the what's in not just what is inside of the the compartment but how much of that is inside of the compartment.

I I guess it's not even clear even for for for membranous compartments right since Holly mentioned we should give membranes a little bit of of due course as well. Like I just recently realized that people for instance in the field of plant biology when they simulate membranes actually just simulate model membranes that have like whatever POPC in them and maybe one or other thing and that's about it. But real plants have actually very complex membrane compositions that are actually totally different from animal membranes on top of it. And so to some extent these kinds of details must also matter because they sort of define what the phase transitions in membranes are and how proteins need to be embedded in them and how easily things can actually diffuse through the membrane like I mean there's membranes where water can even get through them reasonably easily and there's ones that are really very impervious and all of those kinds of things are going to control the dynamics of membranes. So even there I think there's a lot of stuff that we just don't know or or even if we kind of know it we're sweeping it under a rug and and not necessarily bothering putting it into our models even though it could greatly improve the models. Now there is speaking of technology and there are things that are coming a little bit to the rescue like like doing single molecule tracking is moving from sort of 20 nanometer resolution and and maybe milliseconds time resolution to like one or two nanometer resolution and microseconds time resolution now with new instrumentation available. So that should help because at least we're getting kind of the size scale of a single protein molecule and 100 microseconds is far away from the time that it takes to diffuse through a cell so now we can look at subcellular diffusion. But people here have mentioned metabolites and we're still far away from being able to image those and their distributions properly inside cells. It's often has to be like a mass spec experiment where you sort of break open the cell and interrogate what was there at that instant in time. And people are racking their brains what to do with infrared spectroscopy and other techniques to try and sort of maybe make that work for metabolites but I don't think anybody has come up yet with the like brilliant solution.

Something that we've been toying around with is neutron scattering of virus viral particles to see if we can fit, I mean we do molecular simulations, see if we can fit our molecular simulations with the power spectra that you get from neutron scattering. And the idea is to again, you know, kind of like the spirit of basic physical chemistry is if we our predictions from the molecular level can fit can tell us more about what is going on in the life cycle of virus. I think this something that Martin also mentioned which is this trans-layer diffusion, how lipids diffuse from one into another, also has consequences on the geometry and the morphology of the of these compartments. So, I mean this just adds to the complicated picture of these compartments and as Martin is saying and others have echoed, we don't really have high resolution information of how spatially there might be like so-called lipid rafts or they can be microdomains for these lipids and that definitely in our view has plays a role in in the life cycle of viruses.

It does have quite nice resolution to it but again like doing it on live cells is a totally different can of worms. But but we're getting really nice data on on some fixed samples and some ex vivo like sections that are very thin. So that's a that's an interesting technique that is currently is very new so it's currently rather underutilized but I'm hoping that you know more and more users and experts will become especially on the on the analysis of it, right? Because you get when you get an IR spectra there's so much information right and the processing of that and the peak coupling of the the signals and the peaks and the association of those to an actual interactions and chemical species is really where the the heart of it is.
