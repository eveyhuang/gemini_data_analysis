There's been some really cool work also with broader fret sensors where they can they look at the stochastic response in different single cells in tissues. There's a there's definitely a growing growing field. We're all borrowing the metabolite sensor field borrows a lot from the from the calcium sensors and the GPCR sensors and so forth. That was just one idea of how you could outline",

And so even like does anybody else know I mean like you get these five or 10% changes of of a metabolic pathway and I think that's significant. Whereas in in a proteomics or RNA-seq if you get a 10% change you're like that's a yawn, you know, you're yawning. Is that is that the right view of of these",

      "transcript": "It's interesting. So a lot of the times the sensors are limited by looking at steady state levels and it depends how you know it depends on the KD of that enzyme that uses it. And you're absolutely right that one of the challenges for designing these things is that you need to amplify small linear changes to bring bigger readouts. But we're starting to be able there's other there's metabolomic fluxomics they call it approaches where they're trying to look at flux through pathways as opposed to the steady state levels and this this kind of ties into the one of the next sessions of non-equilibriative modality or I don't even know what that word means modality but non-equilibriative pathways. And it's still super early to be honest the field. And this is still just intracellular like we're not talking about on a physiological scale yet even with you know like how the liver and the pancreas talk to each other to the that like that's not even in the discussion we're just talking even within a cell or tissue. And transporters are related I feel like I should stop talking though. But transporters are related too because they produce materials sometimes to other",

But it's it's tough, right? You single cell proteomics you're at about a thousand proteins and they don't change a lot in that abundant proteome or in the abundant metabolome you're not are you're not getting much differentiation. So maybe single cell RNA-seq or it currently today that that's the way that people are defining cell types. Is that the right view or do do other people have other axes that they analyze?",
