We're all borrowing the metabolite sensor field borrows a lot from the calcium sensors and the GPCR sensors and so forth. That was just one idea of how you could outline.",

And so even like does anybody else know I mean like you get these five or 10% changes of of a metabolic pathway and I think that's significant. Whereas in in a proteomics or RNA-seq if you get a 10% change you're like that's a yawn, you know, you're yawning. Is that is that the right view of of these",

So a lot of the times the sensors are limited by looking at steady state levels and it depends how you know it depends on the KD of that enzyme that uses it. And you're absolutely right that one of the challenges for designing these things is that you need to amplify small linear changes to bring bigger readouts. But we're starting to be able there's other there's metabolomic fluxomics they call it approaches where they're trying to look at flux through pathways as opposed to the steady state levels and this this kind of ties into one of the in one of the next sessions of non-equilibriative modality or I don't even know what that word means modality but non-equilibriative pathways. And it's still super early to be honest the field. And this is still just intracellular like we're not talking about on a physiological scale yet even with you know like how the liver and the pancreas talk to each other. That's not even in the discussion we're just talking even within a cell or tissue. And transporters are related I feel like I should stop talking though.

But it's it's tough, right? You single cell proteomics you're at about a thousand proteins and they don't change a lot in that abundant proteome or in the abundant metabolome you're not getting much differentiation. So maybe single cell RNA-seq or it currently today that's the way that people are defining cell types. Is that the right view or do other people have other axes that they analyze?",

Like so in the kidney you people are talking about the glomerulus and the cortex at region and then and then they have these repeating FTUs that that go around and I can now understand the biology of the organ connecting the molecular to now higher level functions because I have this construct well-defined called a tissue unit.

You can you can slide up and down a whole scale for these questions but I'm usually comfortable with if the cells work together to produce a particular thing or do a particular function that's the functional unit in my mind.
