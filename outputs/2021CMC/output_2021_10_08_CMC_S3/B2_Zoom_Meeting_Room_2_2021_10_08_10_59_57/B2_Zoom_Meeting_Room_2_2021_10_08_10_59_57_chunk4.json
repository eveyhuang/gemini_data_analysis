But then it's very difficult to trace the messenger molecules to understand cell-cell interaction. And my colleagues are using even having to give up whole fluorescence-based imaging, but instead using PET, the PET imaging in vivo in order to track certain like T-cell subunits. And especially for messenger molecules such as lipids and others that cells use to interact, those are very, you need I think certain more ultra-sensitive technology is needed here.

And then luminescence, but then luminescence, the spatial resolution is kind of poor. You can engineer sensors for detecting specific molecules, but then you sacrifice the spatial resolution. Same with like PET or MRI, I guess. MRI can be pretty fast, but then also like spatial resolution. So I guess ideally is that if people can engineer the next generation MRI or PET and then with different mechanism and can achieve that much better spatial resolution and also, I know there are now people engineering MRI probes that can also be used to recognize specific kind of enzymes or molecules, and those can give very good temporal resolution, so spatial resolution it can be cracked down. So maybe eventually one day we really can be able to look at in these live organisms and to look at these signaling events. But I don't know how long that would take.",

Um, and yeah, so it's an interesting or just non-molecular imaging. Like PET was mentioned, you just mentioned one that's like a it's it's lower, you can get enough information about a biological system through other images and if we just applied the resources there, you know. So I don't know, it's probably it's going to be a little bit of A and B here, but um, but I think within our decade here, we are going to have a very different operational paradigm about how to connect phenotype with molecular work.
