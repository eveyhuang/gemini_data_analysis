Anybody else who wants to type their thoughts in there is so welcome. And if you want to say it verbally that's fine too. But it sounds like we have so we all know at the end of this we're going to take our conversation and distill it down into a bullet point PowerPoint type thing. So let's keep that in mind as our discussion unfolds. So does anyone want to start us off with the maybe the question of defining the aware of the notes. Sorry, we'll put the link right in the chat for you. Thank you Alex.",

So it's a bridge between the molecular and cellular up to phenotypic. So that's just a kind of wet your appetite I suppose. I'll stop.",

I'm thinking about this sort of idea of tissue units and cellular neighborhoods as a function of mechanical properties of the tissue. And I'd really love the idea of heterogeneity in mechanical properties of cells in a tissue representing functional tissue units or ways that the functional tissue units can communicate with each other. And using various uh biophysical techniques like microrheology or AFM or what have you to kind of parse out those differences and how they communicate with each other. And I think the most exciting thing that I've been really for me at least thinking about is how does metabolism kind of act as a parallel pathway to regulate the mechanical properties of these functional tissue units.",

            "transcript": "I mean you're talking about subunits among cells and stuff. So we have to remember that the geometries of cells are very diverse and there's extremely disparate sections with even you know within one cell or even the broad category of a neuron has so many different shapes. So I think where I'm going with that is the connection potential connection I've been always thinking about or I'd like to think about is between metabolism and that. I mean you've got lipid metabolism you got to make more building blocks you have to do that stuff you have to it's almost Lamarckian. It goes a little bit against what we think about usually but it's Lamarckian where it's you have an adaptable system that can immediately respond perhaps but there's also a cross talk with metabolism and cell sorry gene expression or transcriptomes and so that could also overlay some things. Cell shape is a one that's a little trickier because you know it doesn't always except for some very motile immune cells it doesn't really have a plasticity. But where was I getting but there's tons I mean metabolism is really great and it's near and dear to my heart and lots of great cross talk with with different things biophysical things as well in terms of compartmentalization and so forth. Just two thoughts just to get the conversation going. So how do we I put on the on the notes that you know I think about this a lot and I think despite technical new technical approaches are starting to really open up the world but this almost could is is a place where engineering and biology has a really deep there's just a lot to explore and Wenjing I know with your GPCR sensors too I mean there's that directly addresses a lot of these things.",

I do this kind of mapping of cells and tissues with all this kind of seek myself and I work in two systems and one of them the anatomical features really illuminates the functional units beautifully and then when I switch to the other system all those morphological landmarks are gone and the same functions are happening but we don't know how to draw any boundaries. So I think I you know and metabolism readouts are not something that's really widely examined in a very fine detail on a cell by cell basis in a tissue. So I think that would be really exciting to look at. So are there any kind of sensors that that help with that?",
