I study stem cells in the tip of the fruit fly testis and in the mouse testis. So I think about cells inside of a tissue all the time and how they're dealing with their neighbors and how we might probe that better. So I'm really excited about our topic. And my plan is to have a have you guys each put a number between 0 and 99 into the chat right now. And I will pick a random number from my cell phone and that will be our reporter. And then if you guys like, we can also have a separate person that could be the scribe. Do you want the reporter and scribe to be the same person or do you want separate people? Raise your hand if you want the same person. Okay, raise your hand if you want separate people. Okay, good. I see some votes for separate. Okay, so then we'll first pick a reporter and then we'll pick a scribe. All right, and I got to work my stopwatch for a sec. Did everybody put a number in? Okay. The number is 85. So that means Taras, is that right?",

I mean you've got lipid metabolism you got to make more building blocks you have to do that stuff you have to it's almost Lamarckian. It goes a little bit against what we think about usually but it's Lamarckian where it's you have an adaptable system that can immediately respond perhaps but there's also a cross talk with metabolism and cell sorry gene expression or transcriptomes and so that could also overlay some things. Cell shape is a one that's a little trickier because you know it doesn't always except for some very motile immune cells it doesn't really have a plasticity. But where was I getting but there's tons I mean metabolism is really great and it's near and dear to my heart and lots of great cross talk with with different things biophysical things as well in terms of compartmentalization and so forth. Just two thoughts just to get the conversation going. So how do we I put on the on the notes that you know I think about this a lot and I think despite technical new technical approaches are starting to really open up the world but this almost could is is a place where engineering and biology has a really deep there's just a lot to explore and Wenjing I know with your GPCR sensors too I mean there's that directly addresses a lot of these things.",

It's easier to define the cell type and people can use an antibody against different biomarkers belonging to the CD series on the cell membrane. But then it's very difficult to trace the messenger molecules to understand cell-cell interaction. And my colleagues are using even having to give up whole fluorescence-based imaging, but instead using PET, the PET imaging in vivo in order to track certain like T-cell subunits. And especially for messenger molecules such as lipids and others that cells use to interact, those are very, you need I think certain more ultra-sensitive technology is needed here. In other words, there could be a lack of tool available.",

Same with like PET or MRI, I guess. MRI can be pretty fast, but then also like spatial resolution. So I guess ideally is that if people can engineer the next generation MRI or PET and then with different mechanism and can achieve that much better spatial resolution and also, I know there are now people engineering MRI probes that can also be used to recognize specific kind of enzymes or molecules, and those can give very good temporal resolution, so spatial resolution it can be cracked down.

Like PET was mentioned, you just mentioned one that's like a it's it's lower, you can get enough information about a biological system through other images and if we just applied the resources there, you know.
