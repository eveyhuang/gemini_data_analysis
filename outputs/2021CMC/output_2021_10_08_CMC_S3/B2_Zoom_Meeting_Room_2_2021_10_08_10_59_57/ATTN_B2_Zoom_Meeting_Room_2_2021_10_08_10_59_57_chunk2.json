I like to read that there. Anybody else who wants to type their thoughts in there is so welcome. And if you want to say it verbally, that's fine too. But it sounds like we have so we all know at the end of this, we're going to take our conversation and distill it down into a bullet point PowerPoint type thing. So, let's keep that in mind as our discussion unfolds. So, does anyone want to start us off with maybe the question of defining the aware of the notes. Sorry, we'll put the link right in the chat for you. Thank you, Alex.",

As you do that within the context of of an organ, in mammalian or vertebrates or less so in plants, but you know, that that you define cellular neighborhoods and this functional tissue unit, the concept of a a thing, a unit of hierarchical organization that's not at the tissue or organ level, but rides on top of the cells and cell types and and and leads one to think about complex phenotypes. So it's a bridge between the molecular and cellular up to phenotypic. So that's just to kind of wet your appetite, I suppose. I'll stop.",

I'm thinking about this sort of idea of tissue units and cellular neighborhoods as a function of mechanical properties of the tissue. And I'd really love the idea of heterogeneity in mechanical properties of cells in a tissue representing functional tissue units or ways that the functional tissue units can communicate with each other. And using various biophysical techniques like microrheology or AFM or what have you to kind of parse out those differences and how they communicate with each other. And I think the most exciting thing that I've been really for me at least thinking about is how does metabolism kind of act as a parallel pathway to regulate the mechanical properties of these functional tissue units.",

So I mean we have to remember that the geometries of cells are very diverse and there's extremely disparate sections with even you know within one cell or even you know the broad category of a neuron has so many different shapes. So I think where I'm going with that is the connection, potential connection I've been always thinking about or I'd like to think about is between metabolism and that. I mean you've got lipid metabolism, you got to make more building blocks, you have to do that stuff, you have to it's almost Lamarckian. It goes a little bit against what we think about usually, but it's Lamarckian where it's you have an adaptable system that can immediately respond perhaps, but you know there's also a crosstalk with metabolism and cell sorry, gene expression or transcriptomes and so that could also overlay some things. Cell shape is a one that's a little trickier because you know it doesn't always except for some very motile immune cells that doesn't really have the plasticity. But where was I getting but there's tons I mean metabolism is really great and it's near and dear to my heart and lots of great crosstalk with with different things. Biophysical things as well in terms of compartmentalization and so forth. Just two thoughts just to get the conversation going.",

If this cell, what's it doing in this context or in this tumor, this heterologous tumor or in this complex tissue. One of the advantages of sometimes using specific probes is that you get to see the details that might be missed when you have the forest. I mean there there is an argument for looking at the forest, but there's also an argument for being able to parse out, I mean that's what sparse labeling is sometimes, you know, like you're able to parse out how this one thing can connect to the other, what's that relationship and how is it stochastic or is it a patterned relationship? So I know it's probably an unpopular opinion but I still think that there's a a role for
