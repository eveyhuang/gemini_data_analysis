So being able to make a synthetic environment and that environment uh really takes under consideration every time a certain feature. If it's stiffness, but it's not just stiffness, it's also architecture that are obviously very related to how the the the the ECM is also structured uh in terms of assembly. Is it fibrillar? Is it bundling? Is it a network? Is it heterogeneous? Is it homogeneous? Do we care? Does the cell care? And maybe every cell cares about a certain a different one, right? We have different tissues. And then how the cells are really incorporating all those inputs. Um and another really um complexity with this or how to interpret those results is the dynamics, right?

So like with Paul's example of EGF is passing through the ECM, if it has to reach that receptor, from the perspective of the protein, a fact of value of like stiffness that Michelle brought up, that's how the cell culturing people think of it. But from the perspective of the protein, is it really sensing a stiffness? It's sensing or it's seeing the surroundings as like heterogeneity in like the chemistry around it, the charges, the different forces it's feeling that way on smaller length scales. And it's also viewing the heterogeneity of like confinement and of these static or somewhat flexible barriers around it as well. So I don't think we've applied tools at the nano scale to the surroundings there. And I think we focused on okay, when the EGF reaches the receptors, that's when we start using the nano scale tools inside once it gets to the receptor on the membrane, the signaling cascade within the cell. But before that, it's just kind of assumed that like oh those metabolites or those signaling proteins, they make it there.

        "utterance": "Abhishek Singharoy: Yeah so actually Alison and me we actually have a funded project running through the Moore foundation through the CMC on something that is related and so might be yeah but the question is the question is how to frame the question. I think that's where we are at this point of time thinking. So in terms of to do computations to do any sort of theoretical analysis first of all we have to kind of give this problem some sort of a basis and that's what I was primarily thinking. So one basis can be forces. So what we had thought of is can we introduce something like a mechanophore an object that kind of changes its color based on the mechanical properties around it as a probe of the of the force environment heterogeneous or homogeneous whatever that might be. We were primarily thinking intercellular because a lot more work has happened on an extracellular level but still let's say mechanophore as an object as a reporter for what is the force environment of a cell was something that that we have been thinking about because that gives me a basis something called a force field essentially within which now a bunch of mechanical responses can be computationally achieved. That's from a very you know hardcore physics perspective. Now let's think of learning and that's what I was looking up might be the colleagues here can comment on. Normally when this is such a multi-scale problem when you have let's say inputs and outputs let's say inputs at a molecular level as at the level of proteins and outputs that are felt at the level of you know the cell ECM interactions which itself are not very well defined might be models can be built with a very clear focus in mind that here is my molecular level input and there is my intercellular communication level output. And purely as a bookkeeping without any understanding at a priori just collecting data at the molecular level and then seeing their manifestations at the intercell communication level one can come up with a model and then one can test it by introducing different kinds of perturbations like some sort of mutants that changes the elastic property of the protein that we're talking about and let's see how does that reflect in the holistic outcome of the cell and then create that map to start out with as a computational tool because going real all physics multi-scale might not be the best way here possibly it's not even possible. Some scales become irrelevant when some other scales become important as someone was telling. So it's better to find out if there exists any causal relationship that kind of those kind of feature selection and outcome selection if we can have that kind of a table made then might be one can have and enough data then one can have a map between these two. And finally one last point I would make is why would we not care about you know as was mentioned finally when a complex gets made at the interface of the two membranes when this membrane addition happens we start only caring about that part not before that. Reason possibly is because anything that's happening before it is not rate determining. We are often interested in highly rate determining events something the slowest part of the system. Might be the diffusion of the proteins on the membrane despite its being very very interesting it might be the reason one haven't looked too much into it is because that diffusion process is not the slowest process in this entire cascade and one is interested in the rate determining the slower processes and changing those kinetics in a way and to see the effect of cell ECM interactions in that perspective. So these were my three point thought that if we can make a table when we don't have physics at least data science has taught us make a table. If we can make a table then from there we can learn something. So yeah that would be my two cents. ",

Because Abby you know actually Jeff Moore was the advisor of the person that that Abby and I are consulting with on our mechanophore project. Yes it's always Mary. Very small world. Um but to follow up on what Abby was saying I think you know that's what I really like about the project you know seeing the forces of life is what we called it that we are you know working on with the support of the CMC is is that we really have tried I think with our team to trace sort of span the the different scales where you know we have Abby's computation where we're looking at you know even like the forces between bonds in an individual tether between what's pulling and what's fixed in the cell and the extracellular environment and then you know we have these chemical tools that we've developed that fluoresce or create a signal once we've passed a certain force which is definitely at the level of you know cell and protein type forces and then we're working with Ross Wang who's also you know here this year too and on our project where the ultimate goal is to then look at sort of a macro scale or at least a cellular scale phenomenon of cell migration and take it all the way from sort of the forces that bonds are experiencing in this tether to the sort of phenotypic output of that one protein force that's being felt to what the phenomenon is on the cellular scale of migrating. So I think like that's definitely something that came out of this meeting and we're looking to to try to make a little bit of inroads at least on this specific topic between the nano scale and the macro scale. Yeah so I thought maybe a progress report or plug our project or something but um switching gears a little bit to my own lab one thing that hasn't been brought up yet that we're really obsessed with is metabolism and signaling metabolites that are exchanged between different cell types different organs and even different species. So it's really hot right now as you know the microbiome and metabolites that are being secreted by this whole you know universe of microbes in our gut and how that affects our health. But it also shows up in sort of endocrine signaling within tissues where you have the immune system is something that we work on that communicates metabolically between different immune cell types and spurs all sorts of different you know differentiation and response processes. So my questions with respect to metabolism here would be you know how how do we sort of trace the origins and receptors of signaling metabolites either between cell types species and organs and then I guess a dream that I had was you know how do we engineer technologies where we might be able to say you know use a bump and hole technique so we can create these labeled signaling metabolites in one species or one cell type and then trace them as they travel to different organs and actually get to the molecular level and see what receptors they're interacting with and how that sort of rewires all of these broader signaling pathways.

So you know, so in the case of the interaction between lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells, one of the critical phenomena is the formation of something called the immune synapse where MHC molecules and and T cell receptors complex and what's been observed is that basically they're, you know, basically entire protein complexes can basically transpose from one membrane to the next, right, based on this particular complex. And you can imagine that of course if you have a network of of forcefully interacting cells, then that means that potentially you can have sort of the propagation of of translated proteins over a large length scale in a in a controlled way, right? Whereas of course, you know, once a cell releases a metabolite, it no longer has control over that metabolite.

Yeah so I mean one one big area is actually related a little bit to to what Stephanie mentioned before is thinking about uh when when there's an injury or trauma to uh to the environment and especially in the context of brain uh so we've been looking at um the extracellular matrix of the brain that is mainly laminin based and then how to think about making networks uh that would present this different type of cues of laminin but really what happens when something uh like traumatic brain injury or spinal cord injury happens right and then that scar is forming right and that scar the tissue is completely the environment is completely changing and it actually uh starts looking more and more like a collagen matrix although collagen is not a big player in in brain at least not collagen one. Uh so what we've been able to do for example is make synthetic matrices that recapitulate that architectural um uh trauma-based change where it's stiffer but it's also more bundling and it's tighter uh versus a a loose uh soft network that would be more like brain and when you culture uh cells especially the cells that are involved in the uh scar forming cells like uh astrocytes uh then you see the phenotype changing between when they are cultured on these bundled stiff matrices versus they're cultured on this uh more uniform soft matrices but the real key was to be able to transition between these two states so really where we come in is the dynamics of it so can we take that stiff environment and dynamically alter it to the softer network and then what what would happen to the phenotype of the cells. Uh so we've seen that when you do that the cells actually can revert their phenotype from a very scar-forming reactive state to a quiescent normal state which means that the environment there is playing a huge role in in the scar forming uh process and if we were to understand it better or even be able to control these transitions of the environment we might be able to think about reverting diseases or states like spinal cord or traumatic brain injuries. So but there's more to it than just the physics and architecture right the the so so that's the beginning to unravel the really huge complexity of that. Yeah. ",
