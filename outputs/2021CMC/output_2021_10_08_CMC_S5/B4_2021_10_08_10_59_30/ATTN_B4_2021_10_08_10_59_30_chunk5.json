      "transcript": "Yeah, yeah, that would be more functional than just isotope. It's an analogy. Yeah, very nice. And also on the topic that you both touched, which is communication. Abhijit mentioned diffusion and Alison mentioned using metabolism. Another way of cell communication or cell-cell communication in specific is through the membrane nanotube that they can transport things. As a matter of fact, in one of my student's Lidiya's experiment, she and Jackie from biomedical engineering found that you put an older cell and a young cell together to form the membrane nanotube, the older cell can be rejuvenated, which is a great news I think for for this group. Paul and I love to mingle with young people again. Just a lighthearted comment, but we want to hear more of you about if you can do one thing. Thank you Gary. Thank you. Yeah, so if you can do one thing in this topic, what would that be? Pipe dream welcome, current technology great. So the floor is yours.",

      "transcript": "So one thing that I actually wanted to just bring up although this this may you know I guess this can tie this into you know the one thing that that would be useful technologically is that you know in the context of of of sort of molecular transport one thing that I don't think has been mentioned is just the phenomenon of trogocytosis in immune cells specifically but just that understanding to what extent that phenomenon extends to other types of cells as well. So you know so in the case of the interaction between lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells one of the critical phenomena is the formation of something called the immune synapse where you know MHC molecules and and and T cell receptors complex and what's been observed is that basically they're you know basically entire protein complexes can basically transpose from one membrane to the next right based on this particular complex. And you can imagine that of course if you have a network of of of forcefully interacting cells then that means that potentially you can have sort of a propagation of of translated proteins over a large length scale in a in a controlled way right whereas of course you know once a cell releases a metabolite it no longer has control over that metabolite. Nevertheless if you have a network of of antigen presenting and T cells that are that that have formed these specific immune complexes then you could have sort of a a controlled transport of proteins over very very large length scales even though the cells themselves are much smaller.",

      "transcript": "Well well well one so so it's it's the transposition between antigen presenting cells and T cells. Any given antigen presenting cell can certainly complex with a very large number of T cells and so even though I'm not entirely sure if sort of like the actual measurement has been traced for any given molecule to to kind of you know trace that network I'm just kind of arguing from first principles then it that it seems to I mean it must be happening at some rate. I guess it's it's it's reasonable to kind of ask okay well you know if you have sort of you know some sort of membrane deformation perhaps you know there's some way in which the curvature of the membrane prevents you know there's some fundamental length scale limitation but just that to the extent that membrane diffusion or diffusion you know around a membrane is is fast then you'd expect that to happen. And so yeah I mean you know so I guess you know I mean I guess from from sort of the one thing that I think would be really useful is to you know try to understand you know what what are the determinants of you know of of of what governs that length scale of of transport you know whether or not you know we you know it's just a question of measuring right you know like the force exerted between membranes certainly you know immune synapses are largely a function of kind of the the curvature between two membranes but just that you know perhaps there are other determinants and you know and if you have that information perhaps you'd be able to you know better define what is the relevant unit of abstraction right whether or not you know perhaps it is just two cells or one cell but you know but maybe it's under certain
