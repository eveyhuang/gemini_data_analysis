            "transcript": "I was thinking about yeah like mini organoids and how they're like super hot right now but like how accurate are they? I feel like they're pretty homogeneous in terms of like what cell types are in there. Um and like one of my colleagues his whole thing is he makes these like mini brains and they like sent some up to space recently to see like what happens to the brain when you go to space. Um but they but they start from like you know one particular cell type and then grow these organoids and I I feel like that can't be super accurate. Um and then this is totally like random but it it made me think like what Alison was mentioning earlier about like when the cells let off the metabolites can we like you know follow them and where did that molecule come from but same with the ECM right? Don't the cells generate those molecule macromolecules and then like do they this cell you know sent out something and then did it go really far away and generate part of the ECM over there or does it stay like localized around that cell? Is there a way to like tag them to kind of see like you know in this tissue this cell generated this like these pieces of ECM that went wherever is it like totally mixed or or yeah is it like localized near the the cell that it originated from?",

Um so that will be our synthetic wet dream.",

            "transcript": "Yep. Yeah so I mean one one big area is actually related a little bit to to what Stephanie mentioned before is thinking about uh when when there's an injury or trauma to uh to the environment and especially in the context of brain uh so we've been looking at um the extracellular matrix of the brain that is mainly laminin based and then how to think about making networks uh that would present this different type of cues of laminin but really what happens when something uh like traumatic brain injury or spinal cord injury happens right and then that scar is forming right and that scar the tissue is completely the environment is completely changing and it actually uh starts looking more and more like a collagen matrix although collagen is not a big player in in brain at least not collagen one. Uh so what we've been able to do for example is make synthetic matrices that recapitulate that architectural um uh trauma-based change where it's stiffer but it's also more bundling and it's tighter uh versus a a loose uh soft network that would be more like brain and when you culture uh cells especially the cells that are involved in the uh scar forming cells like uh astrocytes uh then you see the phenotype changing between when they are cultured on these bundled stiff matrices versus they're cultured on this uh more uniform soft matrices but the real key was to be able to transition between these two states so really where we come in is the dynamics of it so can we take that stiff environment and dynamically alter it to the softer network and then what what would happen to the phenotype of the cells. Uh so we've seen that when you do that the cells actually can revert their phenotype from a very scar-forming reactive state to a quiescent normal state which means that the environment there is playing a huge role in in the scar forming uh process and if we were to understand it better or even be able to control these transitions of the environment we might be able to think about reverting diseases or states like spinal cord or traumatic brain injuries. So but there's more to it than just the physics and architecture right the the so so that's the beginning to unravel the really huge complexity of that. Yeah.",

Uh I tried all kind of technology ECMs try to reprogram the cancer cell back to normal. Right now we make it a lot worse. We we're trying to make it better and trying to make it worse we're close to make it better. Uh before I proceed fair's fair we have another VIP aka the boss wandered into the room Sylvia could you care to do a quick intro of yourself? She want to be quiet in the background that's okay we will not force her. All right so uh we are very close uh to the final uh wrapping up I want to stop at 10 to give our uh scribe and reporters sufficient time to avoid running into the situation typing at the last minute like the other groups. Um I want to also using the last three minutes to seek input how should we report you've seen all kind of report from really good pointed report to piling up everybody he said she said uh to uh you know a collection of ideas and how should this group do the report this uh conference and this day is a final of a CMC log. So do you guys want to do continue the trend or you want to do something different here's four proposal our group thinking. Here's you know whatever you want to do we'll support you. Here's the discussion collection.",
