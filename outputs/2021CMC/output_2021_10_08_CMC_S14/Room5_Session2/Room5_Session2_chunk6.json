So are we talking about, you know, needing to do single molecule or single, sorry, single cell studies where, you know, we're looking at, you know, one cell and a series of changes that are occurring through that cell versus a population of cells. And then you have to start thinking about, you know, what is the cell-cell variability, right? Because you can't necessarily say, especially when we start thinking about things like amplitude of signal and resulting effects that all cells are going to behave similarly, right? And so, you know, what what is the context within which we're going to be looking at these signaling events?",

I mean, that's the good thing. Yeah, but there's there's 3D organoids, you know, people are trying to build up to, you know, lab on a chip, organism on a chip, actual animals, right? There's all these levels. Um, okay, so we have uh maybe five or maybe 10 more minutes to do our discussion and then we've got to uh help Abhishek put together our slide. So if we have any more, so we've talked pretty big picture here. Do we have any more uh signaling pathways that uh we really want to say is an important thing to study um as a group, um or are we want to be more general about the context, the players, the architecture, the integration of signals, the amplification of signals.

And and say, I think it's in breast cancer cells, for example, if they migrate through certain tissue and it it depends on how soft or how stiff the tissue is that activates different expression programs which then lead to proliferation of the cells or not. So so that is is really a thing. I don't know exactly how it happens. There must be some some cascade coming through the cytoskeleton probably to the nucleus. Maybe it's just a volume change that makes different things accessible or or leads to different mechanisms like say condensate formation affected by density or or pressure in that sense, which then activates different parts. So so that's certainly a thinkable cascade.",
