Um okay so we have uh maybe five or maybe 10 more minutes to do our discussion and then we've got to uh help Abhishek put together our slide. So if we have any more uh so we've talked pretty big picture here do we have any more uh signaling pathways that uh we really want to say is an important thing to study um as a group um or are we want to be more general about the context the players the architecture the integration of signals the amplification of signals.

I don't know exactly how it happens there must be some some cascade coming through the cytoskeleton probably to the nucleus maybe it's just a volume change that makes different things accessible or or leads to different mechanisms like say condensate formation affected by density or or pressure in that sense um which then activates different parts so so that's certainly a thinkable cascade.",
