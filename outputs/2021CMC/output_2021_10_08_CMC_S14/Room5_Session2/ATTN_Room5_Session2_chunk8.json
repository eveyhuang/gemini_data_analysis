So so those but very very specific in very specific ways. So but yeah like you know big papers have come out that that that have been able to show things but you can't just literally scale it across all groups today. It's not not not so straightforward. It takes years essentially like to do this kind of things. But but yeah like writing review papers and things like that to summarize as much as it can be summarized. but yeah like it's one big problem for computations is a lot of these signals die beyond a certain scales and so computations can't pick it up so simply.
