So it's like a like that's why like in a very clear case of a chemical signal called ROS its origin is starting from a chemical reaction at picoseconds and then its biological relevance stays up to seconds beyond which even if it stays in the cell no one cares the cell has already made its way out. So let's say let's say that is one signal then what else can we think of as as interesting signaling pathways and might we can put in a time like I possibly managed to speak on on this particular thing that would be good actually then we can at least have a table of cool things.",

But then you know we could conceive of you know I I'm just looking over here okay I see my husband and my heart gets warm okay right so we got all kinds of you know signaling going through the and it's happening you know in a matter of seconds right which is you know actually kind of amazing when you think about it.",
