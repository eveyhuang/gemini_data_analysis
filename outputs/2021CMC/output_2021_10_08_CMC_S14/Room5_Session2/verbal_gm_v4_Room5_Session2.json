But I I think we can go down this weird road of saying how do you define biochemical? But maybe we don't want to push that. But but I think that's a fair point. I mean like it could be a mechanical change, it could be something else, right? But I think for us anyway, it really is, you know, some interaction which in our case is a biochemical interaction causing like a functional change in the players that we're sort of defining as the the the system. But it's true that like for depending on the scale of the the sort of output or phenotype you're interested in, right? It may be that you require integration over multiple of these events or, you know, that one of these events happens for a long period of time or something like that. So I think that sort of echoes Michelle's point that it really like the the functional output depends on the signal at hand. Really there are and there are measured examples of cases where you need several short time scale events to be happening in a small time frame and the system is integrating over that before it makes a sort of decision. A good example of that is like immune cell activation by like T-cell activation works that way for example. And then there are other cases where it may be that one, you know, enzyme-substrate interaction leads to another one then there's an amplification step like Michelle was saying downstream and so ",

I think that the brain is a wonderful example of this because it's it's these neurons that have these basically binary signals in terms of action potentials right they have depolarization events and a pre versus post synaptic neuron communicates that message electrochemically basically right so depolarization here causes depolarization here but they're they're not physically touching right so unlike a circuit there's no way for that electrical information to be transduced and so it's gated by chemistry right that that is exocytosed here and then affects receptors on the post synaptic neuron to then you know relay that signal downstream. And it's it's interesting because I think this is where that concept of tools comes in as well. Being able to measure action potentials is something we've been able to do for at least about a decade or so and we've used that almost as a proxy for their chemical signaling but as new tools become available to look at the chemistry it's becoming apparent that for every action potential there could be as little as a 5 10% probability of actual neurochemical release so it it touches on a lot of themes I think that we've been discussing here about how more sensitive tools spatially and temporally are allowing to see kind of these new dimensions of information. The other kind of way that we classically at least in neuroscience probe how it is that that these signals are transduced is with pharmacology right so we add drugs to the brain we know that they agonize or antagonize receptors and so we make conclusions about what that agonist or antagonist action does and and where the role of those receptors are in the pre versus post synaptic neurons and but it's still I think that's still a very hazy method of of understanding signaling in a in an organ that that arguably is the main signaling pathway of the entire body.

So so that that that critical noise is extremely is extremely important like and again as the function of what you have what one has chosen the knowledge bounds to be this this this fluctuation essentially changes according to our knowledge. If our knowledge is too little then there is huge amount of fluctuation that is required. It's called like in statistical mechanics it's called dissipation fluctuation theorem. So if you have like a lot of knowledge then might be you can deal with critical amount of fluctuations.
