So what I did last time with my other groups has been so we go around and talk a little bit about each about ourselves a little bit and then we'll figure out who is going to be taking notes, which would be like the scribe function, and who will be reporting out at the end filling out that PowerPoint slide. And what I think works well is if we save like the last 15 minutes to get that thing done collectively. So so we then we'll have about just under an hour to talk about this topic. Okay.",

And of course in my world we want to have nanoparticles like intervene with things, you know, which is always a lot of fun. So I'm going to go around and call people that I see in order on my screen and then so again just say your name where you're from at this point we might know almost everybody, what your general research area is and then why you want to be here on signaling.
