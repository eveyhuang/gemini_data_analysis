You switch the condition this object is supposed to be robust to a range of conditions. Then something that was irrelevant in the previous condition the redundancy now becomes important. So so definitely within the cell that has been shown many a times. out like at an intercellular level I will not be able to comment but I haven't because I don't know too much about it. But definitely within the cell one of the reasons the redundancies are created so that it can be robust. And like essentially something that material systems try to achieve. They are engineered systems are very very efficient not as robust possibly. And that's what natural systems are basically more adaptable and this adaptability comes in from the robustness from the possibility of having multiple signaling pathways with different weights and the weights of these pathways switch depending upon what environment you are in. So so that that is I think at least inside the cell is shown quite well. I would not be able to comment on intercellular communication part of it.",

So alright so are there other big topics we want to cover here so we covered some pretty big ones right up front which is you know is the paradigm of signaling at sort of the molecular level even accurate. I guess that's actually very interesting to when you think about it that way and we talked about inputs and outputs right instead of signals per se. We were talking about amplification and crosstalk and I mean actually I thought that was very interesting because to me crosstalk I always thought of crosstalk as like a loss like you cared about this one pathway and anything that went to some other pathway was then be a loss for your pathway but if it actually helps amplify it then you know then that's actually again means we need to zoom out a little more when we're doing these studies perhaps right.",

So if there's no crosstalk there's not like a gauge mechanism right for the cell to say oh now I need to do this and then I'm coming back to some type of homeostasis and then oh I have to do this right there have to be these crosstalks for the cell to to respond and respond in a in a fast time scale. So I think not only the crosstalk is not noise but it's it's an essential component of the ability of the cell to process multiple or respond to multiple events at once.",

You know there's a comment in in the like prompt slide about signaling waves and those can only really exist if there are feedback loops that sort of temper the architecture of a signaling pathway. So it can look linear right but if there's still within that chain a positive or negative feedback loop or the right combination of those you can get oscillations in signal you can get you know a rise followed by a dampening of the signal and so I think um it sounds like what we're all kind of saying is that the like knowing the architecture of the signaling pathway whether it's protein level or cell level or whatever organism level um like knowing the architecture is important so like the players the architecture and like the mechanism of information processing sound like the three things I've heard so far.",

And it will not be a unique solution it will be five solutions and like a system of 50 a system depending upon five or 50 will be able to be robust enough to face different conditions. So like if one is has control on the architecture and on the as as as I said the constraints or the the players I think based on that uh uh uh naturally uh uh like a number of pathways are gonna fall out and like whether a system is is how is the system using that path those those those set of pathways is of potentially very system independent. Like that would be my thought process for seeing similar kind of examples at the molecular up to the cellular scale. that that that that often it's it's quite pervasive in those regions.",
