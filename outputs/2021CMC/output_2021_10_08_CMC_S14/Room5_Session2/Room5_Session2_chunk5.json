So it's like a like that's why I like in a very clear case of a chemical signal called ROS its origin is starting from a chemical reaction at picoseconds and then its biological relevance stays up to seconds beyond which even if it stays in the cell no one cares the cell has already made its way out. So let's say let's say that is one signal then what else can we think of as as interesting signaling pathways and might we can put in a times like I possibly managed to speak on on this particular thing that would be good actually then we can at least have a table of cool things.",

So we we've been thinking about and and this is with some colleagues who have different expertise about how can you map out in time the cascades through which these cells go and which ones of them actually make it to the final state and then can we back propagate and measure this kind of architecture of of that pathway in that sense I mean is it signaling I don't know but but so the one big thing there is we don't know the players we don't know what's going to change but at the same time it would it's also difficult to follow individual cells through that process. So so the idea that we have been putting forward it did not get funded but was to to put some sort of barcodes in the starting population so these barcodes get amplified so we can track daughter cells through the entire process and then find the barcodes that make it into the final sample and then back track and at every single time do these fishing experiments and and see what is the population the distributions of states that we have at different time points and can we just construct the flow through this network of of states.",
