            "transcript": "on understanding human metabolite signaling at the chemical level. So understanding how structurally metabolites use information in chemical structure to communicate in different regulatory pathways. And a couple of the things that I thought of for this particular session were really how do we understand how sort of at the level of transcription, these transcriptional networks within the cell, how do they sense and regulate local membrane environments? So really how do you take the sort of physical chemistry of a membrane and integrate that into the the feedback mechanisms that the cell uses to control how much of each thing is made and what signaling networks are turned on. And the other thing that I thought might be interesting is now that there's a lot of hype around sort of condensed phases or condensates, how do those condensed phases in different parts of the cell interact with different membranes and different organelles. So I thought those both might be interesting topics to discuss.",

So my lab is interested in looking at the biophysics of immune cells, especially the signaling and organization of immune cell membranes as well as intracellular organelle functions during pathogen-host interactions. And so for for this for this discussion, one of the topics that I I come up I mean question I come up with is that can we have can we have more quantitative and direct tools for understanding the interactions and you know and interactions and organization of the intracellular cellular membranes. And the second question that I'm really interested in is how do the intracellular membranes communicate and exchange content as well as information.",

I'm at UT Austin in molecular biosciences and my lab studies compartmentalization of metabolites within a cell and we're currently absolutely obsessed with this one metabolite called NAD. We recently found a transporter for it in the mitochondria and that's why I'm in this group. Some of the questions that I've been interested in include a lot of these models that we talk about for organization, subcellular organization depend on concepts of diffusion and and like gradients and so forth. We know that it's extremely highly organized and tightly packed in and all these membranes and so what is the what really is going on very locally on one hand and also if it is so local how can we both what limits does that place on if we want to exploit that or what benefit does that give if we want to exploit this precise compartmentalization in medicine and so forth.",

So we use a lot of mass spectrometry to probe the dynamics of complex formations, particularly we're looking at protein folding pathways and biogenesis, secretion processes and so that's where the transport aspect comes into play. So yeah this is should be an exciting session. So one yeah maybe two points I I wanted to highlight that I'm curious about. So one the first part was about sort of unknown unknowns what Roberto described and that's related to sort of lipid modifications or structures that we may not even know about yet that might be important for lipid identity, vesicle identity and sort of like yeah the the dynamic assembly processes. And then a little bit related to that related in terms of our research we think a lot about protein complex assembly and but how lipids interact with proteins and kind of influence the process is something that I think is still much less known about and is really hard to study with current techniques because they're either related to analyzing lipids or proteins but studying this in complex is really challenging.",

I'm a cell and developmental biologist and my lab my lab says that we study actin cytoskeleton but actually throughout my career what I found out is when I study actin cytoskeleton what I'm really studying is membrane. So that's why I'm in this group. And so when I'm thinking about membranes I'm I'm usually or very often thinking about actually the the plasma membrane and how the actin cytoskeleton interacts with the plasma membrane and exerts forces on the membrane but also gets signals from the plasma membrane and really what are all the interactions between actin and the membrane. And and the sad thing is is that I I still feel like we really don't know a lot. And and then it gets worse than that because recently we've started thinking about the the the plasma membrane as sort of a composite material because it's really sandwiched between two other materials, the actin cytoskeleton on the inside of the cell and the glycocalyx on the outside of the cell. And unfortunately you know for currently only really two of those materials get any attention, actin and and membrane and we've really so we have like all of these decades of modeling etc etc biology that's all driven by understanding the membrane and the actin but completely ignoring that there's this huge glycocalyx on the outside of the cell and how that would actually influence what's going on with the membrane and you know ultimately why I care about this I I work in embryos so I want to understand how cell shape changes is driving morphogenesis. And so we're also thinking about this in terms of it's not just each of these materials but how do they work together to give you something like cell shape change and ultimately tissue building. So that's me.",

So I've been working with undergraduate students at Santa Clara University to use second harmonic generation to monitor the thermodynamics of drug absorption to model plasma membrane systems which is why the membrane is very important to me. We prepare artificial lipid membranes. We ideally want to incorporate some membrane-bound proteins into these membranes to kind of monitor how can drugs bind in the nice thing about our laser spectroscopy method is we don't use any fluorescent tag or any kind of label. We just monitor at the wavelength of for example the drug that binds and absorbs into the lipid bilayer. I think I'm interested in I guess making better models. So right now my models are very simple like physical models not computational models but I'd like to make them more complex and more similar to real world. I know a lot of you work with real cells and I haven't I haven't done any real cell work for plasma membranes. I've just been working on artificial lipid complexes and I'd like to make it kind of connect those things together and be able to with my laser setup we have kind of average we're monitoring or getting signal from everything all within the laser beam and I'd like to be able to kind of have more spatial distribution and better resolution of understanding what's going on with kind of individual things within a thing that I'm studying like the locations of things.",
