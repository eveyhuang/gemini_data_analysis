So mainly I use spectroscopies to characterize metal binding sites. And I'm really interested in metal homeostasis, particularly copper homeostasis and one of the proteins I study is a copper transporter, a transmembrane transporter. So one of the things that's always bugged me about the paradigm for how copper is transported through the cell is there's not really any explanation for how the how metal ions get to the transporter or or are carried away exactly. It doesn't seem to make sense that diffusion is the process involved here. So I I would like to better understand how the membrane itself can be kind of a scaffold for organizing proteins both inside and outside the cell so that pathways work quickly enough for for biology to happen.",

I'm a biophysicist/cell biologist just like Anna I'm very interested in actin and the membrane and like Sandy in a former previous life Sandy interested in endocytosis. And so my questions were related to how we think about membranes and how it's a fluid lipid fluid material but actually maybe just a scaffold the support of a protein scaffold and should we just think about the other extreme would be to think about the membrane as just basically a protein membrane because it's so dense there are so many things on the membrane. And so that changes a lot about that would change everything about the way we think about how things are organized, how they move. And there's a very interesting paper came out a couple of years ago that even think maybe think about it as a gel. Maybe it could be the analogy they gave I think is beautiful is if you think about jello it's mostly water but there is a protein meshwork that makes it like a gel. And they think about the same way about a lipid membranes that it could be it's very fluid at first sight but you don't need that much anchors and that much network behind it that could be related to actin but to make it like a gel and so that that changes a lot of mechanical properties and all that stuff so a lot of things to think about I don't know.",

I am an engineer by training but my lab studies synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. In particular, I'm interested in designing and constructing microbial consortia or co-cultures with novel functions such as biosynthesis of value-added products. I'm also interested in using biosensors to regulate metabolic behaviors of cells as well as the dynamic interactions between cells in the consortia. One of the thoughts I have for this topic session is that how can we study the membrane protein functions to allow for effective transfer of metabolites between different cells inside a community or a consortia. For example, how can we use one membrane protein to secrete one metabolite from one cell and in the meantime use a variance of the same membrane protein to assimilate the metabolites into other cells to facilitate the cell to cell communication. And I would be very interested to hear new ideas about this kind of research direction. Thank you.",

My lab works in synthetic biology and we're focused on research in the area of RNA-based regulation as well as self-assembly and cell-free transcription translation systems. So I guess in terms of membrane research, I'm interested in seeing if we can develop kind of model systems that for instance vesicles that we can kind of incorporate cell-free systems into controlling the dynamics of assembly. So can we get a model system that's a little bit more complicated than in vitro systems but not quite as easier to handle than a cell. So that's where I'm coming from.",

            "transcript": "Okay, okay, good. So what I kind so in terms of what do we need to make progress, I kind of heard quite a few things here like we need better models, right? If you want to do very high-powered stuff like with lasers or something then you know you need a simple system and then if you're doing really complex stuff your methods are you know maybe more general. So so it sounds like we need better models of membranes and then also it's been pointed out that the way to think about membranes is now evolving, right? So the cartoon of the lipid bilayer with a few proteins, I mean we know there's a lot more proteins than that. So I I heard glycocalyx which I assume people know about but maybe they don't. They're just thing on top and then there's the maybe it's more of a protein thing and maybe more of a gel. Okay, so so there's some interesting sort of chemical physical ways to think about membranes which you know if we started from that maybe we get to a very different place. I mean and then there's the question of diffusion that I heard like how do things really get to the membrane? That's actually kind of a lot of things people have talked about signaling and so forth as well. Okay, so I'm going to stop talking. And then what I was anybody like to start to jump in and say well is there you know that's one question should we think about membranes in a totally different way which may then lead to us getting better models for them I suppose. Or are there questions and tools that we can think is a need that should be developed or studied. Okay, so I will I'm going to dial down. Okay, Alison, yes.",

So I think listening to both Lars and Julian kind of made me also wonder and it goes back to the theme that you brought up is how should we actually think about the the structure of membranes and you know Lars pointed out that there's a lot of lipids and actually our group works on lipids so I was remiss in not mentioning that but it's a it's not necessarily just a fluid bilayer but is it all the way to the extent that we're thinking of of jello where we have cross-linking. I mean what what sort of landscape do we have in between a fluid membrane environment that's regulated by sort of these loose intermolecular associations between lipids and and then once we start to integrate different proteins and different lipid identities and I think this goes to Dmitri's question too is like how do we think about the the actual mechanical fluidity of this membrane and it goes back to Catherine's point how does that either facilitate sort of this two-dimensional diffusion of transport substrates and how does it sort of maintain a physical integrity that will localize certain processes or prevent certain mixing events that might lead to you know undesirable interactions. So I think for me the question is really how do we like how do we parse out the different",
