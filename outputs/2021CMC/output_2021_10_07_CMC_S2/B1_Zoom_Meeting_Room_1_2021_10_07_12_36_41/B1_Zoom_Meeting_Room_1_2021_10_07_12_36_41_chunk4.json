It just changes so many outcomes. And it's kind of curious how how that happens. And that that's even without putting your protein in. That's just pure lipid.",

And I know like tomography, EM has really been especially the new like tomography cryo like the cryo stuff has really been interesting in being able to get into like very to kind of get at these things unperturbed because the problem is like once you put a probe in, you've perturbed it. And that's something that we've always had a challenge with our sensors. An example of a really specialized type is even the cristae in the in the matrix of sorry, even the cristae in a mitochondrion, sorry, that delineates the matrix from the inner membrane space. In order to keep that high proton gradient to keep to keep the ATP synthase going, they you you create like a little invagination and that's all that proton gets pumped in a really small space and so that's how you get that high local concentration of it. And that you know and that's a very specialized shape of the lipid or membrane I should say, not lipid, shape of a membrane. And it was tomography that actually was able to get a lot of this get a lot of this out without perturbing and then like you know the the ETC, the different organizations of the complex, the different complexes and stuff.",

And uh if getting so getting structural information that way which leads to a very clear gradient, you know, reason to have a gradient like you said, that's uh so again that's an interesting point, right? That the very local structure, well not local, but somewhat local structure of the membrane can really impart and part function, right?",

It's it's actually something that I realized yeah we don't we don't know how to do it so cleanly because any probe will perturb the system. Um and they are more or less specific anyway. Uh and it may or may not go uh to the right place anyway. I mean there's a lot of potential problems. Uh yeah yeah and and and the dynamics also is another level of problem because we can do cryo, I mean it's very nice, you know, you can imagine cryo so you have a nice snapshot. You could imagine something that's more even more specific and you could imagine inventing probes that would on the cryo like some kind of immuno probes or more fancy things that some of the fellows last time was talking about this EM these markers to do anyway I I I forgot the details I cannot tell but but I mean it's knowing how it is really organized and dynamic it's it's it's really difficult on the at the molecular scale. Right so I don't know if if anybody has any good ideas on advanced you know things we could do. I mean cryo is definitely a good way to go but can we get enough resolution from cryo anyway for",

I mean that ultimately if we had enough sensitivity and resolution would be an excellent way to just do an unbiased imaging of lipids. We would like to do it. We have a few probes that are would be Raman active with you know tags on them that would be useful. I think one of the things that's a limitation currently that people are obviously working on and making great strides in is the sensitivity if you're looking at very low abundance molecules the sensitivity is is kind of not nearly as high as if you use fluorescent tags or what have you depending on your system but but I think all of those things with Raman people are very interested in understanding sort of like the endogenous as we've all been talking about probes perturb the system and they're not as versatile as looking at the endogenous lipid metabolites. So I think Raman microscopy is just going to continue to get more powerful and more used but we personally have not used it yet unfortunately.",

You can certainly get sub-micron scale resolution but that's more often when you have say a large population of lipids where you don't need as much sensitivity. So if you're looking at say you know phosphatidylcholine which is a major component of mammalian membranes then you can get better resolution.
