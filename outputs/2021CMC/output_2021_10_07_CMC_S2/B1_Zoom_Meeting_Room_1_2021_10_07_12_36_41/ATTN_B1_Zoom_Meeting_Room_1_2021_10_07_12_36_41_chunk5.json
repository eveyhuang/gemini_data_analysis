      "transcript": "embryo for all of biology, right? If you're going to learn something about an embryo, you learned it about in the fly embryo first. And we know that there's a we know that there is a glycocalyx there, but have no idea what the composition is, what the regulation is of that, what how the profile changes over developmental time, which has to be incredibly important for when, you know, when those cells start to change their shape in order to build a tissue. So, I mean, really, that is such a it's for for most of the cell biology that I think about, no one has even thought about no one's really thought about that or incorporated it. And it's only now that people are starting some people are starting to pay attention. So I can't tell you anything about it because and I don't think that's just because of my ignorance, it's because we just we don't know. I see Julian's smiling because he must think about this as well.",

      "transcript": "Yeah, yeah, yeah, and it's and you know, it's funny. I I work only with yeast cells and people gave us a lot of you know, bad words because it's just yeast cells, not mammalian cells. And the more time goes, the more we realize that it's a lot the yeast community got it right before the mammalian cell community because a lot of things are actually been done cleaner in in yeast. And yeast have a cell wall that's been there for, you know, studied pretty well for a long time. And for example, for cytokinesis, everybody is focused on the acting contractile ring that generates force, but actually the more it goes, the more we realize that the cell wall assembly is polymerization is actually creating a lot of force that pushes the membrane inwards. And so the the actin ring might be just there just to localize things, not even to generate force. I mean, there are some hypotheses like that. So with the glycocalyx, it's the I've seen things that are that were going along the same lines of like, actually it does a lot of things and everybody's been kind of ignoring it because it's just outside the cell and you know, nobody cares what's outside, but actually more people care these days. So it's good.",

      "transcript": "But even it's interesting because you've focused so much on the glycocalyx on the outside of the cell, which yeah, that's where it where it ultimately ends up, but it's also, I mean, it it gets there, some of the glycans are installed extracellularly, but a lot of them also are installed throughout the secretory pathway, right? So there's there's a potential of that also influencing vesicles in I mean in the Golgi and in in the ERGIC and all of the compartments. And I don't I mean it's along the same lines. I don't maybe again it's my ignorance, but I don't know if anyone's even like looked sort of intracellularly how that shapes the membrane structures.",

      "transcript": "Yes, so I think that's a great point. And and then you bring up yet another great point, which is that while you may look at the plasma membrane, you constantly have, you know, the membrane trafficking pathways that are adding new stuff and taking stuff away at the same time. And so these, you know, so so we talked a lot about structure, which of course is is important. I back up everything that I heard earlier, but then when you start thinking about dynamics, it becomes even more complex because it's it's not a static, you know, it it's not a static thing. It's there's constantly stuff coming in and and stuff coming out. And how you know, how how all of those interactions how all of that is coordinated and how how do these systems handle that? I mean, I just it's it it's so so complex when you just zone in on one thing, but then when you actually think about it in the systems at you know, like at at let's say at the cellular systems level, then the complexity just grows. And so yeah. And I and I loved what Catherine said. Um, she said she said it so nicely, how how do you make membranes work quickly enough to do the stuff that they have to do? And I'm thinking about that constantly in terms of the plasma membrane, like how how would you coordinate all of the incoming traffic and the outgoing traffic as well as changing the shape at the at the same time. And I know that many of you are thinking about it in terms of, you know, like how do you take stuff in? Um, and so how do you make all of that how does the, you know, how how does that interface with the biophysics of the of the membrane of that material and how does it how does it happen? And I just you know, we we see that it's a problem as biologists, but I think we we don't have good tools and all of the things that you said about probes being perturbative, that is that's like that's always the problem for us. It's like anytime anybody comes up with a new probe, it sounds great on paper. One group makes it work, and then, you know, we try to take it into our cell and everything falls apart. So, um, so, you know, I'm I don't I don't have solutions. I mean, of course we're, you know, of course we're doing theory. Of course, we're trying to also, you know, work with material scientists to to come at it from many different directions, but I don't I don't feel like we have good tools yet at all.",

      "transcript": "I mean, I I can just make a plug for chemistry, I guess. Um, in that, you know, a lot of times when we look at and I'll return to lipids just briefly because I don't I really don't know that much about the glycocalyx, but I think it's an excellent point to consider, you know, intracellular membrane environments that could be influenced similarly to the extracellular side of the membrane. But for lipids, we tend to look at them as just being like this big jungle or tangle of of carbon and hydrogen in cryo-EM when when we see them in cryo-EM structures, which is kind of rarely to be honest. But a lot of times, you know, the key attributes of a certain stretch of a membrane will be whether, you know, how many double bonds are introduced in the phospholipid tails of the lipids in the bilayer. And and I think the fact that so many that in the PDB you don't see the membrane, you know, we're losing a lot of information about how the shape of the lipids influence the types of proteins they interact with and then, you know, even beyond the PDB, how that influences the dynamics of those particular proteins. So I think one thing that would be kind of a pie in the sky is to look at sort of the shape-based complementarity between different types of lipids and different types of membrane proteins that might either localize them in the same place at in the simplest perspective, but also as we're talking about curvature and different scaffolding proteins that interact with lipids to make these invaginations and so forth. Like if we could get a better understanding of exactly how the lipid content complements the types of proteins
