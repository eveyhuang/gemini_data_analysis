So that's, in a way, I think the membrane composition might be some kind of clock, I guess, that times the the progress, I would say, of those reactions and changes of the organelles inside the cell.",

So we can get the we can get to the plasma membrane, that's why it's been studied. We can get to we can isolate microsomes, we can isolate exosomes, like extracellular things, but but having specificity is very challenging. And that's limited also, I think, some of these questions that you just brought up with how how vesicles get dynamically remodeled or or changed in composition with yeah, with with time or even even statically. So if we had ways to that's like a need to to maybe address how to how to label some vesicles in a perturbed way or maybe not better non-perturbed and isolate it through other things than just differential centrifugations or gradient centrifugations, that would be awesome.",

I mean, that's pretty limited. I mean, you can do it, but that's limited by the to a certain concentration range. I mean, so so that's, I mean, as a chemist, right, that's another thing you'd like to know, like, well, how many vesicles do I have, right? And okay, so there's not that many methods there either. But yeah, the isolation is another big pain, right? That's another roadblock. So we think I think we have about five more minutes for our discussion, oh boy, and then and then we have to help Lulu put together our one slide. So, um, okay, are there other points people want to make about problems that need to be overcome, areas of inquiry that are understudied, connections between things we've talked about? Like we haven't mentioned too much about the mechanical nature of membranes, but that's another right, you could have the, you know, maybe a similar chemical composition over some length scale, but the mechanical properties might be different depending on how, you know, I guess I never think about lipids being cross-linked, but maybe they are. Certainly it's easier to think about proteins being cross-linked. So any other thoughts?",

Is that really the only way? And I I don't I again, I don't have the answers to that to that question, but um, it seems like even when we're trying to understand what's going on with membrane, we actually glaze over 95% of what's going on with the membrane.

So it's like, okay, let's get homogeneous media and saying that you're at a scale that's high, you know, large enough that the details don't really matter anymore. You can talk about an average property of But I I agree. For example, basically endocytosis is just, I mean, it's breaking the these endocytosis, exocytosis, we still do that, but we know it's not it's not okay because just the thickness of the membrane is 5 nanometers and the shapes we're looking at are 50 nanometer in diameter. So it's still, you know, it's like 10% and and 50 nanometer is the largest, right? So we kind of completely ignore the details. And actually when you try not to ignore the details, the reviewers complain because then the models kind of you're at the limit of the the way you can model this kind of things. You have to create what you call singularities and then the math is not as clean and there's a lot of of things that even reviewers don't feel comfortable with, you know, even that that we add more kind of details in a kind of indirect way. So it's a matter of tools and computational power, I think, that that's missing.",

And then as the discussion went on, okay, so the first one I kind of organized, we started talking about rethinking biophysical mechanical properties of membrane, like what is the range of fluidity and the dynamic, what's it governed by? This is just really broad, but some stuff that I thought was really good started coming out. Structure, this particular point that it's structure plus dynamics to give us the function, I thought, so yeah, so I have that and but you know, there's so many unknowns. How is it regulated? What's the coordination? What's the sensor? How do you model it? And then we had to started getting into how do you study membranes. And then I had this expanded section here on how the shape of the membrane, this should be a separate, shape of the membrane influences the proteins that can interact with and looking at the complementarity between membrane shape and protein complex shape and to like ID possible pairs but kind of map it on a larger scale so that you can make inferences about composition to shape, like this axis, lipid composition shape to protein. And then our conversation went into intracellular membrane, which I thought was really cool because it brings up the different chemistries that are encapsulated with each one. We talked about endosomes, but there was also, you know, peroxisomes have different differential oxidation perhaps bilayers or lysosomes. And then we ended with we need better models for studying complexity.",
