Um is it we only have about a minute I think before we're going to get the signal that we have a minute. Um anything else that you all feel like would be interesting to point out. Part of what we're trying to do is sort of push the edge of what we might know or what we might ask because it's to try to get you all to think about what might be a good question to ask for a proposal but it might also be one where you say well I think this is a question that should be asked but I don't know who else would be interested in it so if you can get this question in maybe it resonates with someone who wasn't in the room. So that's why there's advantages to getting some if there are some other points that you think are important to getting them in.",
