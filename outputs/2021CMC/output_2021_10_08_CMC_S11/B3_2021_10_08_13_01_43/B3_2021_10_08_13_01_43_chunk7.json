And then yeah I mean if you you know propagating a signal in an embryo could be a harder problem. And that's where you start seeing specialized mechanisms where things are often moved around by cytoplasmic flows rather than pure diffusion or you get these waves in which one molecule activate the next and you get this spatial propagation. But normal you know small looking cell and probably similar problem are present in neurons right where to send a signal from the nucleus to a synapse could be it takes specialized mechanism because diffusion is not going to work. If you are a yeast cell things are going to diffuse within a couple of seconds so that's not a problem.",

And I start to wonder if the concept is even useful anymore because it's kind of something we all talk about but we none of us is saying the same thing when we're talking about it. So probably I guess we should move to some more precise terminology and just drop so this could be our take home message that just stop talking about self-organization.",

So I wrote is the definition is the definition of self-organization in the eye of the beholder? At what scale does the cell need it and use it? And I think Gulcin got really excited by this idea of of size mattering and self that of the observation of cells having a kind of a size and what is the hidden theory or the the sort of the hidden principle that has driven that size? Is it like it's like a scaling law almost. What is the scaling law for the size of scales of size of cells and is it somehow connected to signaling and self-organization? And I'm going to change that to scaling law. Physicists think of scaling laws as opposed to a scaling model in a very specific sense. I'm not I'm just pretending to be a physicist.",
