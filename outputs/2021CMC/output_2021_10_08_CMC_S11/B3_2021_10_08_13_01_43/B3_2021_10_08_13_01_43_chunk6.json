Right? So so what how what's the right size? And is that does it depend on the on the particular type of signal, the particular type of function? Or is there some invariance? And is that something that one could try to develop a statistical mechanical theory to develop what's the right size scale or what is sort of a a way of of of framing size? And you know to for Gulchin's favorite question, what is self? You know in order to know self, you need how how much how big is it before there'll be enough signal to be able to recognize itself as opposed to not being distinguishable from others. So there's also so it may be nuanced by the fact that you need distinguishability. So does size matter? Simple question.",

I guess um but you know I I guess right I mean I I would argue that right um that at the point that one's talking about you know you know organization is being the you know the kind of the primary you know noun within that within self-organization that that that that everything is it's all about determinism. So basically you know any you know any any area of you know any length scale or or time scale on which um determinism arises from what would otherwise be you know rare events, um you should be able to have self-organization. So if it's a very small length scale then you would expect that that uh it would depend on there being large numbers of molecules at a very dense space so that you're not limited by counting statistics whereas you know if it's in a much larger space then you know or or you know maybe if the if the behavior is kind of some uh some expectation that something will happen uh over a certain window of time then then then perhaps that type of thing is is uh less necessary.",

If we think about we always give this example in like classes, a giant squid, the axon is extremely long. And maybe we can start extracting some information and maybe using more computational tools, why neurons expanded themselves for so long beyond the size of any other cell type. So if size matter that much, why neurons are the exception? Right? Because for the same circuit, you could build same circuit with five neurons, but then why is it different? Why is it an exception? I think maybe we can start answering the question about size if we start looking at the exceptions. And this is one example that I know, maybe muscle cell is another example that becomes muscle via fusion, right?
