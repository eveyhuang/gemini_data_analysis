You know something that times every event that you know that instructs every cell of what to do at every time. I mean it seems that I always think that if you build a control that way the amount of control you need is too much right. There must be some ability of the system to get to the right state without external instructions. At least for part of the process.",

I guess my you know my my question would just be whether or not you know it's not obvious to me that we that that one can simply supplant the attribute of robustness with the attribute of self-self-organization. I I I I guess that particular distinction is actually lost on me to the extent or or perhaps it's sort of already been seeded. Um but um um you know I mean it seems to me that you know clearly I mean you know when when one can make claims about for example in the case of embryology you know the the the time scale on which robustness is attained right uh during the you know but just that that doesn't necessarily um in any way say it's uh it's somehow you know um less of a process of self-organization right. Um like in the same way that you know um yeah I mean sort of uh in any physical process you know you always have sort of a nucleation event and so if one simply claims that you know the formation of an embryo is a type of nucleation uh that then or sort of an initiation of some nucleation that um you know that that ultimately right the the robustness is you know whenever it's obtained is is then where self-organization takes over.",

            "transcript": "Um you know I I really don't know anything about like on the on the scale beyond a single cell level like you know in terms of robustness. But if we just look at I guess look at cell or intracellular level right um you know the the number of copies of receptors can vary from cell to cell. They all function you know they all perform the same function but the distribute there's a distribution right of number of copies of receptors. There's a distribution of um you know there's a distribution of uh you know size and uh shape of the same uh organelles right in different cells. There's a distribution of like kinetics of chemical reactions even inside the same cell like for example you know endosomes they will have different kinetics of chemical reactions even when they perform the same functions. Um and um and also based on you know what we know about um the for the you know the phase separation in in the cell functions and clustering of proteins aggregation of proteins can see that there is a range of um sizes I guess you know um that just seems to lead the the same outcome. So from I guess this is more like observation rather than trying to explain why that is but based on the observation seems like there is quite a buffer room the cells are designed to have those buffer room that they would reach the same goal even if there's some deviation from in all those processes from the beginning of you know the expression of protein to to how how the signal pathways come together.",

Um the the the advantages of fluorescence imaging is that it's very direct right you can visualize the spatial and temporal changes of a given molecule of interest. Um the I guess the not really the disadvantage but I would say more like a limitation is that unless you know what you're looking at right so you have to know like this is the molecule I'm interested in. And the limitation also comes from the fact that you can't look at um the spatial and temporal changes of one molecule or two. Um but beyond that you know it's extremely hard to do from technical point of view technical difficulties. Also I I don't know a very effective way in fluorescence imaging that allow you to say you know this two these two signaling waves let's say they actually have some correlation rather than just coincidence. I mean it's really hard I think it's really hard to prove the correlation between the different signaling molecules. Um but but in my opinion that's probably even more important in understanding how the cells function rather than just looking at the spatial and temporal changes of one single molecule.",

So I guess it gets a bit to to some of the question that was raised before by Gulcin of how do you even call a signal self-organized.",

Um so I think multiplex um imaging can address some of these but then um currently you can look maybe four to six um colors by fluorescence that that's still not ideal. But maybe um it might be possible to like look at these individual processes look a lot of them across different cells and different time and then use computational methods to kind of simulate them to find a way maybe there's some kind of rules and can assemble them together in some way. I guess that's what is not here. Um yeah trying to do yeah.",

But then I'm also wondering if you know you can get bigger and bigger in terms of having so many signaling pathways and neurons are great examples of that we're talking about a cell a meter long right they're huge but they're specialized and that size is achieved for a function and their signaling pathways are very complex yet it's regulated at millisecond scale and we're still trying to understand how these things are coordinated.
