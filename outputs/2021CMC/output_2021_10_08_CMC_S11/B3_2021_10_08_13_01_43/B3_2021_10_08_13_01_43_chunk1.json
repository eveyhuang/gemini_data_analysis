So the first thing that we have to do is identify who's going to be the speaker and who and and the the at the last session we actually had a person I mean the speaker would be the presenter. We actually found that having a presenter assigned that's the reporter and having a recorder assigned really helped to distribute the load. So I'm going to what I'm going to do is you're going to type in the chat box if you will a number between one and 100 and the person who gets closest to the the right answer they will be the reporter and the one who gets the second one is the recorder. So I don't know which is the preferred one because the last one the person who got the first one wanted to be the recorder not the reporter but anyway the closest to it will be the reporter and the second will be the recorder. And and to you know some people think oh I'll say 100 and then I'm going to be only half of it but I we we go around like a clock so so it's it's either way. So so that way it makes it even. So one two three four five six seven eight nine. Okay Catherine but you probably and we'll we'll see what happens. So and Joshua and Davide Davide symmetry broke from from Joshua. So I'm going to now turn on the my stopwatch and what I do just so you see this it's on right so it's just doing some arbitrary numbering and the last two digits is the one that of that number that's one that's really fast. So someone want to tell me to say stop say stop.",

If you go to slide 48 that will be where you're going to type your key points. And then Gulcin you there? Cool. So I'm going to put in the chat box and this is something everybody can see. So if you go there that's the where we were going to put in the breakout notes. Okay and what we're going to do next now that we know who the reporter and the recorder are is just go around the room and make sure that everyone has an opportunity to say their name and your location. We almost all know who your name and your location is so just name and location and the next item will be a something interesting and different. And this interesting and different is because Romy stole my idea the last time of foods. So I'm going to riff on foods and say what is your favorite restaurant? So just what is your favorite restaurant and that favorite restaurant you'll have to at least tell us the city so we can maybe someday know to go to it. So your favorite restaurant and in in the city okay. And I'm going to type in the chat box the order that I see all of your faces so that way you'll know the order in which you're going to give this remark in. And so if you can see the chat the if you can see not the chat box sorry I'm putting it in the Google Doc. So Wenjing and oh and I always tell people I just say your last name so that way you can correct my pronunciation of the last name but you say something different by saying your first name.

My favorite restaurant in the whole world is probably a restaurant whose name I don't remember it's in Hokkaido and it's a restaurant that only serves uni. And it has uni soup it has uni quiche it's like a 10 course 10 courses of uni and it's absolutely fabulous. But in the United States I would probably go for Cafe Mogador in New York City just because it's a fun Mediterranean restaurant owned by Israelis and and the vibe is amazing so I would recommend that as well.",
