The question is, what are the experimental and theoretical approaches to understand self-organization in biology? E.g., phase separation, signaling gradients, signaling waves, especially when arising from the integration of biochemical and mechanical signals. And you all came here thinking you wanted to either pitch an idea or ask a question. Pitch an idea would be a sentence. Ask a question would be a question. So I'm going to give you about two to three minutes to think of your idea, your question. And if you could write it next to your name in the Google Docs, that will help us remember what it is. But then we'll go in sequence with everyone reading their question, making the statement, and expanding on it a little bit. So, I'm going to give you three minutes.",

So yes, you can look at an article I wrote about the ducks quacking if you had seen that. Um, so let's see. I'm going to go in order of everyone who spoke before. Uh, and then we'll just sort of quickly, we'll go through everyone giving a little bit of an idea of what they want, but but if you want to pitch in and say, well, start to riff off, that's okay.

I guess my, so my question is more like, uh, not in the molecular level, but then I'm just so amazed by how this development works and starting from one single cell and then every time during the cell division and all the signaling, it can recapitulate so perfectly every time. Um, but I'm an outsider so I don't know like how many mistakes, how much room for mistakes is allowed like in this process, like um, or or it has to be perfect like 95% accurate every time in order for this to work perfectly. Um, yeah, so I guess, um, I don't have enough knowledge. There might be enough knowledge already, but if not, then I guess is there a way that we can perturb like um, these certain processes or something and then to see um, what would be required or necessary.",

Sorry, I had it backwards because the number was 25 and 29 is closer to 25 than 18. So, so just a small correction. So we have reporter and recorder. So, so Gulcin, I'm trying, I'm doing a little bit of recording here just to help you out to get it get things started, but you're going to take over all the recording. And Wenjing, and that's on the notes. And then Wenjing, you'll be the reporter with the PowerPoint. Is that, is that fair? Okay, report, no record. You're going to report and Gulcin is going to record. Does that make sense? Yes. Okay, sorry that I messed that up. So many variables. So, um, I think Wenjing and then the next person was Stefano, but I but the order is different, but I'll go with Stefano because I think you were the one who was second and then it'll be Judith.",

I guess I'm very interested at the question I would like to discuss is the the ultimate function when you want to build a tissue or an organism is that you have to have the right size and shape. And you know, I could imagine how self-organization can give rise to, you know, some pattern or some structure, but you know, are there going to be really principles or ways to think about how to link shape and function to what is the underlying self-organized mechanism? They're going to be rules one day that we can use to map one into the other.",
