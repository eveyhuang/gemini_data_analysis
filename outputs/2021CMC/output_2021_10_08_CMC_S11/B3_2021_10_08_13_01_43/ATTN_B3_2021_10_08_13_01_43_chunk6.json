How would modeling support the research in in these in this topic on this topic basically.",

There is also a whole problem of when you put together this sort of chemical model with mechanics and we have talked before about the mechanical state of cells and viscoelastic properties and stuff. So then it becomes a mechanochemical model and how chemistry influence mechanics and vice versa. There is also a lot of room for theory there I think.",

So so what how what's the right size? And is that does it depend on the on on the particular type of signal or the particular type of function or is there some invariance? And is that something that one could try to develop a statistical mechanical theory to develop what's the right size scale or what is sort of a a way of of of framing size? And you know to Gulcin's favorite question what is self you know in order to know self you need how how much how big is it when there'll be enough signal to be able to recognize itself as opposed to not being distinguishable from others. So there's also it may be nuanced by the fact that you need distinguishability. So does size matter? Simple question.",
