So my idea is like okay ion channels and so on they are the main signaling channels through in through which the cell communicates with the outside and then there are there has there is documented response to mechanical stress for example that stimulates activities within the cell. So and and I think electrical is is yet another one that's well that's how our brains function so it's",

Of course there's a molecular mechanisms for some protein either protein electrostatic ways. Um so I guess my my question is like um how how perfectly this process has to be. Um so there are chemical gradients that play a role as well like in that cause cell differentiation um therefore like um because like birth I I guess birth I I guess maybe like 50% of the baby more than 50% of babies that will be born correctly and uh so this process seems to be a really very um accurate process so um so right so so my question is just how much space of the error um is can be tolerated in the process and then the organism can still kind of self-adapt and self-correct um to a functional system.",

But that doesn't mean that you know it can fix error it just means they usually work right something that works well is already working well you don't know how you can fix mistakes because it's never making them.",

So now these two system are completely out of scale in timing wise right because one is going running hot and one is running cold and but eventually if you remove them after a few you leave them in this situation for a few hours and you take the embryo out then you get a fly. Right so so the embryo is somehow able to fix the asymmetry. It's unclear if there is a checkpoint where the embryo stops there and wait until it has fixed itself or if maybe the delay is slowly reabsorbed and so there's definitely I I think it's an interesting point that there's a great ability for the system to self-correct there is also though a great precision that is already built in. So so in a way probably the system is slightly over-engineered or more robust than it even needs to be. It tends to do things more accurately it doesn't do just just as accurately to get away with it.",

Yeah I guess one other point though that is worth mentioning is that you we as a species are really bad at this though right. It's it's estimated that as much as 30 or 40% of pregnancy fail right often without even realizing so.",

So maybe before we go to the next I mean I think that the there's going to be a question we should explore and I'm going to pick on Judith on this to start it off on measurement. But but before we get to measurement can we how do you all feel about the importance of self-organization and and the fidelity of self-organization is that an important driver or not? Do we need to understand self-organization to understand biology or self-organization in cells to understand cells or is it just completely random?",
