So the first thing that we have to do is identify who's going to be the speaker and who and and the the at the last session we actually had a person I mean the speaker would be the presenter. We actually found that having a presenter assigned that's the reporter and having a recorder assigned really helped to distribute the load. So I'm going to what I'm going to do is you're going to type in the chat box if you will a number between one and 100 and the person who gets closest to the the right answer they will be the reporter and the one who gets the second one is the recorder. So I don't know which is the preferred one because the last one the person who got the first one wanted to be the recorder not the reporter but anyway the closest to it will be the reporter and the second will be the recorder. And and to you know some people think oh I'll say 100 and then I'm going to be only half of it but I we we go around like a clock so so it's it's either way. So so that way it makes it even. So one two three four five six seven eight nine. Okay Catherine but you probably and we'll we'll see what happens. So and Joshua and Davide Davide symmetry broke from from Joshua. So I'm going to now turn on the my stopwatch and what I do just so you see this it's on right so it's just doing some arbitrary numbering and the last two digits is the one that of that number that's one that's really fast.

Okay and what we're going to do next now that we know who the reporter and the recorder are is just go around the room and make sure that everyone has an opportunity to say their name and your location. We almost all know who your name and your location is so just name and location and the next item will be a something interesting and different. And this interesting and different is because Romy stole my idea the last time of foods. So I'm going to riff on foods and say what is your favorite restaurant? So just what is your favorite restaurant and that favorite restaurant you'll have to at least tell us the city so we can maybe someday know to go to it. So your favorite restaurant and in in the city okay. And I'm going to type in the chat box the order that I see all of your faces so that way you'll know the order in which you're going to give this remark in. And so if you can see the chat the if you can see not the chat box sorry I'm putting it in the Google Doc.

So now these two system are completely out of scale in timing wise right because one is going running hot and one is running cold and but eventually if you remove them after a few you leave them in this situation for a few hours and you take the embryo out then you get a fly. Right so so the embryo is somehow able to fix the asymmetry. It's unclear if there is a checkpoint where the embryo stops there and wait until it has fixed itself or if maybe the delay is slowly reabsorbed and so there's definitely I I think it's an interesting point that there's a great ability for the system to self-correct there is also though a great precision that is already built in.

And the limitation also comes from the fact that you can't look at um the spatial and temporal changes of one molecule or two. Um but beyond that you know it's extremely hard to do from technical point of view technical difficulties. Also I I don't know a very effective way in fluorescence imaging that allow you to say you know this two these two signaling waves let's say they actually have some correlation rather than just coincidence.

Right? So so what how what's the right size? And is that does it depend on the on the particular type of signal, the particular type of function? Or is there some invariance? And is that something that one could try to develop a statistical mechanical theory to develop what's the right size scale or what is sort of a a way of of of framing size? And you know to for Gulchin's favorite question, what is self? You know in order to know self, you need how how much how big is it before there'll be enough signal to be able to recognize itself as opposed to not being distinguishable from others.

And I think Gulcin got really excited by this idea of of size mattering and self that of the observation of cells having a kind of a size and what is the hidden theory or the the sort of the hidden principle that has driven that size? Is it like it's like a scaling law almost. What is the scaling law for the size of scales of size of cells and is it somehow connected to signaling and self-organization? And I'm going to change that to scaling law. Physicists think of scaling laws as opposed to a scaling model in a very specific sense. I'm not I'm just pretending to be a physicist.",
