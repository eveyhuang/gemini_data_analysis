I'm very metal focused and I'm just curious as like what is a signal and are we measuring like what are we missing when we're focusing on the paradigms that exist for what signaling is. So one example is I study copper and copper is released during neurotransmission for example and it's released into the extracellular environment. We don't really understand what it's doing but I I have noticed that some people that are experts in signaling take issue if you call it a signaling molecule and instead say they they prefer if you say that it's mediating signaling it's not a signaling molecule. So I'm not sure if I really understand why that is but I also think that we might be just missing other things that are part of signaling.",

Is the signal a molecule? Is the signal a light? Is the signal a tickle? What is the object that is being that is the signal in the cell?
