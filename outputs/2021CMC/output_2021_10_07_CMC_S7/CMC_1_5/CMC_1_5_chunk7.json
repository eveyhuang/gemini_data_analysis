Once you have a free energy surface, you can do things with Markov state modeling to recover the kinetics out of it, which is all computational. But the free energy surface, this is arguably the third other method. You can always get free energy from simulations. How can you get free energy surfaces from experiments? With single molecule experiments you can do that. And I think from cryo-EM images, this is the other method where you can actually get an experimental free energy plot, so to speak. And then you can compare if your simulations are as good.",

So what and in fact variants of this have now started coming into cryoSPARC and RELION where they have they have something called 3D variational analysis which is like a PCA equivalent, like a linear approximation of these sort of dynamics. These have started right after the Nobel prize in cryo-EM, extracting dynamics from from data. So yeah we can this this we can look into. This is a this is a very I would say a problem that has gotten people thinking for the past five years.",

And broad-minded, not only good but broad-minded because often people sometimes feel like you know here is my structure and this is my you know this is my architecture, this thing never moves. That had been a huge amount of even early 2000s a lot of people would have felt like a like you know this thing is it's this which is that mindset is gone. And if anything AlphaFold will only kind of you know push that mindset like push that mindset aside I would say that yeah.",

So this was and of course now the thing is I I think I like thinking about this technology of Tesla inside a molecular dynamics simulation. I but then it's it's both a software and a hardware problem. So that's why it will take some time. Let me say I'll write a DP2 on this see if it flies or not. I haven't written that so and and but but yeah like again it's a it's a but there is a lot of machine learning I think everyone should have a computer science friend at this point of time that's the first thing. I think so that at least like you know now it's very easy like it's very difficult for me to read things so a friend tells me and educates me I learn things. So I think that's what is important everyone does that and to the extent of if you want to use it as dimensionality reduction we're in very good shape. Other things we have to we have to think about. Like yeah that I I don't know like I don't know where this thing is going like in NeurIPS or in this kind of conferences people people show a lot of in-principally correct but to transform them noise for example we have not even talked about noise. Data comes in with tons of noise. To to learn data actually is equivalent to is equivalent to unlearning noise. And real experimental data means like how would you unlearn noise? Like that in itself is what and that that's the point what what did PDB do for us? It removed all the noise over 30 years. That's what you were telling actually.",

Like I would love to be able to like you know say what in this big data set you know should I believe more seriously versus what's maybe more at the edge of noise and that I think is like probably it goes back I think to what we were saying which was you know having really good databases that are really well curated is like you know it's a beautiful thing for experimentalists and it's an even more beautiful thing for like machine learners to like you know how do we create those standards that everyone agree to that is sort of like this is like that level of quality and then and then when there is noise like what do you do with it?",

We have nine minutes and so Stephen has to sort of figure out what he wants to report out from this conversation. And the second thing is I'm concerned that we sort of have gotten into a a a naughty Nash equilibrium which is um that the only answer is we need more data and and and we need more computer time to analyze that data I mean to we need to be able to have enough machines to analyze that data etc. Could we have something more than just that we need more data or better data or or or better databases? I mean I I I think we've had lots of discussions where we had the possibility of of maybe a a different types of unknowns and maybe we could emphasize those as well.",

So that's why uh the essentially the training on the right image like the expected image comes in like if you have this pool of images when you train you discriminate between the image that is expected versus not expected. And then based on that and again the now the discrimination based on what features of that image that's where the problem comes in. The discrimination itself is there. So I would say if I have to like like if it's not structural data if it's I think pixels I think you know like the the intensity of of of color in a particular pixel is a very good indicator of training imaging data. So if we if we know that if we if we have real examples of a pixel by pixel intensity of a map then that can be learned very well.",

I think putting back a little more physics in the in the models uh allows us to simplify the models so instead of going super deep like three layers of or or deep neural networks you start thinking in terms of well I represent my data in a in a more efficient way and then I don't need uh three layers of neural network I may need to train only one or I may even do a I may even be uh good with a linear model and uh even though high dimensional and that's the way to go when you don't have enough data or you're not confident about the quality of your data.",
