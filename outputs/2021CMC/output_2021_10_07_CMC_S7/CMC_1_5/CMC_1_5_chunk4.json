And I'm going to stimulate them a little bit to answer to try to address the question. I know Davide has a lot of thoughts on this and maybe Lu or Cheemeng as well. So in this protein folding business, one question is if I have a structure or whatever, what's I mean if I have a sequence, what's the structure, etc. That's the sort of naive structural question which AlphaFold is answering. You could also do and people have been using machine learning, I mean neural nets to propagate structures. So you can demonstrate that you can at least with simple all-atom models, you can learn a little bit of how to propagate from knowing our existing trajectories and propagate them. So you might even be able to use an AI to propagate a large protein and to be an integrator. And what Abhishek has kind of suggested is maybe that's that's like the obvious thing for us to do. We have an integrator, let's make a better integrator that uses the machine that is faster. But is there a different way in which we could think about dynamics or what's happening between these two, knowing the sequence and knowing the structure that would give us more information or different information that would be a different question that we need to address. So I'm wondering what you all think about that and that's my and I picked on Davide and I warned him he was going to be the next person I was going to pick on.",

It doesn't scoop me. I'm not trying to fold anything. But I see this as an opportunity and I'm still thinking in terms of of what Rigoberto was saying. So this is a new set of tools that we can apply to answer more complex questions than just sequence versus structure. And one can go the the the next little step is to look at metastability and in in different environments because yeah, I mean you just don't have the protein in in a solvation box and that's it. I think in real life you you have different types of environments which probably affect the structure as well, partial folding or stuff like that. So that goes back to again using these tools with old tools like molecular dynamics but I'm still in the Boltzmann world. I haven't gotten out of it.",

It's not just the the water environment, what about the cellular environment, the crowding agents, the chaperones, stuff like that. Would I mean probably the training data will be hard to get, but then otherwise I think it will be a really powerful tool to use because from kind of the atomistic point of view, it will be really difficult to model. But then if we know the structures, like some of the structures, some of its dynamics, there may be ways to kind of propagate them into much longer time scales.",

So I think one key limitation is the the the quality and the completeness of the data provided for AlphaFold or for any you know any body to model per se. I think because of so many different factors involved that Lu mentioned like the environment and chaperone binding because I was working with Susan Lindquist on the protein folding before as well. So that's very important for the folding part and chaperone involvement. So all of that maybe not really in there when they were modeling all of these structures before. So I think all of that you know one one key thing that we got from this ISMB like International Society of Computational Biology meeting just last month was exactly this. So it's it's limited now by the kind of data available to us. So that's why we have always room to improve in the future to keep evolving all of that and the new generation of algorithms and data will be coming.",

So I think machine learning gives that gives that way of of figuring out the known unknowns when you're talking to experimentalists even beyond the physics models that we are often are so used to learning.
