A lot of people submit their molecular dynamics trajectories coarse grain simulations there and so you can benefit from it if yeah and this has of course gotten into a tendency of people actually skewing their data to look very good for the PDB sometimes at the cost of of of of compromising with the interpretation.

      "transcript": "I think that is simple in part that is simple. I think that that is what we have understood. Uh like essentially uh uh given a training set there are cross validation methods that can be used to check how good the quality of learning is. Uh what I find difficult is uh how do I validate generation uh things that I have not learned in the training set. For example in the in the uh in the spike work that Rommie did they actually with Arvind uh they actually did uh went into a reduced space found some new confirmations that were not in the training set but that had to be validated which they did actually separately. Uh uh so something like that will have to be uh uh will have to be thought of number one. So I think uh how do we how do we validate generated models uh that's one point. And again when it's dynamics I would I would uh uh like to stress a bit the predictions that we were talking about Rigoberto they were what you call non non-generative models where you actually have to guide dynamics with dynamics to get the future. Uh essentially can we uh uh have generative dynamics like where we don't uh essentially feed the answer to get another variant of that answer where we start out with uh some sort of constraints and allow the the the model to to generate all sorts of answers and then validate it. So I think that's where uh uh I would I would the training problem is not I think the bottleneck is the training problem is how you train things. That depends on interpretation. Uh given a data uh uh let's say coordinate a molecule how do I tell a computer that it's a molecule? Do I give it all atom coordinates? Do I give it the dihedral angles? Do I give it the bonds and the angles? Do I give it like what what feature feature selection. I think training is a simple process as long as we know uh what feature do we choose. I think that's where most of the intelligence goes in of a of a researcher is what feature to choose. Uh uh I think that is one place and then once the training is done what do I do with the trained set? If I end up getting back the same training set I haven't done anything like essentially I haven't discovered anything. So how do we get to the known unknowns? Uh the known unknowns are good because we know that we have expectations so there is a there's a validation for that uh that we know. And then more importantly when we go to unknown unknowns uh how do we validate the unknown unknowns? So I that's I was just trying to frame the question uh that uh it's a question of training and generation. So in the training how do we how do we train like what is the channel of training? Uh how good an an educator am I? That's the question that I often ask when I think of training something. How good of an educator am I? Like when I write an equation on a board how do I teach my students that? So it's uh so that that that is exactly the problem uh I I I face all the time. Uh if there are any thoughts about it then I would be very and then once I've trained it I find okay the students have learned exactly what I have given them how would they uh how would they uh overcome my limitations? I have uh not found the first answer is possibly people have thought about it the second answer I have not uh not found in any way. How does the how do I get out of the training set in a credible way? There are so many ways in which I can get out of the training set and it's not credible enough. I can even train my program to say don't predict in the training set go outside. But then what I am getting how good is that? That problem I'm not.",

So I think there's no way that we can change the data quality if we don't know anything about them. So I think the only way that typically we do I think as as a field in general is to cross validate using an independent data set or independent cohort of patients of something of totally independent done from a different institution or university.",

So the it's an open question I don't know how to answer that but can we use a combination of molecular modeling traditional MD and and uh machine learning techniques which is very vague at the moment to uh design a mesoscale system which does what we want it to do which has the properties that we want it to have. Um then you can think about any any kind of problem I'm more into in like energy materials or or stuff like that. But we are trying to go towards something that is not like the five atoms per cell that uh we used to deal with in material science. And uh",
