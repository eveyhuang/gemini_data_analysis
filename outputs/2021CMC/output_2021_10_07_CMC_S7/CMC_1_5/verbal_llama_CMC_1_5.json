It doesn't it just barely shows you your car in in the image. And as it learns and gets feedback from the things it's seeing, it starts to realize that for your particular implementation of your car where your cameras are, how to triangulate and know exactly where an object is. So the objects start to appear in the first 100,000 and 2,000 miles that you're driving your car as it learns for your particular implementation.

I think that in terms of the concern, I think that when people say like the protein folding problem, it's actually kind of like a semantic issue where like there really isn't one protein folding problem. I think when Christian Anfinsen kind of first used that phrase, he did in Google's defense, he did actually use it to mean structure prediction. Of course, like what's happened over the last four or five decades is that we now know that protein folding is interesting for many other reasons other than being able to potentially predict structures. And so I think the term has kind of taken on more meanings than it originally had when it was first articulated. So that was just something I kind of wanted to clarify on. But I mean, just to kind of like update a little bit because this is a space that we do a lot of reading and thinking on, they just came out with a preprint two or three days ago to predict complexes as well, like multimers, which apparently works pretty well. So it's pretty remarkable the rate of progress. ",

So exactly when first came out AlphaFold, the first question is can they really predict protein-protein interaction interfaces? The answer is no. And that's okay. And then when you were talking to people more and more, there are many things that AlphaFold didn't really yet produce and generate for us. Yes, it's a very amazing platform, there are no doubts. So we came up with this paper like almost like 10 years ago. So that was the first time when people predict that the protein interaction network generated by computational prediction can be of even higher quality compared to experimentally generated data set. They have proof of that, they have evidence, they have a lot of things, and it was really high quality and things that a lot of times because of experimental failures, noise, batch effect and all of that. So apparently, of course, you cannot really compare to a carefully designed computational algorithm. So definitely see a huge application and potential that we can benefit from AlphaFold. But at the same time, as Stephen Fried just mentioned now, that a couple of days ago, maybe last month, this new paper came out saying that hey, they were able to modify this algorithm to predict protein-protein interaction complexes. And my student has been working on that to see if we can benefit by integrating with PDB that I know Abhishek has been has mentioned there too, to see if you can somehow use the prediction to broad extend to many different protein interactions and then figure out, I think the key thing that we want to do is to see the mutational effect, how that localized to the protein structure, the interaction interface. AlphaFold is perfect, you know, in that regard. We can we can really leverage that information and then model our network to really generate potential effect of mutations and then maybe also model a patient level where you have a set of five, six driver mutations, combination of them, what will be the effect. I think it's just the beginning of many exciting things. ",

So like if you have like let's say a protein that you know, there is a mutation that causes a disease and the main way that that mutation causes the disease is by destabilizing the protein to the point that it doesn't properly fold or gets degraded or something to that effect. So am I understanding you properly and what you're saying that you think that if you then typed into AlphaFold, you know, here's the exact same sequence, I'm just going to mutate this one phenylalanine to a valine, that it would then properly predict that the whole thing falls apart?

But actually, for people who are very familiar with PDB, I think Abhishek may know this more than me, you're able to do generate a score, a quantitative score that compare the sequence similarity and sequence or structural similarity or structural differences. You know, when you rotate the structure from the current position 90 degrees rotating, you say this is different. No, they are the same. So you have to have a way to quantify. So there is a way that we can somehow see that single point mutation can really do generate the structural differences. I think you can look at that more for structural differences, folding and other things. We we just started, but I think there are for sure some interesting things that AlphaFold can offer even in terms of protein folding too. At least we can see some sort of thing on the protein surfaces because we are interested more in interactions. And then you see some sort of structural surface changes obviously. And then by the structural alignment score, you can say yes, it is really a real change. ",

        "utterance": "Abhishek SINGHAROY: I have very strong feelings on AlphaFold. It's fantastic actually, it's very, very good. So actually, my feeling is a bit different. I would not like to think about the 10 years in future with AlphaFold. I would like to think about the 10 years in future with Google, with what the CEO of Google is thinking might be potentially once he has gotten AlphaFold out. So now if we think in that direction, where did AlphaFold come from? The reason we really like this because we essentially have a statistical mechanics kind of a mindset which really, really kind of gets us into neural networks and and this sort of a multi-sequence alignment. So essentially as a community, we were already highly biased on which this 500 million dollars investment is now being, it's a we are the return on investment. So in a way, that's my way of thinking. Now, let's think from a different side. Where did machine learning the way we are thinking over the last five years come from? The first wave was in 1960s where already Boltzmann motors, not Boltzmann generator, but Boltzmann motors were generated. There's a second wave in 1980s and this is the third wave of machine learning holding the hands of GPUs. So from where I like to think is algorithms biology. There are seven different entry points of machine learning. Anything and everything that we are doing right now is the machine learning of neural networks, brain. How does the brain work? That is one way and what we are trying to do is we are trying to cast all our problems essentially in terms of how our brain thinks. There are six other ways. I've forgotten the names of the six others. One of them is quorum sensing. There are, if you review, there are reviews in algorithms biology. Of these seven ways, three of them doesn't even have mathematical theorems derived, let go of, it hasn't even reached computer science. It's in the applied math level. So I think of machine learning, it's heavily biased by our interpretation of things. It's a virtual machine. So our interpretation is statistical mechanical, which goes very nicely with this neural gas and and so this this is very, very good. And therefore, okay, now now coming down to to AlphaFold, I think therefore the next, if we follow this track, I would invite everyone to look into the six other tracks. But if we follow this track, I think can we can we look into dynamics, which is what I am very, very interested in. In fact, if you go to AlphaFold, they have a similar kind of work on dynamics on the website. They have been only able to train on three particle dynamics. They haven't been able to go beyond that. And not only that, one thing we forget, the training happens on TPUs, not GPUs, very, very highly sophisticated hardware which is not available on any public supercomputer in the country. It's only available with as a part of Google Colab, otherwise not. So I think dynamics would be extremely important to learn. The question is, should we learn dynamics with neural networks, with the way we are thinking about our brain thinks about things? Is that the ansatz to follow? Or should we think of other ways of machine learning altogether? And I think that's where I think we we need to as biologists, we can contribute because we know from from this biological side, how does nature use seven algorithms? If we can treat this problem these seven algorithms that way, then possibly it's going to be easier. I know the reason of doing neural networks, LSTMs, GANs, the different kinds of objects, also because now they are available. There's a lot of implementation, but can we think of it beyond that? I would say that... ",

And I'm going to stimulate them a little bit to answer to try to address the question. I know Davide has a lot of thoughts on this and maybe Lu or Cheemeng as well. So in this protein folding business, one question is if I have a structure or whatever, what's I mean if I have a sequence, what's the structure, etc. That's the sort of naive structural question which AlphaFold is answering. You could also do and people have been using machine learning, I mean neural nets to propagate structures. So you can demonstrate that you can at least with simple all-atom models, you can learn a little bit of how to propagate from knowing our existing trajectories and propagate them. So you might even be able to use an AI to propagate a large protein and to be an integrator. And what Abhishek has kind of suggested is maybe that's that's like the obvious thing for us to do. We have an integrator, let's make a better integrator that uses the machine that is faster. But is there a different way in which we could think about dynamics or what's happening between these two, knowing the sequence and knowing the structure that would give us more information or different information that would be a different question that we need to address. So I'm wondering what you all think about that and that's my and I picked on Davide and I warned him he was going to be the next person I was going to pick on. ",

And one can go the the the next little step is to look at metastability and in in different environments because yeah, I mean you just don't have the protein in in a solvation box and that's it. I think in real life you you have different types of environments which probably affect the structure as well, partial folding or stuff like that. So that goes back to again using these tools with old tools like molecular dynamics but I'm still in the Boltzmann world. I haven't gotten out of it. ",

        "utterance": "Abhishek SINGHAROY: I think that is simple in part that is simple. I think that that is what we have understood. like essentially given a training set there are cross validation methods that can be used to check how good the quality of learning is. What I find difficult is how do I validate generation things that I have not learned in the training set. For example in the in the spike work that Rommie did they actually with Arvind they actually did went into a reduced space found some new confirmations that were not in the training set but that had to be validated which they did actually separately. so something like that will have to be will have to be thought of number one. So I think how do we how do we validate generated models that's one point. And again when it's dynamics I would I would like to stress a bit the predictions that we were talking about Rigoberto they were what you call non non-generative models where you actually have to guide dynamics with dynamics to get the future. essentially can we have generative dynamics like where we don't essentially feed the answer to get another variant of that answer where we start out with some sort of constraints and allow the the the model to to generate all sorts of answers and then validate it. So I think that's where I would I would the training problem is not I think the bottleneck is the training problem is how you train things. That depends on interpretation. given a data let's say coordinate a molecule how do I tell a computer that it's a molecule? Do I give it all atom coordinates? Do I give it the dihedral angles? Do I give it the bonds and the angles? Do I give it like what what feature feature selection. I think training is a simple process as long as we know what feature do we choose. I think that's where most of the intelligence goes in of a of a researcher is what feature to choose. I think that is one place and then once the training is done what do I do with the trained set? If I end up getting back the same training set I haven't done anything like essentially I haven't discovered anything. So how do we get to the known unknowns? The known unknowns are good because we know that we have expectations so there is a there's a validation for that that we know. And then more importantly when we go to unknown unknowns how do we validate the unknown unknowns? So I that's I was just trying to frame the question that it's a question of training and generation. So in the training how do we how do we train like what is the channel of training? How good an educator am I? That's the question that I often ask when I think of training something. How good of an educator am I? Like when I write an equation on a board how do I teach my students that? So it's so that that that is exactly the problem I I I face all the time. if there are any thoughts about it then I would be very and then once I've trained it I find okay the students have learned exactly what I have given them. How would they how would they overcome my limitations? I have not found the first answer is possibly people have thought about it the second answer I have not not found in any way. How does the how do I get out of the training set in a credible way? There are so many ways in which I can get out of the training set and it's not credible enough. I can even train my program to say don't predict in the training set go outside but then what I am getting how good is that that problem I'm not...

Data comes in with tons of noise. To to learn data actually is equivalent to is equivalent to unlearning noise. And real experimental data means like how would you unlearn noise?
