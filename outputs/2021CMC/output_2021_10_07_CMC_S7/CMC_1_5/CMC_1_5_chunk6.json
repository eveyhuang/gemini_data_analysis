            "transcript": "I think that is simple in part that is simple. I think that that is what we have understood. like essentially given a training set there are cross validation methods that can be used to check how good the quality of learning is. What I find difficult is how do I validate generation things that I have not learned in the training set. For example in the in the spike work that Rommie did they actually with Arvind they actually did went into a reduced space found some new confirmations that were not in the training set but that had to be validated which they did actually separately. so something like that will have to be will have to be thought of number one. So I think how do we how do we validate generated models that's one point. And again when it's dynamics I would I would like to stress a bit the predictions that we were talking about Rigoberto they were what you call non non-generative models where you actually have to guide dynamics with dynamics to get the future. essentially can we have generative dynamics like where we don't essentially feed the answer to get another variant of that answer where we start out with some sort of constraints and allow the the the model to to generate all sorts of answers and then validate it. So I think that's where I would I would the training problem is not I think the bottleneck is the training problem is how you train things. That depends on interpretation. given a data let's say coordinate a molecule how do I tell a computer that it's a molecule? Do I give it all atom coordinates? Do I give it the dihedral angles? Do I give it the bonds and the angles? Do I give it like what what feature feature selection. I think training is a simple process as long as we know what feature do we choose. I think that's where most of the intelligence goes in of a of a researcher is what feature to choose. I think that is one place and then once the training is done what do I do with the trained set? If I end up getting back the same training set I haven't done anything like essentially I haven't discovered anything. So how do we get to the known unknowns? The known unknowns are good because we know that we have expectations so there is a there's a validation for that that we know. And then more importantly when we go to unknown unknowns how do we validate the unknown unknowns? So I that's I was just trying to frame the question that it's a question of training and generation. So in the training how do we how do we train like what is the channel of training? How good an educator am I? That's the question that I often ask when I think of training something. How good of an educator am I? Like when I write an equation on a board how do I teach my students that? So it's so that that that is exactly the problem I I I face all the time. if there are any thoughts about it then I would be very and then once I've trained it I find okay the students have learned exactly what I have given them. How would they how would they overcome my limitations? I have not found the first answer is possibly people have thought about it the second answer I have not not found in any way. How does the how do I get out of the training set in a credible way? There are so many ways in which I can get out of the training set and it's not credible enough. I can even train my program to say don't predict in the training set go outside but then what I am getting how good is that that problem I'm not... That's that's explored that area is like the time part is still physics is needed to recover the time. Rommie knows so her in her Nature Chem paper she had Abbas, Armask and and Joachim Frank who pioneered this method back in 2014 already how can you extract dynamics from 2D data. You can use that as an ensemble essentially your your data is like a molecular dynamics ensemble not but that it's not molecular dynamics because it's 2D projections but you actually have an ensemble you basically have thousands of those images. How can you learn from them and reconstruct what you call a minimum free energy pathway is is is there like the tool is called manifold EM and if you want a potential energy minimizing version of that not free energy it's called Polaris. So so people have actually worked on it and done pretty complicated problems. The time aspect of course cannot be they don't have any idea of kinetics that's where kinetic modeling comes in as an as an after what I am getting how good is that that problem I'm not",
