So obtaining learning how it does it, what so I think is part of the problem and many people said it in one way or the other. So if you could capture somehow this inversion or this developing rules that the machine you learned answers but can you also learn rules?",

And I think one way people have tried it is by introducing perturbations to that inversion and seeing the responses to that perturbation and seeing how it moves forward. That was that's that's one like you know common way of of learning from inversion. Like give perturbations and see how does the inversion learn the perturbations.",
