And that was really interesting when I reviewed their program because they all start with format. So they assume this, like they're going to get CO2, electrochemist will get CO2 from biorefinery, which is the cheapest CO2 and pure CO2 you can get because what do you get is wet CO2, you just need to remove water if you need to.
