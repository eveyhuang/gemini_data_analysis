            "transcript": "like CO2 reduction into elementary steps and for each elementary step they calculate the like energy difference between the products and the reactants and from there you can get some uh you can say whether the step is uphill or downhill and how uphill or downhill it is and then you can identify so called potential limiting step and then you can compare different catalysts and see which one has the like least potential limiting step and therefore the best uh catalytic activity. But but but this is just thermodynamics uh and as you just mentioned the kinetic information is is actually much more relevant to the uh reaction rate. So and when we consider the uh if you want to model the kinetics then it's very critical to consider the effect of the electrons and also effects of the salvation all these things become matter and um so I I I will give one example. So so for example I studied the single metal atom single nickel atom in nitrogen for CO2 reduction. So this catalyst has a very high selectivity and also activity for CO2 reduction to CO. But if you just look at the thermodynamics you will find that the hydrogen evolution reaction which is a side reaction is actually much more favorable than CO2 reduction which contradicts with the experimental finding that the hydrogen evolution is very uh very little for such catalyst. So this is because um like the salvation uh uh factor. So uh so so when we come this chemically unsolved CO2 and this CO2 can get some negative charge from the uh from catalyst then the negative charge CO2 can have the can form the hydrogen bonding with the with the water which it's kind of similar to the uh quantum effects that uh was mentioned uh previously. Uh but but if you just have hydrogen unsolved on the side the hydrogen would not be much negatively charged so you do not have such contribution from the hydrogen bond to stabilize the intermediate. So this salvation um will steer the pathway into CO2 reduction instead of hydrogen evolution reaction. Yes, so this is just one example to show it's important to consider I would say it's micro environment instead of just salvation. Um and also the kinetic um parameters or not sometimes reaction um is thermodynamically favorable but it's just kinetically not favorable. We also see it in uh in in in several uh situations. Yeah, I guess another critical factor which I find uh important and maybe overlooked uh in some sense is that the charge capacity of the catalyst or the site. If you could accumulate more electrons on the catalytic site then that would in general uh lowers the barrier for the electrochemical reduction and good for uh catalysis as well. So",
