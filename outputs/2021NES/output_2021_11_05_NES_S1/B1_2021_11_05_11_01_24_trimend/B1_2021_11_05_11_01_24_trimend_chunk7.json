So these are some some of the fundamental problem of the theory. So we hope like we can get better model to do that. And the other thing I want to say a little bit about experimental study which I collaborate with those people in in Germany and the paper will come out this week. So they actually use some I don't know the details though, but I know they use some terahertz spectroscopy. So they can see what's going on exactly on surface. We test a very simple system with a sodium chloride, they looks like sodium chloride, they found that they behave differently with water. But I I don't know if anyone of you have used that method and how it can be used to understand the surface structure.",

So Venkat, we have you here. I think I put that prompt in for you. So you want to tell us a little bit about what your thoughts are on that.

Obviously, CO2 reduction is one of those challenging problems where you have multiple products, right? And uh delineating those products has been quite tricky. Uh, so I think there machine learning could probably give you additional tools uh to analyze uh even deconvolve uh whatever kinds of measurements you're you're you're trying to fuse together, right? So it's an information fusion problem. You have uh your voltammetric signals uh and then maybe you do some other product measurements of, you know, in various ways. So I think there there's a lot of opportunity for machine learning. Uh, I think there's obviously a lot of opportunity for automation, automated experiments also. I I sort of put both of that in the same bucket. I think automated experiments uh automated there's now lots of very good electric automated electrochemical apparatus apparatus that you can buy.",
