Um, and talking about how much is this and I know Richard said they're also interested in in neutral, but what really would be a negative emissions technology, not just a neutral emissions technology. I personally don't know why neutral emissions is a bad thing. I feel like the circular plastics economy idea has really picked up and everyone's on board with that, but we skipped that for emissions. We said no, we already have to go negative just because we're so far in the red right now. Um, but yeah, so I think these right these are all steps so I don't want to throw away any of the ideas, but I do think if you're talking about scale, I think putting it into building materials or burying electrochemically or whatever produced our own chunks of solid coal carbon back in the ground might be where we have to go if we're really going to have that large of a sink.",
