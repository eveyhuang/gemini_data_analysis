And um so I want ask you guys opinion on that paper uh especially uh if I looking uh the the the mechanism part with the paper, they basically claim that the role of is that it can stabilize the chemically unsoluble CO2. So the chemically unsoluble CO2 has some negative charge uh and if there is a then the electrostatic interaction can stabilize.",
