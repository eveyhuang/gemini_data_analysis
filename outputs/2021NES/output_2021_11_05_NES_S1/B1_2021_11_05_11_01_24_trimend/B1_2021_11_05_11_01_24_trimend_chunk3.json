And talking about how much is this, and I know Richard said they're also interested in in neutral, but what really would be a negative emissions technology, not just a neutral emissions technology. I personally don't know why neutral emissions is a bad thing. I feel like the circular plastics economy idea has really picked up and everyone's on board with that, but we skipped that for emissions. We said, no, we already have to go negative just because we're so far in the red right now. But yeah, so I think these, right, these are all steps, so I don't want to throw away any of the ideas, but I do think if you're talking about scale, I think putting it into building materials or burying electrochemically or whatever produced our own chunks of solid coal carbon back in the ground might be where we have to go if we're really going to have that large of a sink.",

Like if if you can take part of the CO2 to make a feed, it doesn't matter if it's on scale. If you would produce that by a by means that would produce more CO2, clearly this technology would contribute to to negative emission even though you're making a new carbon product from it. So, we need like a massive scale option and maybe it is concrete, although there are lots of human rights issues with concrete too. But anyways, but there's also, but yeah, we so carbon, right, so CO2 to carbon. Should I add this to the to the notes for like a high scale?",

Baroness Brown last year had a really great, you know, plenary talk, right? And she talked about like what's a reasonable price for burying carbon.
