But if you co-locate the conversion with the capture, now you have to tell capture people what is your criteria, what your feed stock should look like. And if you look at there's a lot of funding went into national labs from BTO, Bioenergy Technology Office, and they always assume that they're going to upgrade whatever electrochemical people produced biologically. And that was really interesting when I reviewed their program because they all start with formate. So they assume this, like they're going to get CO2, electrochemists will get CO2 from biorefinery which is the cheapest CO2 and pure CO2 you can get because what you get is a wet CO2, you just need to remove water if you need to. So that's the like purest and easiest CO2 to get at this time. And then they say, okay, the older electrochemists will give me formate and that's where they started. Is it right assumption? I don't know, right? And they are saying biological pathway from formate to larger molecule is easier than electrochemistry from CO2 to larger molecule. Question.",

But but but this is just thermodynamics uh and as you just mentioned the kinetic information is is actually much more relevant to the uh reaction rate. So and when we consider the uh if you want to model the kinetics then it's very critical to consider the effect of the electrons and also effects of the salvation all these things become matter and um so I I I will give one example. So so for example I studied the single metal atom single nickel atom in nitrogen for CO2 reduction. So this catalyst has a very high selectivity and also activity for CO2 reduction to CO. But if you just look at the thermodynamics you will find that the hydrogen evolution reaction which is a side reaction is actually much more favorable than CO2 reduction which contradicts with the experimental finding that the hydrogen evolution is very uh very little for such catalyst. So this is because um like the salvation uh uh factor. So uh so so when we come this chemically unsolved CO2 and this CO2 can get some negative charge from the uh from catalyst then the negative charge CO2 can have the can form the hydrogen bonding with the with the water which it's kind of similar to the uh quantum effects that uh was mentioned uh previously. Uh but but if you just have hydrogen unsolved on the side the hydrogen would not be much negatively charged so you do not have such contribution from the hydrogen bond to stabilize the intermediate. So this salvation um will steer the pathway into CO2 reduction instead of hydrogen evolution reaction. Yes, so this is just one example to show it's important to consider I would say it's micro environment instead of just salvation. Um and also the kinetic um parameters or not sometimes reaction um is thermodynamically favorable but it's just kinetically not favorable. We also see it in uh in in in several uh situations. Yeah, I guess another critical factor which I find uh important and maybe overlooked uh in some sense is that the charge capacity of the catalyst or the site. If you could accumulate more electrons on the catalytic site then that would in general uh lowers the barrier for the electrochemical reduction and good for uh catalysis as well. So",

And the other thing I want to say a little bit about experimental study which I collaborate with those people in in Germany and the paper will come out this week. So they actually use some I don't know the details though, but I know they use some terahertz spectroscopy. So they can see what's going on exactly on surface.

So as part of the first year of the C look, we have developed a gas tight rotating cylinder electrode cell where we put the model uh copper polyline copper electrode and we rotate it at different uh rates. And as you rotate it, even though you have the same potential, you actually start to see dramatic changes in in selectivity. We already also we have the preprint in in our website. So what we see is that actually mass transport control selectivity and the the the problem is a little bit more complex. So you actually have a lot of uh CO that is a main reaction intermediate that dissolves and hangs around near the surface of the electrode long enough. So at the the near the surface of the electrode it actually behaves as a sort of CSTR, a continuous stirred tank reactor and then uh what happens is that we get a lot of high uh conversion of CO and uh theory is trying to do a lot of mechanistic understanding of of those systems actually on under high uh conversion of CO and uh typically you don't study kinetics under those conditions, right? Uh but now that I think we have a good uh system, right? Uh uh a reactor that you can control mass transport and and see the influence of mass transport in electrocatalysis, I think uh now what we see is that we can actually understand the the mechanism of CO2 reduction on copper uh much easily.

Uh and perhaps you can take some of that understanding and translate that for CO2 capture as well from diverse set of um emissions.

We also think that understanding durability, economic costs and incentive structures are crucial under real world operating conditions and this actually goes back to the point that uh Carlos had made about uh the need for molecular scale science as well as the process scale engineering to come together to inform economic costs and incentive structure incentive structures.

This is something that's going to get realized over the course of the next 10 to 20 years or so. So in this context of defossilization, what is going to be the emerging role of DAC and CO2 capture? It's an open ended question but that is where we choose to wrap up our discussion. So thank you for the opportunity to present.",

Um uh I think the previous group kind of articulated that uh there's opportunity for DAC to be um uh operate uh independent of point of source um applications. Um one of the things that was a pretty like well established thought process that we talked in great detail was um the value proposition of combining point of source um treatment with DAC. Um given the fact that a lot of the infrastructure can be repurposed um and having that onsite is going to be potentially an economic advantage for that approach. Um we talked a lot about Zorbins, um uh just we talked about Ecam, electrochemistry and Zorbins. Um most of our discussion was on Zorbins with a little bit of echem at the end, but from the Zorbins we talked about it'd be nice to have a singular Zorbint that operated um across various concentrations so you could um have it um very versatile in terms of operating with point of source as well as direct air capture and both of those applications where you have concentrations. We talked about the challenges again with different properties based off of geographic locations and why that might be a more of a challenge to have a singular um Zorbint. Um we talked about uh again, larger scale issues um in terms of treatment trains, um whether we want to integrate um direct air capture with point of source or we want to combine those um to produce um uh you know, fuels or integrate it with conversion applications. Um how we integrate multiple technologies is going to be a um energy systems level challenge. Um we also talked a little bit about uh kind of how we can innovative ways for um integrating direct air capture. There was a lot of discussion on um transportation um areas like planes, submarines, spacecraft, things where we have a lot of moving parts already and how can we potentially utilize these systems that have existing infrastructure that would be valuable for DAC um as a way to um excentuate DAC as it exists. Um given that the fossil fuel and DOE announced today the earth shot for $100 um per ton for DAC. Um we talked about what are pathways toward that goal. Um whether the innovation um and advancement in science and new technology will get us there. Um some of the thoughts were really about how we can just use repurposing um and potentially the less glamorous um approach of like how can we take um abandoned coal mines or abandoned infrastructure and repurpose that for DAC systems may be the fastest way to getting to that goal. Um however ambitious that is because most um DAC is around 300 to $500 currently. Um we briefly talked about policy um and uh the different opportunities and there was an a one cited evidence of of a uh positive policy um or mutualistically positive policy um where farmers if we're thinking about um carbon um capture in soils, um there's mutualistic benefit to the farmer for soil health and different ways that we can inter um interject policy to um accelerate the adoption of DAC. Um and lastly, we ended our conversation not to um let electrochemistry um not hit the stage a little bit about really um the versatility of electrochemical systems for carbon capture and carbon conversion. Um but other than that, I think that's really covers what we discussed.",

        "transcript": "our discussion and so um so we're talking about materials for separation and storage and uh we talked a lot about the challenges for materials discovery and development and I think some of these um are continuing on some themes that were discussed in other groups. So gaps between computational predictions and experiments, the fact that like if um you know if a computational study identifies a new material that might be um advantageous for uh separation or storage application, it takes time to actually synthesize that material or it might not be possible to synthesize that material. So um taking feasibility into account when doing these um these uh sort of computational uh predictions. Um we also I uh identified the the need for training sets for machine learning approaches. So um uh sufficient characterization data under the dynamic operating conditions that a lot of these um sorbents uh work under um is needed uh for for this. Um we also talked about some of the challenges with scale up so so lab scale experiments and synthesis versus application scale. Um so things that you consider to be in operando on the lab scale might not truly represent your application scale um conditions. I think this was touched on in some other groups. Um so degradation processes and reversibility or cyclability issues for the um the sorbents that you know adsorb and then we want to release the CO2 at like the storage or conversion um area. A lot of these sorbents function at non equilibrium conditions so might eventually break down. Um some of these degradation products might be sort of the active materials in the storage or catalysis that you're doing. Um and then I think this point kind of goes back into the modeling where we need to understand what the uncertainties are in the model uh uh predictions in order to um you know apply them in a useful way. Also interfaces are key in these uh sort of material applications but hard to understand. So interfaces is where most of the action happens but it's it's all these complex processes occur. The interfacial structure is dynamic and different than bulk structure and therefore hard to characterize. Um we also talked about some underexplored sort of physical phenomena related to um CO2 separation and storage um in this uh sort of the area of sorbents. We talked about light or using light or electrochemistry or humidity swings to trigger desorption might be sort of new um axes to think about um in this context. Um for storage, we talked about CO2 mineralization and some physical phenomena that needed to kind of understand or accelerate that process um or better understandings of precipitation and dissolution dissolution phenomena both sort of solid liquid so at the solid liquid um interface when you're um sort of forming these sort of solid minerals and at the liquid gas interface when you're actually dissolving CO2 into your liquid um sorbent. We also talked about um some interesting ideas about mining coupling mineralization with mining of valuable elements. And then finally we talked about some design criteria to keep in mind when when thinking about these things. So thermal conductivity especially if um you know the heats of adsorption and desorption are playing a role in the sorbents, electrical conductivity for the electrochemical materials, transparency if we're talking about using uh light as a trigger. Um materials that can accommodate self healing or assisted healing processes. Um and then just taking a lot of knowledge from the catalysis community um that they've developed about um adsorption and desorption and sort of balancing the energetics of those two processes and to inform the design of materials for um I think thinking about sorbents again in this case. So I think that sums up a lot of what we talked about.",

Um I go by Leslie which is my middle name and I'm assistant professor at UC Riverside and I'm thankful for the conversations that we had um with our participants and the facilitator Jordy and George. Um so we talked about methane capture and valorization and one of the initial um starts of the conversation was what are the potential emitters or missions. Um and so we're thinking agricultural sites, um fossil fuels of course is a major emitter. Um but then also we have methane in the atmosphere. And so is it really conducive to uh try to capture um if we're going for negative emissions methane out of the atmosphere and you know how would that work? Will we work from point sources or do we work from dilute sources. And um it seems like we had agreement that maybe point sources would be the best option. However, um even if we try to um develop some sort of technology that can take methane from these point sources, they're actually pretty dilute in terms of they have a lot of variability um where you can have a few PPMs of methane to hundreds of PPM um for example at agricultural sources. And then there's other mediations um for removing methane um of for example from cows and that's changing their diets and and um other technological innovations like having them wear a mask or something. Um but if we talk about uh developing technological solutions that we can eventually implement here with the um people that are within this group, um we talked about a lot of different things and I say that you can probably divide it into three. So it's leaving the chemistry of methane alone, the molecule which is naturally nonpolar and then doing something with that maybe changing the pressure or temperature to try to store it. Um the second is trying to make it more reactive. And so we talked about the idea of reactive capture. And then the last thing um is actually taking inspiration from nature so using microbes. And so um the I'll go along this list of possible solutions. One of the first ones was why don't we just oxidize methane all the way to CO2. Um and even though it sounds like it might be counter intuitive, we could potentially possibly integrate this in direct air capture um technology.",
