But if you co-locate the conversion with the capture, now you have to tell capture people what is your criteria, what your feed stock should look like. And if you look at there's a lot of funding went into national labs from BTO, Bioenergy Technology Office, and they always assume that they're going to upgrade whatever electrochemical people produced biologically. And that was really interesting when I reviewed their program because they all start with formate. So they assume this, like they're going to get CO2, electrochemists will get CO2 from biorefinery which is the cheapest CO2 and pure CO2 you can get because what you get is a wet CO2, you just need to remove water if you need to. So that's the like purest and easiest CO2 to get at this time. And then they say, okay, the older electrochemists will give me formate and that's where they started. Is it right assumption? I don't know, right? And they are saying biological pathway from formate to larger molecule is easier than electrochemistry from CO2 to larger molecule. Question.",

So there's a thermal catalytic route already kind of established for that and we have some discussions about thermal versus electrocatalysis yesterday.

One I think one product I would like is ethylene carbonate which because we have a massive amount of ethylene carbonate need coming for lithium ion battery electrolytes, right? So there's you know if you look at the the projections, right, if you want a terawatt hour capacity that is needed by 2030 for EVs, right? It's massive need for for ethylene carbonate and if you look at the process emissions of a lithium ion battery, right, it's it's for every kilowatt hour the total emissions is like 60 kilowatt hour, right? So so with an EV, right, you have about three years of like actual driving before you get to sort of net net benefit versus an internal combustion engine and of course the larger the vehicle once the Rivians and the Fords start start selling pickup trucks the the the sort of neutral period goes much longer. So I think",
