Let's have our our second breakout of the Scialog. I am going to start with a few logistics. I think at this point, you've done it once, so you know how we're rolling, but just in case. They have posted we're we're session 2.6 and if you go to the Scialog folder, let me move this. You will see that this is the facilitator folder, it always takes a while for the actual folder to load. But you should see a Google Doc for rough notes and then the slide that we can complete or that you're going to want to complete for the report out. Oh of course now it's taking a while to load. But anyway, everything gets done on Drive and therefore the documentation, you know, it's easy where to put it. Okay, so now I got it. So you go to virtual meeting materials, you'll see the rough notes for 2.6. So that's a Word document and if you go to the main folder, there's the Scialog meeting slides, which is the central slide deck and that's where we will or where you will add your contribution for 2.6, which is on slide, let's see, 40.

Like it's usually got to be quite a bit hotter and we don't want to be putting that kind of heat into higher atmosphere. Well Adam, I think what could be done, I mean this is a kind of aggressive geoengineering approach is um one could make volatile catalysts that go up in the atmosphere and with UV light oxidize the the methane to CO2 and then we fix the CO2 on earth. Yeah, potentially. I was or or even maybe rather than catalyst something like generating extra ozone but like up in the stratosphere where it wouldn't be because it's actually not good for people that to have it down in the you know the the layers of the atmosphere what we're breathing, but but basically more radical creation up in the upper atmosphere.

You have your active catalyst component embedded in other functionality that is helping to concentrate methane. The problem is methane in particular is difficult to get to bind strongly to anything. But um people have shown things like that can help for CO2 where you have functional groups nearby that bring CO2 in and then drop it off at the catalyst. Um that might be a way that you could take some of these catalysts that don't work well with low partial pressures of methane and increase the local concentration of methane enough that they'll actually hit it and do catalysis.

With methane, I can't envision specifically an electronic interaction between an active site and methane that would essentially bind methane or give me that sort of a sharp affinity and shape of iso shape of the isotherm. So maybe it's easier with CO2 because it's been done and I we've seen it in the literature, but that's that's what at least I think limits me in my mind and I don't know if others have ideas as to how you could create the strong affinity between I mean we all recognize that it's an apolar molecule relative to CO2, but is there what would what is a creative way to create a let's say strong chemical bond between um a site on a surface and and methane.",

Um that's a lot of complex architecture to put together. Um but I don't know uh you know, that's one thought. I guess you're totally right. Otherwise, what intermolecular forces does methane like to do nothing really. It it's crappy at Vander walls interactions, it's crappy at any kind of dispersion interactions, but at least it does like to to form this perfect little pocket of oxygens and hydrogens and sit in there nicely.

You know things like quinuclidine radical cation can pull CH bonds off of almost anything is one there's decatungstate catalysts that can also do CH extraction from almost anything. So I've always thought about this like probably nobody would ever has taken these and tried them with methane but some of them would probably be strong enough in line with what what Leslie was saying about chlorine radical.

So trying to if I can articulate it uh in in in terms of what I understood taking this hydrogen bonded network that is responsible for methane concentration within clathrates and trying to reproduce that in a let's say porous material to capture methane at low concentrations. I mean that's I just find that fascinating. Maybe there's someone that is more computationally oriented that could see if this is actually possible but I found I found that idea or thought quite quite interesting actually.

        "transcript": "Um, so you know, one of the pervasive themes that we had through our discussion was in terms of mechanisms of electrochemical CO2 reduction, do we even need to know the mechanism? And and this discussion was came out of um how the chemical process industry has developed prior to this with a lot of Edison type experiments where they build things and maybe do a kind of um high throughput or some kind of screening at a relevant industrial scale to find operational conditions or not. And so it's an open question of do we first need to understand mechanisms at an atomic lab scale. Um, and then if those do translate, um, we need to make that translation clear because both computationally and experimentally, um looking at mechanisms are typically done on well defined surfaces or well defined systems with, you know, probably not a lot of flow or or or um mass transport, but if we look at what this technology would potentially need to be at a high TRL, um probably the conditions would be very, very different and the mechanisms would probably change. And this has implications for both the materials, so materials durability, um and selectivity requirements changing as a function of operation conditions, um degradation modes will probably be different, you know, flooding happens at at larger scales and salt formations which may not need to be dealt with at the lab scale. So, um, it's the kind of the two prong question of do we need to wait or even to say do we even have the time to wait and look at this from the atomic scale up and take every step there, or can we learn from some of the previous chemical process industry to see um we need kind of the large scale testing and assessment there to feed the relevant conditions into the the fundamental science. So we recognize the need for both the applied and fundamental work, but I think one of the key messages is that we need that feedback loop to be much quicker and more direct and lean on what's been done with with other even electrochemical technologies. Um, you know, looking at what kind of characterization, I think we all agree and with the other group as well that operando and in situ characterization is absolutely necessary. Um, you know, doing ex situ work and looking at sites afterwards, there may be reconstruction um or or changes that are not due to the catalysis. So, um getting good time spatial energetic resolution on various operando techniques is necessary. Um, we briefly did talk about CO2 reduction uh and saying that you know, copper is a great material but it can't do it all uh or it can't do it all very good. So, um either looking into ways to alloy copper with other materials to steer selectivity or put it in a different local environment um uh with ionomers or electrolytes that could change its selectivity beyond the intrinsic proper properties of copper. Um, and then a lot of discussion with with uh process systems integration life cycle assessment is if we want to site an electrochemical CO2 reduction reactor in a chemical uh process or industry, um, we may need to take use of waste heat from other processes that can help tune certain things. Um, I think the advantage of electrochemistry is flexibility, uh whereas thermochemistry you kind of want to keep it at a steady state. So, um that that's I think the major points uh that came from our room.",

And uh the the thing is that we also need to to probably do experiments in the lab scale in a in a in a in a system that is actually relevant to to any scale up or industrialization. So as part of the first year of the, we have developed a gas tight rotating cylinder electrode cell where we put the model uh copper poly copper electrode and we rotate it at different uh rates. And as you rotate it, even though you have the same potential, you actually start to see dramatic changes in in selectivity. We already uh also we have the preprint in in our website. So what we see is that actually mass transport control selectivity and the the the problem is a little bit more complex. So you actually have a lot of uh CO that is the main reaction intermediate that dissolves and hangs around near the surface of the electrode long enough. So at the near the surface of the electrode it actually behaves as a sort of CSTR a continuous stirred tank reactor and then uh what happens is that we get a lot of high uh conversion of CO and uh theory is trying to do a lot of mechanistic understanding of of those systems actually on under high uh conversion of CO and uh typically you don't study kinetics under under those conditions, right?

Uh so long story short, I think the challenge was to get uh an electrochemical cell that allows you to control mass transport and at the same time allows you to do product quantification and detection.

I'd like I'm very grateful for David's support and for our facilitators Chris and Ellen as well as our excellent participants. So there were several aspects that came up uh over the course of our discussion uh particularly in the context of the need for DAC. Um so one of the nice things about direct air capture is that it can be deployed independently of point source emissions and as we continue as we continue to use fossil fuels, there is going to be an increased need for DAC particularly from sectors that are challenging to decarbonize such as transportation. We're going to need DAC to clean up emissions from uh such sectors. Uh one of the interesting things that came up over the course of our discussion was the fact that there is considerable geographical variability in resources and how that might actually impact the deployment of CO2 capture and DAC technologies. So for example, if you're in regions of the world where uh moisture contents are different or in certain locations where the compositions of air are even different, separation technologies will need to be tailored for such regions. Uh this is a challenge but it's also an opportunity because it locks it it helps us unlock many fresh ideas and innovations in the context of DAC. Uh and perhaps you can take some of that understanding and translate that for CO2 capture as well from diverse set of um emissions. So with that said, our team uh sees the challenge of variability of compositions as something that can actually unlock more innovation. So we think it's actually a positive in the context of um innovating in this space. We also think that understanding durability, economic costs and incentive structures are crucial under real world operating conditions. And this actually goes back to the point that uh Carlos had made about uh the need for molecular scale science as well as the process scale engineering to come together to inform economic costs and incentive structure incentive structures. So they so really there is a need for cross scale thinking in this particular line of work. Uh this line this approach may be unconventional for some of the other research areas but in this area it is crucially needed. Uh another important consideration uh which is unique to DAC is that we need to consider the end fate of CO2 and that would really dictate where we would actually put or implement DAC. Is the CO2 going to be stored underground? Is it going to be coupled to utilization? Is it going to be coupled to mineralization? In which case the kind of DAC technology that would get deployed might need to get customized. And also this part of the question of uh CO2 conversion to products and our team took the view that CO2 conversion to products is insufficient from the perspective of climate. We wrapped up our discussion from a rather big picture perspective of where DAC and CO2 capture are headed.",

        "transcript": "Yeah, so I'm Katie Knowles, I'll be sort of reporting out what we did based on the sort of detailed notes that Ellen took uh during our discussion. And so um so we're talking about uh materials for separation and storage and uh we talked a lot about the challenges for materials discovery and development. And I think some of these um are continuing on some themes that were discussed in other groups. So gaps between computational predictions and experiments, the fact that like if um if a computational study identifies a new material that might be um advantageous for uh separation or storage application, it takes time to actually synthesize that material or it might not be possible to synthesize that material. So um taking uh feasibility into account when doing these um these uh sort of computational uh predictions. Um we also I uh identified the the need for training sets for machine learning approaches. So um uh sufficient characterization data under the dynamic operating conditions that a lot of these um sorbents uh work under um is needed uh for for this. Um we also talked about some of the challenges with scale up. So so lab scale experiments synthesis versus application scale. Um so things that you consider to be in operando on the lab scale might not truly represent your application scale um conditions. I think this was touched on in some other groups. Um so degradation processes and reversibility or cyclability issues for the um the sorbents that you know, absorb and then we want to release the CO2 at like the storage or conversion um area. A lot of these sorbents function at non-equilibrium conditions, so might eventually break down. Um some of these degradation products might be sort of the active materials in the storage or catalysis that you're doing. Um and then I think this point kind of goes back into the modeling where we need to understand what the uncertainties are in the model uh uh predictions in order to um you know, apply them in a useful way. Also interfaces are key in these uh sort of material applications but hard to understand. So interfaces is where most of the action happens, but it's it's all these complex processes occur. The interfacial structure is dynamic and different than bulk structure and therefore hard to characterize. Um we also talked about some underexplored sort of physical phenomena related to um CO2 separation and storage. Um and this uh sort of the area of sorbents, we talked about light or using light or electrochemistry or humidity swings to trigger desorption might be sort of new um axes to think about um in this context. Um for storage, we talked about CO2 mineralization and some physical phenomena that needed to kind of understand or accelerate that process um or better understandings of precipitation and dissolution dissolution phenomena both sort of solid liquid. So at the solid liquid um interface when you're um sort of forming these sort of solid minerals and at the liquid gas interface when you're actually dissolving CO2 into your liquid um sorbent. We also talked about um some interesting ideas about mining, coupling mineralization with mining of valuable elements. And then finally we talked about some design criteria to keep in mind when when thinking about these things. So thermal conductivity, especially if um you know, the heats of adsorption and desorption are playing a role in the sorbents, electrical conductivity for the electrochemical materials, transparency if we're talking about using uh light as a trigger. Um materials that can accommodate self-healing or assisted healing processes. Um and then just taking a lot of knowledge from the catalysis community um that they've developed about um adsorption and desorption and sort of balancing the energetics of those two processes and to inform the design of materials for um I think thinking about sorbents again in this case. So I think that sums up a lot of what we talked about.",

Um I go by Leslie, which is my middle name and I'm assistant professor at UC Riverside and I'm thankful for the conversations that we had um with our participants and the facilitator, Jordi and George. Um so we talked about methane capture and valorization and one of the initial um starts of the conversation was what are the potential emitters or emissions. Um and so we're thinking agricultural sites, um fossil fuels of course is a major emitter. Um but then also we have methane in the atmosphere. And so is it really conducive to uh try to capture um if we're going for negative emissions methane out of the atmosphere and you know, how would that work? Will we work from point sources or do we work from dilute sources. And um it seems like we had agreement that maybe point sources would be the best option. However, um even if we try to um develop some sort of technology that can take methane from these point sources, they're actually pretty dilute in terms of they have a lot of variability. Um where you can have a few PPMs of methane to hundreds of PPM um for example at agricultural sources. And then there's other mediations um for removing methane, um uh for example from cows and and that's changing their diets and and um other technological innovations like having them wear a mask or something. Um but if we talk about uh developing technological solutions that we can eventually implement here with the um people that are within this group, um we talked about a lot of different things and I say that you can probably divide it into three. So it's leaving the chemistry of methane alone, the molecule which is naturally nonpolar and then doing something with that, maybe changing the pressure or temperature to try to store it.",
