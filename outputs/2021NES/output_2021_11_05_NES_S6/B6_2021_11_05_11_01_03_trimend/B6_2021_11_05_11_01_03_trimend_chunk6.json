But things like that or electro electrical field electrochemistry to actually drive this processes at low temperature. So that actually is a reactive absorption that that can beat nature. Just just some thought put in there so no yeah I don't intend to interrupt the discussion. So.",

They they try to get complete combustion as much they can because they because it's how they generate electricity. The issue is the combustion can never be well practically sometimes it's not as complete as people might thought about. That's why there's still residual methane out of that and that's why the photo energy of it still want to have a FOA on that. The residual methane out of that is in the range of about 0.01% which is about 100 ppm to 0.1% about 1000 ppm and that's the level the at least that's what I learned from that FOA.",

But if you you know I don't know if they've gotten into like two-stage combustion but I mean if you had point source capture and you you know you condense off water and you absorb a lot of the CO2 then in in the stream that's left you could put that through something like a catalytic converter and and burn off what what remains. I don't know how much of that's been thought about in the industry already but that that seems like the way to do it over trying to get trying to go from 99.99 to 99.9999 in in one step.",

Chemists are trying to replicate the methane monooxygenase chemistry with with no avail like even our group tries to do that and it's not really going anywhere.

You know things like quinuclidine radical cation can pull CH bonds off of almost anything is one there's decatungstate catalysts that can also do CH extraction from almost anything. So I've always thought about this like probably nobody would ever has taken these and tried them with methane but some of them would probably be strong enough in line with what what Leslie was saying about chlorine radical.
