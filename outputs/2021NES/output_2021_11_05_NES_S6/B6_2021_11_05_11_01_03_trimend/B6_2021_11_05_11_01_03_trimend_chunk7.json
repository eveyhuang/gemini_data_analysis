But at one one bar, um it can be done at ambient pressure um and and the ambient temperature. Um but I think at least in our case, um the issue out of that is we're using sulfuric acid as a solvent and it's not a very forgiving solvent to be honest. Um and that's a big challenge and when we we also get funded by BSF on this project because they care about methane too. Um and and the separation cost is a big issue at least at a room temperature um out of um sulfuric acid.",

So let me just so I started from, you know, us talking about emitters. Um so we talked about landfills, um agricultural sites, coal mines, and then I've also heard melting of ice caps. Um we thought um agriculture is a major emitter. Um but what is best in collection? Is it uh from dilute sources or can we collect it um um at the point source? And then um uh then uh we talked about methane concentration by the cows can be very due to diet and how they are raised, um can vary from PPM levels to hundreds of PPMs. If we move more to the catalysis side and trying to solve it, um the ideas that I have is um oxidation of methane to CO2. Um one idea was possibly integrate this in air capture. Um it's not controversial, but it could move um this forward. Um maybe storing the methane into clathrates um to capture the water, but what were the challenges there that it has to be at least 20 bar and was there any other challenges that I missed there?",
