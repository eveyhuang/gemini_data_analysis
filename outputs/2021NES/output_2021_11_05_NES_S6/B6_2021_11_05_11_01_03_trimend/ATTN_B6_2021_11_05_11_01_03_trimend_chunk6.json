So for the methane, you could essentially thinking about high driving force either by light or temperature is difficult because you need to move large volume of air through the furnace. But things like that or electro electrical field, electrochemistry to actually drive these processes at low temperature. So that actually is a reactive absorption that that can beat nature.",

So why not just oxidize methane completely into CO2 and and use our traditional ways of CO2 capture there.",

Um the the the the the issue is the the combustion can never be well practically sometimes it's not as complete as people might thought about.
