Don't let the 50 years of people trying and failing deter you from it. The lithium, the first lithium batteries from 1971 or 73 and you know it's just now that lithium batteries are really making you know compelling inroads, right? 50 years later. Think about those scientific challenges and you know go for those. Any anything that along those lines that you would want to emphasize in this line. Not to deter you from the oxidation part, just in addition, okay? In the last three minutes that we have.",

In terms of promising it it's also it also tends to be very challenging to replicate. I think the primary and secondary coordination environment of enzymes. So so that tends to be very hard to do synthetically. So yeah, I think I think it's an interesting scientific problem and I think uh yeah, there's a lot to be gained there but uh yeah, it depends on how you define promising I guess. The the ideal that was put out that I really sort of that peaked my interest was what Philip was mentioning. So trying to if I can articulate it uh in in in terms of what I understood taking this hydrogen bonded network that is responsible for methane concentration within clathrates and trying to reproduce that in a let's say porous material to capture methane at low concentrations. I mean that's I just find that fascinating. Maybe there's someone that is more computationally oriented that could see if this is actually possible but I found I found that idea or thought quite quite interesting actually. The microbes I threw it out there but I I also know that it's very challenging.",

But on on on the topic of that is are there any issues with with selectivity to the methane as opposed to like CO2 sorption? I mean I'm because I I would imagine a lot of those materials also absorb CO2 and then pulling pulling the methane out of a mixed stream could be more challenging than you know just like capturing methane from methane and nitrogen or whatever we might do the experiments with.",

I think they're different in structure but they can form them too. So that is something that would be a tricky thing. The I guess the the dumb answer I would say to that is we know how to we have crappy technologies for removing CO2 from air if we need to. And you know so you could always think about scrubbing CO2 out first and then methane out because the methane will just go through anything that's CO2 selective but you're right that finding ones that have methane over source CO2 or nitrogen or O2 could be a problem. There are all kind of similar in size, yeah.",

So dipole uh or um um the these interactions just put a a little electric field on it and just use the same concept as mass spec, right? Methane will not nothing happen to it, but CO2 will just bend, right? So you will separate it like with an electric field and if that's a problem, otherwise, you know, that maybe you want them together to to to to do something rather than become one into the other.",

And uh and we also consider carbon. Okay, CO2 uh convert CO2 to carbon which is certainly crazy. We discussed about that.
