            "transcript": "Okay. All right, so I have this is just the Okay. So sorbents, I think that's where we started the conversation. We talked about can we you know can we design sorbents that can switch between carbon capture and storage and DAC. Sorbent properties we discussed will we got on a tangent where we were talking about um that sorbents might can we just design a sorbent that works for both capture and storage but also um that that we one might one sorbent might not fit all the criteria because they're geographically specific or obviously the environment's going to play a role in what sorbent is a good sorbent. Um we said that sorbents operate we can we design sorbents that operate over a wide concentration, um so you can use them for DAC and natural gas. Then under again I I've just recently moved these all together trying to lump these together. Um DAC, are there DAC treatment trains that don't do not involve point of source? A lot of DAC you have a wet stream and potentially can be used directly with greenhouse and agriculture. Um but we were discussing basically like that there this is just opportunities of of different DAC systems. Okay, let's see. Um down here I've kind of put these as underneath DAC. Point of source versus direct air capture or combined. If you're building an infrastructure for point of source capture, um there's a a capital benefit for coupling. Um development and optimization of treatment trains may be a pathway to get to net negative over the life of the plant. Um and then there was a lot of discussion on soils which I some of that I did not I missed, but pre-concentrating CO2 in soils and buildings and leveraging HVAC systems. I think this is essentially having the discussion of um how we can combine existing infrastructure for DAC. Um and then the last kind of area was capture integrated with transportation. Okay, this is this is kind of goes along with this one. Um integrating capture with transportation. This is when people were talking about airplanes, submarines, spacecraft, um given the fuel consumption, especially in transportation, that's the motivation. Um combining capture with low carbon energy sources. Um we talked about the capital cost for right now direct air capture is around 300 to 500 dollars per ton, um where at point of source it's you know 100. Um and getting to 100 dollars per ton we discussed pragmatic engineering approaches um where repurposing infrastructure may get us there faster. Um we discussed briefly policy and its role and there was again an example of soil health where you can motivate farmers essentially um to use best practices because you know there might be a benefit to soil essentially a duality of benefits um beyond capture but also soil health. Um and yeah, the concrete if we can add some more this is when I was playing around with the organization if there's anything about the concrete that um you guys felt was salient that I missed, let me know.",

But it does have a very high ceiling for efficiency. And for conversion, Roger you probably know more about it than I do, but we also started getting into capture and conversion. Actually, I was on a lab piece proposal with Chris Hahn at Livermore on this topic and you know from I've always done CO2 conversion and we you know we feed it a 100% pure gas tank into our system. But if you when I started working on capture, I was like, you know, it's the release that's the energetically intensive part. So capture is really passive, relatively passive. So if we can just do direct conversion of that, then it would be much much more efficient. But then it's like a whole new substrate. You know, 30 years of chemists working on CO2 as a substrate, now we have to think about carbamates or alkoxides or sorry carbonates as substrates. It's a little bit of a different beast. I think there's a lot of fundamental science there. I think it's I mean, I love this meeting because there's tons of engineers, but I feel like I always think very differently where I'm like, what are the science questions? And they're like, it's a different, you know, I think there's a lot of fundamental science that needs to be done in terms of the chemistry of capture agents, activation, potentials, you know, stability under reductive conditions, things like that, that that need to be done, solubility, before we can really push forward on combined capture and conversion.",

Um based on our experience, it's not necessary like what I mentioned earlier, it's not necessary to get 100% pure of CO2 and and also it's not necessary to be the gas phase CO2. For example, if you have the sorbents in there, if we can directly electrochemically convert the CO2 sorbent you know complex directly to the fuels and chemicals, that that can eliminate away the desorption process which is the most energy consumption part that I mentioned. And also but that comes to another important point that I I noticed is depending on different type of point sources, depending on the compositions in these low CO2 streams, and also depending on the downstream CO2 conversion process, it might not be a universal rule, uh guideline to solve this problem. It's because for example, when you do the electrochemistry um to let's say reduce CO2 to to CO or formic acid, as long as there is oxygen in your stream, you will kill all the efficiency. So it really depends but for for different applications, oxygen won't make any impact. So it really depends on very specific downstream applications and your upstream compositions. So that needs to be more carefully uh investigated.",
