Uh I do like the the general concept though of you know, carbon capture coupled with DAC. I think there's a lot of interesting work there. Um one that might fit well for this dialogue is, you know, can we design sorbents, solvents, membranes, whatever, um that can kind of switch between the two modes of traditional carbon capture and DAC. Um I could see some scenarios where that would be useful. So that's one area of potential research.",

Energy consumption might be several factors difference, right? The several folders of difference. Um I would say if I don't know if people have really thought about that if there is a area uh that we don't need to capture CO2 in its very high purity but in some range that is coupling with the downstream utilization. So we balance the energy consumption. Of course, if you encourage 100% pure to the downstream utilization, of course your utilization efficiency will be much higher uh but low low concentration streams might uh you need to pay some energies uh penalties, but uh if people have thought about the energy balance, let's say uh we we capture only 20% of uh concentration we capture up to 20% of the CO2, but then you do the downstream uh conversions will still uh sacrifice a little bit of energy but uh can still get the maximum um um energy efficiency for the whole process.",

Um and relatedly uh you know, we've been thinking about and I think Katherine's been thinking about um coupling you know, you can instead of going from 400 ppm to one bar, you can concentrate CO2 from air and feed that into a point source capture uh system. Um and that you know, going from 400 ppm to say 10% or um something like that is can be a lot more efficient and cheaper. Sorry. I I don't I don't mean to put words in Katherine's mouth.",

Uh and we've studied um I guess both uh when CO2 is bound to amine in the chemisorb state, we've looked both at processes um oxidatively to release the CO2 uh which is I think very well known to the community, but also to further reduce the CO2 and cycle it to either solid phases or um uh products like carbon monoxide for example. And so we uh we have done more work I would say uh looking in the non-aqueous space um flavors of those reactions and uh to try to understand some of the scientific underpinnings of those types of reactions. Uh and I will say they're very complicated um and we've spent a lot of time looking at the physical chemical properties of uh what happens when you take a capture solution and also uh kind of introduce functionalities to make it an electrolyte, um the electrochemistry becomes quite interesting and some of the uh let's say classical limiting behaviors that we take for granted in in very well defined electrochemical systems can sometimes go out the window and kind of necessitate um really looking at all aspects of the kinetics, mass transport and thermodynamics all over again. So it's been a really interesting scientific playground. Uh but then the question um that everybody always wants to know is, you know, is it practical and what is the cost and all of that and I would say it's very early days.",

Uh so we can go to about uh 1 to 2% of CO2 in in in the soil and that helps the minerals weather a little bit faster. So that's something that we realize that uh people who are putting this on on beaches or deserts or somewhere else, they don't have that benefit that there's no concentration of CO2 higher within the each sand or the desert, but there is uh that in uh uh soils that have a microbial activity that's always releasing CO2 into the pores of the soil.",
