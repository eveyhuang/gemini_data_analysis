Since this technique can be useful to gain additional information about the you know catalytic process and the chemical process for CO2 reduction.",

And the challenge is if we want to track the reaction intermediate for CO2 reduction. So at the moment it's hard to do carbon K edge experiment, okay. And for further understanding, we think you know, you know computational modeling are very important next machine learning and which is popular and AI are coordinate to coordinate to at the moment. So they can provide opportunity to for automatic data process data analysis and which can help us to understand and better understand our experiment data and to train the data which can eventually help us to design better catalyst and to improve the you know operation condition and the you know chemical process, okay. And I think another thing is about we we need more start computational study to understand the CC bond formation. If you want to make C2 above products from CO2. Yeah. I think that's kind of base summary from our discussion. Maybe Mike and someone else can can chime in.",

            "transcript": "Um, so you know, one of the brief themes that we had through our discussion was in terms of mechanisms of electrochemical CO2 reduction, do we even need to know the mechanism? And and this discussion was came out of um how the chemical process industry has developed prior to this with a lot of Esonian type experiments where they build things and maybe do a kind of um high throughput or some kind of screening at a relevant industrial scale to find operational conditions or not. And so it's an open question of do we first need to understand mechanisms at an atomic lab scale. Um, and then if those do translate, um, we need to make that translation clear because both computationally and experimentally, um looking at mechanisms are typically done on well defined surfaces or well defined systems with, you know, probably not a lot of flow or or um mass transport, but if we look at what this technology would potentially need to be at a high TRL, um probably the conditions would be very, very different and the mechanisms would probably change. And this has implications for both the materials, so materials durability, um and selectivity requirements changing as a function of operation conditions, um degradation modes will probably be different, you know, flooding happens at at larger scales and salt formations which may not need to be dealt with at the lab scale. So, um it's the kind of the two prong question of do we need to wait or even to say, do we even have the time to wait and look at this from the atomic scale up and take every step there or can we learn from some of the previous chemical process industry to see um we need kind of the large scale testing and assessment there to feed the relevant conditions into the the fundamental science. So we recognize the need for both the applied and fundamental work, but I think one of the key messages is that we need that feedback loop to be much quicker and more direct and lean on what's been done with with other even electrochemical technologies. Um, you know, part of that was, you know, defining a lot of our questions here aren't even specific to CO2, they're in general for electrochemical reactions and um, you know, then figuring out if we need to translate something, what we can probe and what we need to probe. So there's a lot of um spectroscopic and spectro electrochemical techniques that give kind of an averaging or an ensemble effect over a heterogeneous surface, um and that we lose information about single sites and single atoms and how they react. And I think both of those can be useful in in determining uh what how we need to develop a large scale um electrolyzer. Another point um that was brought up you know from the work that Charles did previously with with Jcap is uh the need for some kind of benchmarking in terms of materials but also reactor. Um and that has pros and cons from from how it was used from Jcap. It was brought up that, you know, yes we can look at um, you know, comparing materials in a very well defined system, but people may use these metrics to kind of gain the system and just focus on those metrics and ignoring others. So there's there's a um there's a dual side to having that kind of um, you know, benchmarking, but I think the CO2 reduction community is so broad and disparate right now, some formalization of that I think could be helpful for for a lot of teams. Um, you know, looking at what kind of characterization, I think we all agree and with the other group as well that operando and in situ characterization is absolutely necessary. Um, you know, doing ex situ work and looking at sites afterwards, there may be reconstruction um or or changes that are not due to the catalysis. So, um getting good time spatial and energetic resolution on various operando techniques is necessary.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I I will add that the mechanistic understanding is is is is is needed. And uh the the thing is that we also need to to probably do experiments in the lab scale in a in a in a system that is actually relevant to to any scale up or industrialization. So as part of the first year of the silo, we have developed a gas tight rotating cylinder electrode cell where we put the model uh copper polycrystalline copper electrode and we rotate it at different uh rates. And as you rotate it, uh even though you have the same potential, you actually start to see dramatic changes in in selectivity. We already uh also we have the preprint in in our website. So what we see is that actually mass transport control selectivity and uh the the problem is a little bit more complex. So you actually have a lot of uh CO that is the main reaction intermediate that dissolves and hangs around near the surface of the electrode long enough so that the near the surface of the electrode actually behaves as a sort of CSTR, a continuous stirred tank reactor. And then uh what happens is that we get a lot of uh high conversion of CO. And uh theory is trying to do a lot of mechanistic understanding of of those systems actually on under high uh conversion of CO. And uh typically you don't study kinetics under under those conditions, right? Uh but now that I think we have a good uh system, right? Uh uh a reactor that you can control mass transport and and see the influence of mass transport in electrocatalysis.",
