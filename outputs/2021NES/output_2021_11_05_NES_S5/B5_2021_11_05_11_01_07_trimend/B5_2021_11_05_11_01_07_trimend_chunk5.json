I think um I think about this a lot in the context of how we educate our students too because we really need to do, you know, massive training of this current generation to really know how to think about and um hopefully want to work on this problem and there's such it's very tantalizing to run towards very sexy new ideas into technology but I think it's really important to remind our students like you can't get around, you know, of course you can't get around the basic laws of thermodynamics but you need to have deep reverence for uh sometimes workhorse things are really what's made it and in the topic of batteries I tell my students up until recently. Now we have great new vehicles that are now on the market and I can't say this anymore but I used to say, you know, look at look at what's really making a difference in your world. Look at the types of systems, you know, we need you cannot get away from basic mechanics and um sometimes uh one might even feel like incremental tweaks within an existing infrastructure will get us there faster and much more effectively. Um and so we shouldn't we shouldn't just be attracted to the kind of academically exciting concepts but also have deep reverence for the the real workhorse kind of stuff um and train our students that that's okay, right? It doesn't always have to be new flashy ideas, sometimes we just have to make them much better.",

But I think these things, yeah, really need to be figured out. Um there's some feeling that amine systems can be translated um in a relatively straightforward manner but then and there have been some demonstrations actually um in some of these some of these industries but I guess it's there in um theory, theoretically operating and you know, 10, 20 years at scale.

But that's that's my confusing part. So how we can deal with the other carbon because you are basically you are you're making the uh the concrete you are anailing the calcium carbonate to become the calcium oxide and then becomes calcium hydroxide and then make this concrete and so on but then then you will release the same amount of CO2 away.
