And so something that Europe is moving toward is that um you're not a carbon tax to manufacture batteries, right? So that we limit that negative that that negative consumption starting point. Um and so in a nutshell, um geography is going to potentially play a role in terms of what electrochemistry we use for energy storage, right? Um so I think there's a lot of paradigms with CO2 capture and conversion, the role of policy and carbon taxes um in terms of adoption of technologies. Um but yeah, uh but that kind of goes in line with the whole treatment train of the conversation that I think we were having earlier. Um how do we combine um DA DAC with point source treatment.",

Um and so something we think about a lot um from more of a thermodynamic point of view is you think about energy consumption when you combine two technologies together. Um but something that we haven't working on again in a different area of how do you pair two a renewable energy technology with another energy technology and it's how do you minimize exergy loss when coupling multiple technologies together. Um and so there's this that's a more of an energy systems perspective. Um and so I might say it's more in the engineering than the science, but I think there's a lot of research area and like we always think about first law, right? You know first law of thermodynamics, but is that necessarily um the best to optimize for.",

I think we have to it's you know, it's all about uh value proposition if the goal and and it's and that's where policy plays a huge role. What do we value you for CO2, right? You know, how do we value that, right? Um and that's that's opportunity cost, right? Um but so I mean this is something we talk about a lot in the Anlinger Center. Policy moves too slow. You know what I mean? If we were depending on policy for electrification of transportation, we would it would be 2100, right? That's when we would have electric vehicles. But science has obviously pushed that along, right? You know, policy is not the driver for electrification right now, adoption of transportation, that's not the case.",
