So so that is additional emission because um you have you need to have a truck to um redistribute the production chemical and that come back to um and that that it's a one way to think about more efficiency is uh um maybe I'm not sure exactly does it fit into resource efficiency but on just distributed production of chemicals or maybe fertilizers if you want um so mitigate those um extra resources that would have you don't need to use um through transportation.

So maybe ramping it up, right?

I mean off the beaten path not with the scientific development, but just with these industries, let's say heavy industries, how do we get them to want to abate their um emissions? I mean, I guess it would have to be policies and things that would encourage them. But if you don't have that encouragement, um I think it I I don't I can't really see a path forward for them to try to buy in. I don't know if anybody has like a comment to that, but if these industries haven't abated emissions before and now we're telling them they have to without any government policies that are backing us up.",

So these companies are thinking not just about the gaseous emissions, but they're they're also thinking a lot about some of the other emissions that are coming out of their systems. Those could also be, you know, solid emissions or we don't typically call them emission, but it is a form of emission, right? And also liquid based.",

So if you can help them creatively address that challenge, then, you know, they get excited about it. And so we've been doing a lot of work in the sector, um and particularly now in the steel sector and now in the construction material sector, helping them not just decarbonize, but also helping them defossilize, right? Because, you know, decarbonization is useful, but if you don't wean off their reliance on fossil fuels, then the problem with CO2 emissions is going to continue. So for them, the bigger challenge really is defossilization and how they can adapt to changing energy resources.",

Well, there's a few things that came to my mind when when when people talks about mining and construction. Um one thing is making cement because cement is basically carbon dioxide carbonate. So um as you can if you can find a way to make a cement out of carbonate from there, carbon dioxide from air, that would uh one way to mitigate that. Uh another things about mining. Um because I worked with microbes before, I know there's something called bio mining and the bio mining has been a uh it's in it because you need to go through the rocks and there are natural microorganisms, they can crack the rocks and extract the metals. Um it take time, but and they can secrete acid to extract metals into their body and you concentrate the biomass allows it the metals to concentrate. Um some people say they they are some discussions that we need to give those industries some uh incentives. Uh one incentive in the case of bio mining is um uh they are good at really if they are to some extent a little bit more efficient. Um if uh the grade of the mineral, the ores are lower or it's a lower concentration like gold for example or platinum, those are very trace amount of it. It's actually more economical if you go bio mining because you just wait for the rocks to get digested by the microbes before it can be extracted.",

So phyto mining is using plants to uh um basically select the metals out of uh ores. Uh so the idea would be uh you spread uh you you mine your your ore, you crush it, you spread it on land, you plant put plants there. Uh and then what uh we discussed in that meeting was about uh uh can those same minerals also sequester CO2 through enhanced weathering. So uh as the metals are coming out of them and as the calcium magnesium gets released uh is that also at the same time sequestering some some CO2. The the main challenge with the phyto mining is is is is the plants. So we we just don't have a good uh hyper accumulating plants that uh uh work for any metal, any any mineral. So uh uh there was a lot of discussion also about uh possibly genetically modifying plants uh would uh would a would a plant be better or or would a tree be better and that sort of thing.
