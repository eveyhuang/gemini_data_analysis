Um, and there were actually a lot of things that we don't historically think about. So they right now they'll give cows actually like a medication that reduces the amount of methane they make and the reason the farmers like it is because if they're not emitting the methane, it's going to cow like cow mass. Um, right? So you're trying to use these cows as like organisms to like make the most milk and gain the most weight so you can eat it. Um, I think with that too though, there's also other like dietary changes. So we feed our cows a lot of like really random stuff. Um, like weird food products, like Skittles and things. They chop it up into cow casserole because cows can't pick out something bigger than a couple inches. So, I mean cows are like giant. I don't know, I take my lab and they're like, man, cows are big to our cow barn because we have a cow barn in Wisconsin. Right? But so I think there's like a lot of things right now about, well, how do we just prevent the methane by like what we feed them or the meds we give them. And historically we're feeding them just like the cheapest junk we can find. So that's like maybe not a good technological solution, but that's like, you know, preventing it versus treating it.",

Well, there's a few things that came to my mind when when when people talks about mining and construction. Um one thing is making cement because cement is basically carbon dioxide carbonate. So um as you can if you can find a way to make a cement out of carbonate from there, carbon dioxide from air, that would uh one way to mitigate that. Uh another things about mining. Um because I worked with microbes before, I know there's something called bio mining and the bio mining has been a uh it's in it because you need to go through the rocks and there are natural microorganisms, they can crack the rocks and extract the metals. Um it take time, but and they can secrete acid to extract metals into their body and you concentrate the biomass allows it the metals to concentrate. Um some people say they they are some discussions that we need to give those industries some uh incentives. Uh one incentive in the case of bio mining is um uh they are good at really if they are to some extent a little bit more efficient. Um if uh the grade of the mineral, the ores are lower or it's a lower concentration like gold for example or platinum, those are very trace amount of it. It's actually more economical if you go bio mining because you just wait for the rocks to get digested by the microbes before it can be extracted.",

Uh and then what uh we discussed in that meeting was about uh uh can those same minerals also sequester CO2 through enhanced weathering. So uh as the metals are coming out of them and as the calcium magnesium gets released uh is that also at the same time sequestering some some CO2. The the main challenge with the phyto mining is is is is the plants. So we we just don't have a good uh hyper accumulating plants that uh uh work for any metal, any any mineral.

Um and and and the the one some people would say that there are actually some environmental benefits if you put a bioplastic into the soil because not necessarily all of them but some bioplastics because of the reason nature some organisms produce bioplastic is a energy storage mechanism for them uh in the hard times that the microbes can survive through harsh conditions. So those actually are additional carbon um reservoirs to increase the robustness of the ecosystem.

So like let's say if we were thinking about the social cost of carbon, right, which what's a dollar value per ton of carbon and its damage, then suddenly the fact that you're using this carbon would make the economics work. So I think I mean there's also a policy aspect to this where, you know, if we truly had to pay for all the carbon we're using, then these technologies actually look really good economically. I don't know that that's going to happen, but I think there's something to be said to be poised if it does happen. But then also to think about the fact that economies of scale are usually at play too, right? So it might not be economically efficient at a lab scale, but when you get to a much bigger production scale that's been optimized, suddenly these will start looking better. But then I think there's so um at our university actually we just started going we've got all these product stewardship things now about where we buy our products from. So there's a potential that it might not be the most environmentally cost effective option for buying X, but depending companies could say, you know, part of my environmental commitment is that we're buying sustainably sourced X made from carbon capture or from carbon we pulled out of the atmosphere and then suddenly like it doesn't matter if it's super cost like as long as it's not ridiculously uncost competitive, people will buy X that's the choice they're given.",

So for every hydrogen molecule that's produced, there's one CO2 molecule that gets produced. So then the question becomes if you have renewable methane, right? Can you start from renewable methane and can you end up with hydrogen while sequestering your CO2? So based on some of the earliest work that I had done, we found that the conditions at which the water gas shift reaction takes place is the condition that also favors accelerated mineralization of silicate minerals. So you can actually take silicate minerals and you can couple that mineralogy. You can't do this at ambient temperature, but the temperature at which the water gas shift reaction takes place, you can couple that reaction quite nicely. So what that does is you get a pure stream of hydrogen and you lock up your CO2 in the form of carbonate. So it serves as a reaction reactive separation mechanism.",

And you know it makes you feel good maybe similar to like a Tesla we were you know comparing a Tesla but you know it also gives you some sort of status symbol as well that you have this CO2 derived perfume.

And I I may we talked about efficiency of the energy and we talked about carbon neutral fuels. I I I think we touched on solar energy biomass clean hydrogen distributed production. There are benefits and there are challenges as well. And we talked about plastics cycling that and CO2 plastics CO2 syngas or maybe ethylene or many other things downstream. And one thing actually is about potential one approach to carbon negative hydrogen through brine and mineral based one. We talked about methane and construction and mining.
