You know, it makes me think too about um I recall that was from NSF a couple years ago where they're talking about distributed chemical manufacturing and thinking about, you know, coupling that with solar installations because I know it's well it's cause topic, but right, it gets this idea of resiliency too where right now we're seeing all these supply chain bottlenecks and issues where, you know, you can't get half of what you've ordered probably for your lab.",

You know, if you think of like a giant production facility like carbon engineering or climb works has, then yeah, you do have cyclic variations and what it's putting out. But if instead of a giant facility if you number up in terms of DAC devices, then you can play games with what's regenerating and what's sorbing at a given time and you can actually have a more continuous product stream coming out of out of a system like that. And if you're partnering with solar, the the the downside of that is of course land use, right? Because then you to number up, you need more land area.
