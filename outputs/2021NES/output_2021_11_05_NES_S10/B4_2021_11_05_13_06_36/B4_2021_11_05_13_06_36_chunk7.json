And you know and we we actually went through an economical assessment of whether this company would be successful just selling CO2 derived perfumes or CO2 derived alcohols in comparison to getting like some absolute or getting a bottle of Versace or something. And and what they thought was the best business model and this goes to your point Matt is that the best business model is actually make this some sort of luxury perfume or luxury alcohol maybe a Louis Vuitton perfume and you know it makes you feel better but the price tag is a thousand dollars for this perfume or alcohol. And you know it makes you feel good maybe similar to like a Tesla we were you know comparing a Tesla but you know it also gives you some sort of status symbol as well that you have this CO2 derived perfume. So you know that we we we talked about that in jest I don't know if it's actually an actual solution but you know I just wanted to bring that up.",

So yeah I I try to first saying that there are two major overarching goals one is we need to be aware of total environmental cost avoid transmitting emission from one to the other and when we talk about cost it's always under context of policy and pricing and it could be opportunity have new markets high value niche market but at the same time it's it could be a way to start penetrate into the market and yet but if you really want to make a big dent you still need to go through the high volume high volume applications. And I I may we talked about efficiency of the energy and we talked about carbon neutral fuels. I I I think we touched on solar energy biomass clean hydrogen distributed production. There are benefits and there are challenges as well. And we talked about plastics cycling that and CO2 plastics CO2 syngas or maybe ethylene or many other things downstream. And one thing actually is about potential one approach to carbon negative hydrogen through brine and mineral based one. We talked about methane and construction and mining.
