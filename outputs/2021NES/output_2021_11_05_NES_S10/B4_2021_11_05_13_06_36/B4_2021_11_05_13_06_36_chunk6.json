Um we talked about I we work as I work on microbes and bioplastic and a bio fertilizers. Um the benefit of that is if you're going to compete with ammonia fertilizer, it's probably going to fail because ammonia is dirt cheap. Um but the the way people try to sell it is the bio fertilizer A is more environmental friendly and also um they're the the the the components are made of microbes again, that's why I work on it. Um they have additional plant uh additional plant hormone or other metabolites that may stimulize the crop and giving better yields out of that. So so that's I just trying to using that as example to show that um it is another opportunity to think about not just replacing existing ones, but providing additional benefits to justify not just from the cost perspective.",

            "transcript": "I mean, I think this is where you really get into that idea of total environmental cost accounting where we need to think about not just the market value, but then how the cost overall. So like let's say if we were thinking about the social cost of carbon, right, which what's a dollar value per ton of carbon and its damage, then suddenly the fact that you're using this carbon would make the economics work. So I think I mean there's also a policy aspect to this where, you know, if we truly had to pay for all the carbon we're using, then these technologies actually look really good economically. I don't know that that's going to happen, but I think there's something to be said to be poised if it does happen. But then also to think about the fact that economies of scale are usually at play too, right? So it might not be economically efficient at a lab scale, but when you get to a much bigger production scale that's been optimized, suddenly these will start looking better. But then I think there's so um at our university actually we just started going we've got all these product stewardship things now about where we buy our products from. So there's a potential that it might not be the most environmentally cost effective option for buying X, but depending companies could say, you know, part of my environmental commitment is that we're buying sustainably sourced X made from carbon capture or from carbon we pulled out of the atmosphere and then suddenly like it doesn't matter if it's super cost like as long as it's not ridiculously uncost competitive, people will buy X that's the choice they're given.",

Um so what are what are some of the new potential markets that have these added benefits as you've uh all been talking about potentially and also uh since um you brought up the point of like there's some things we could think about making but maybe they're not energy efficient or we don't have good pathways to um what are the um the the research gaps that I mean if it's it's not a theoretical barrier, you know, violating some or something like that. Why are they so energy inefficient? So maybe pull pull on one of those threads?",

So so maybe somewhere where these uh brines would be the only sort of water option uh but there's a need to produce the hydrogen. Uh we're still uh sort of in preliminary phase just looking at the compositions of brines, uh geochemical modeling of it.

So for every hydrogen molecule that's produced, there's one CO2 molecule that gets produced. So then the question becomes if you have renewable methane, right? Can you start from renewable methane and can you end up with hydrogen while sequestering your CO2? So based on some of the earliest work that I had done, we found that the conditions at which the water gas shift reaction takes place is the condition that also favors accelerated mineralization of silicate minerals. So you can actually take silicate minerals and you can couple that mineralogy. You can't do this at ambient temperature, but the temperature at which the water gas shift reaction takes place, you can couple that reaction quite nicely. So what that does is you get a pure stream of hydrogen and you lock up your CO2 in the form of carbonate. So it serves as a reaction reactive separation mechanism.",
