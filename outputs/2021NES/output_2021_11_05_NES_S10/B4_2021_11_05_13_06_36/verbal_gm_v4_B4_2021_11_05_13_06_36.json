Um, right? So you're trying to use these cows as like organisms to like make the most milk and gain the most weight so you can eat it. Um, I think with that too though, there's also other like dietary changes. So we feed our cows a lot of like really random stuff. Um, like weird food products, like Skittles and things. They chop it up into cow casserole because cows can't pick out something bigger than a couple inches. So, I mean cows are like giant. I don't know, I take my lab and they're like, man, cows are big to our cow barn because we have a cow barn in Wisconsin. Right? But so I think there's like a lot of things right now about, well, how do we just prevent the methane by like what we feed them or the meds we give them.

Um some people say they they are some discussions that we need to give those industries some uh incentives.

Um if uh the grade of the mineral, the ores are lower or it's a lower concentration like gold for example or platinum, those are very trace amount of it.

So I think I mean there's also a policy aspect to this where, you know, if we truly had to pay for all the carbon we're using, then these technologies actually look really good economically. I don't know that that's going to happen, but I think there's something to be said to be poised if it does happen. But then also to think about the fact that economies of scale are usually at play too, right? So it might not be economically efficient at a lab scale, but when you get to a much bigger production scale that's been optimized, suddenly these will start looking better. But then I think there's so um at our university actually we just started going we've got all these product stewardship things now about where we buy our products from. So there's a potential that it might not be the most environmentally cost effective option for buying X, but depending companies could say, you know, part of my environmental commitment is that we're buying sustainably sourced X made from carbon capture or from carbon we pulled out of the atmosphere and then suddenly like it doesn't matter if it's super cost like as long as it's not ridiculously uncost competitive, people will buy X that's the choice they're given.

So 85% of the hydrogen that we that we produce comes from steam methane reforming. So for every hydrogen molecule that's produced, there's one CO2 molecule that gets produced. So then the question becomes if you have renewable methane, right? Can you start from renewable methane and can you end up with hydrogen while sequestering your CO2? So based on some of the earliest work that I had done, we found that the conditions at which the water gas shift reaction takes place is the condition that also favors accelerated mineralization of silicate minerals. So you can actually take silicate minerals and you can couple that mineralogy. You can't do this at ambient temperature, but the temperature at which the water gas shift reaction takes place, you can couple that reaction quite nicely. So what that does is you get a pure stream of hydrogen and you lock up your CO2 in the form of carbonate. So it serves as a reaction reactive separation mechanism. ",
