I wouldn't say crazy, but you know, out of the box, uh cows wearing masks or cows wearing catalytic converters or backpacks that we have heard. Um, but you know, I thought that was really interesting about what's a good step forward for trying to abate um emissions at these different point sources. Um, and you know, there's creative ideas, but I don't know what would be a more viable route to go. So.",

So so that's something that they're trying to look into and is to uh claim carbon credits for uh preserving soil health, uh accumulating organic carbon in the soil. Uh so it's it's always important with any sort of problem to see that can you can you solve the problem or can you sort of combine it with some other solution uh and that's sort of what they they're going for is to to say that uh yes we we continue to emit but our soils will capture CO2.",

Um, and there were actually a lot of things that we don't historically think about. So they right now they'll give cows actually like a medication that reduces the amount of methane they make and the reason the farmers like it is because if they're not emitting the methane, it's going to cow like cow mass. Um, right? So you're trying to use these cows as like organisms to like make the most milk and gain the most weight so you can eat it. Um, I think with that too though, there's also other like dietary changes. So we feed our cows a lot of like really random stuff. Um, like weird food products, like Skittles and things. They chop it up into cow casserole because cows can't pick out something bigger than a couple inches. So, I mean cows are like giant. I don't know, I take my lab and they're like, man, cows are big to our cow barn because we have a cow barn in Wisconsin. Right? But so I think there's like a lot of things right now about, well, how do we just prevent the methane by like what we feed them or the meds we give them. And historically we're feeding them just like the cheapest junk we can find. So that's like maybe not a good technological solution, but that's like, you know, preventing it versus treating it.",
