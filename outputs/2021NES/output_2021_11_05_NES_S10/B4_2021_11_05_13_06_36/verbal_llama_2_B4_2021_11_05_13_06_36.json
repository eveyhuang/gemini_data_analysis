Um because I worked with microbes before, I know there's something called bio mining and the bio mining has been a uh it's in it because you need to go through the rocks and there are natural microorganisms, they can crack the rocks and extract the metals. Um it take time, but and they can secrete acid to extract metals into their body and you concentrate the biomass allows it the metals to concentrate. Um some people say they they are some discussions that we need to give those industries some uh incentives. Uh one incentive in the case of bio mining is um uh they are good at really if they are to some extent a little bit more efficient. Um if uh the grade of the mineral, the ores are lower or it's a lower concentration like gold for example or platinum, those are very trace amount of it.

So like let's say if we were thinking about the social cost of carbon, right, which what's a dollar value per ton of carbon and its damage, then suddenly the fact that you're using this carbon would make the economics work. So I think I mean there's also a policy aspect to this where, you know, if we truly had to pay for all the carbon we're using, then these technologies actually look really good economically. I don't know that that's going to happen, but I think there's something to be said to be poised if it does happen. But then also to think about the fact that economies of scale are usually at play too, right? So it might not be economically efficient at a lab scale, but when you get to a much bigger production scale that's been optimized, suddenly these will start looking better. But then I think there's so um at our university actually we just started going we've got all these product stewardship things now about where we buy our products from. So there's a potential that it might not be the most environmentally cost effective option for buying X, but depending companies could say, you know, part of my environmental commitment is that we're buying sustainably sourced X made from carbon capture or from carbon we pulled out of the atmosphere and then suddenly like it doesn't matter if it's super cost like as long as it's not ridiculously uncost competitive, people will buy X that's the choice they're given.

So then the question becomes if you have renewable methane, right? Can you start from renewable methane and can you end up with hydrogen while sequestering your CO2? So based on some of the earliest work that I had done, we found that the conditions at which the water gas shift reaction takes place is the condition that also favors accelerated mineralization of silicate minerals. So you can actually take silicate minerals and you can couple that mineralogy. You can't do this at ambient temperature, but the temperature at which the water gas shift reaction takes place, you can couple that reaction quite nicely. So what that does is you get a pure stream of hydrogen and you lock up your CO2 in the form of carbonate. So it serves as a reaction reactive separation mechanism. ",

And I I may we talked about efficiency of the energy and we talked about carbon neutral fuels. I I I think we touched on solar energy biomass clean hydrogen distributed production. There are benefits and there are challenges as well. And we talked about plastics cycling that and CO2 plastics CO2 syngas or maybe ethylene or many other things downstream.
