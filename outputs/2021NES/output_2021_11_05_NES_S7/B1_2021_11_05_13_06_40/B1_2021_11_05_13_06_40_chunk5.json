I think there are some I've seen some techno-economic analyses that have tried to tackle that question like how do things like capacity fit into the scheme and how as a rough rule of thumb often times we solve the problem something like a minimal program to a different place or maybe less I apologize I don't remember exactly who said it um move the problem elsewhere is there um ways we can become more because there's not enough capacity do better on uh getting ahead of that curve it's a complicated question and not just discovering the problems after we...",

And you know another way of thinking... and if you have a low capacity you're every time you're heating up and pulling vacuum you're spending energy and that costs a lot.

I have some experience on that because part of my postdoc research was reducing carbon dioxide and make bioplastic and the bioplastic are designed to be degradable because microbes can take that as an energy source. Um and I think it's a neutral process neutral technology for sure. Um and some people would say that there are actually some environmental benefits if you put a bioplastic into the soil because not necessarily all but some bioplastics because the reason nature some organisms produce bioplastic is an energy storage mechanism for them in a hard time that the microbes can survive through harsh conditions. So there are actually additional carbon source for the soil to increase the robustness of the ecosystem. Um and that's sometimes so even though eventually if coming to the carbon cycle carbon dioxide get emitted into the atmosphere but there are actually some ecological arguments saying that you are benefiting the soil by providing some additional food for the microbes.",

So that's one way of thinking about CO2 as a greenhouse gas. There are hypotheses that I can test in terms of methane.

A lot of catalysts that are very very highly active for hydrogen atom transfer and my guess is none of them have been evaluated for their ability to react with methane. The challenge there is that it's just not the target of interest. So things like hydrazines, quiniclidines, and some other kinds of catalysts to hit weak CH bonds. I guess some of them in the right environment would probably be able to react with methane. It's an interesting area that I don't know a ton about but it's all about the thermodynamics down to the point where the cost and also where the energy is from. Not just capture but react, extract hydrogen from methane. Some of them are probably able to do that. Some of them have very very high driving forces and would probably be able to hit methane if you can get it concentrated enough that's probably the limiting factor.",
