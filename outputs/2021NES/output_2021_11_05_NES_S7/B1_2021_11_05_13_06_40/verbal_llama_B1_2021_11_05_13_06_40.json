The challenge there is that it's just not the target of interest. So things like hydrazines, quiniclidines, and some other kinds of catalysts to hit weak CH bonds. I guess some of them in the right environment would probably be able to react with methane. It's an interesting area that I don't know a ton about but it's all about the thermodynamics down to the point where the cost and also where the energy is from. Not just capture but react, extract hydrogen from methane. Some of them are probably able to do that.
