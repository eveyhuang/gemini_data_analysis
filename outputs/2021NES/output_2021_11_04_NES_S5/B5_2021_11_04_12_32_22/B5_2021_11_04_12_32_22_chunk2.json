So uh think about that scale. Uh a lot of people propose for example how what once we capture that CO2 how we are going to deal with them right? That that is also related with the concentration you want to concentrate from the air. Um you want to go 100%",

            "transcript": "purity or 90% or 70%. So the high purity will get correct me from wrong it will probably exponentially increase the cost and so on. So so that's one um a typical thing that we could could think about is because the downstream utilization for CO2 is not necessary to be high purity. So I'm not sure if in the direct air capture field people already think about that. So let's say we concentrate the CO2 to 10 10% or 20% it could already being utilized for example in electrochemistry we can we can use low strain concentrated CO2 to do the to do the conversion with only small sacrificial of the energy consumptions. Uh so this needs to be you know balanced if you want to concentrate more in the in the capture step and then you sacrifice less amount of energy in the conversion and to calculate the the energy difference so uh probably can optimize the um the both process.",

            "transcript": "I like that point and maybe kind of building on it and what I what I noticed during introductions was that uh it seemed like a lot of us work on uh conversion or separation type processes. So specifically if you're thinking about not just capture but a combined capture conversion process, I think uh your point about what is that downstream use and how pure does it need to be, can you balance then, right? Energy and cost needs for that capture process versus how selective can we make maybe a catalytic conversion process to then either just some condensed form if we're making um chunks of coal and we're going to bury it again or if we're going to make some fuels or chemicals that we're going to use and and sequester some other way.",

            "transcript": "And one thing I would add or weigh on is for the slide it said like thinking about the energy metrics. I would argue you actually shouldn't think about the energy metric. You should think about the carbon metrics. Right? Because how much energy you use the carbon will be different you know whether it's from coal or solar or whatever. But also thinking about the carbon intensity of like your catalyst which you need to think about for the whole life cycle as well. Right? So if it's a super carbon intensive catalyst to make we have to get a lot of carbon out of the air for that to make sense. If it's a less carbon intensive catalyst to make then we don't. So I'd actually say the slide's wrong and we shouldn't think about energy metrics. It should be about carbon metrics. There. That's my so let's be provocative. That's what I got.",

So, um direct air capture needs essentially in most implementations unless they are electrochemical, it needs heat and it needs air. And uh there should be a lot of opportunities to kind of integrate direct air capture with already existing processes and sites where waste heat is available. And I think what would be really helpful would be to kind of like um look a little bit at possibilities of integrating um direct air capture with with with with pre-existing processes, seeing what the possible benefits are of doing so. Um and and maybe doing an a survey and an assessment um of these possibilities. I hope I'm I'm expressing myself clearly.",

            "transcript": "Maybe I can add a little bit. So Marcel, it's a good point and I think that compared to point source capture, direct air capture opens up different types of energy as well, right? Because you're not location specific. You can be, you can co-locate with another industrial sources. So all of you are pointing to conversion part, right? If you're doing it at power plant, you have plenty of waste heat so then maybe you will use heat to regenerate your solvent. But what if you have renewable energy? It may not be heat. It could be electro, it could be something else. Is there a non-thermal way of regenerating these materials at the same time with the capture? Some thoughts.",

I think that just to look a very quick update because I was in a similar breakout room and I think Chris was here. There was a lot of discussion on that humidity swing absorption back then. Um and something that um we've been working on it was my first time doing DAC is uh seeing if we can electrify the humidity swing. Uh something that was very interesting is uh once that CO2 is captured that's an electrochemical process. It's being captured for our side on their oxidation. It would be interesting to see uh and this is something that we haven't done it's not part of I don't know if anybody has done it but once it's captured there is there any change in its energy level that then it can be easier for people that do electrocatalysis to directly do that electrocatalysis on the surface of the electrode. Um we thought that's uh you know is there a difference in energy level that might make it uh easier for people to do conversion once it's captured on the surface.",

And I wonder uh and I uh I'm not directly involved in the field but we're looking at developing mathematical models for materials of this sort. So I just wonder uh what the team's perspective is on for example the lifespan of these materials, do these materials develop fatigue with repeated usage. Uh to some of these other combinations are they stable uh thermally stable and someone mentioned about heat and aspects of that. Uh I just wonder if there are certain lot of open questions on that end as well.",

Right? So I'm I'm a molecular chemist so I always think about this question from from the molecular levels. So and what I've been thinking about doing I mean we haven't really started is uh is is to design a molecule that is bifunctional. You know there are there are two sides on this molecule. One side is response is responsible for carbon capture and the other side which is in close proximity can be easily derivatized to either attach some catalyst or some other functional groups that can facilitate carbon dioxide conversion. So I don't really want to narrow down the the the the the the the pathways available but from the molecular the molecular uh perspective the advantage of doing this is each side like the carbon capture and the carbon conversion can be individually tuned while the distance between these two can also be fine tuned.",
