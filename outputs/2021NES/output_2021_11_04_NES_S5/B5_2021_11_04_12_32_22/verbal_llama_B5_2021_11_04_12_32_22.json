So I don't really want to narrow down the the the the the the the pathways available but from the molecular the molecular uh perspective the advantage of doing this is each side like the carbon capture and the carbon conversion can be individually tuned while the distance between these two can also be fine tuned.

I started with photo electrochemical CO2 reduction and after about two years I was like I'm not integrating everything on one thing and I took it apart. Maybe you know the literature. Um but so what I want to ask here is about this integration. Uh so I want to build on on Betar's argument because integration has pros and cons and I would really like to hear what people think. So the pros of integrating is if you integrate um capture and conversion, you can make products that potentially can be transported better, more easily. Um CO2 is a gas, ideally we could make a liquid, it would be easier to kind of gather together and and transport to a point of use. On on the other hand, um if we integrate capture and conversion, capture is not the very high intensity process. The CO2 is at 400 ppm, we need to pump immense amounts of air through the absorbers to get meaningful mole molar quantities of carbon dioxide. And then if we want to do conversion at the same site, my concern is that we will under utilize, for example, the catalytic or chemic or electro catalytic conversion system because we end up having the need of of transporting electrons through very large surface areas if we want to do the conversion directly on the absorbent, right? Which is really massive when you look at the systems built by Climeworks. And um so it it comes kind of down again to the same question like isn't it from an engineering point of view more reasonable to intensify the conversion process to essentially concentrate the CO2 up and then separately kind of do the conversion in a more intensified process than the capture. And I I would really like to hear the thoughts of people about this. ",

So to increase the the amount of size for capture, would it be possible that um a structure like a my cell or any kind of vesicle that the the peripheral positions can be used for capture and then a catalyst can sit in the center of of the my cell for the the conversion or or some some architectures like that.

So I was going down the trail of this chemical synthesis. Okay, but now we just said maybe thinking about scale chemical synthesis is not truly negative emissions based on the amount of CO2 that has to come out versus the chemicals we use. So I was trying to think, okay, maybe as a question, what should we make? Should we be making blocks of carbon coal and we're going to rebury that or are we interested in carbon composites and new building materials?

And uh the last one one of the things is the other impurities. So like uh in the point source capture there's not much oxygen, but in air we have 21% oxygen. So oxidative degradation of materials would be a lot faster and you have some rainy days, so fluctuating humidity, there will be particle that fine particles dust going around other things like VOCs.

And actually the the the one of the more difficult ones to meet is an oxygen purity. So probably the least discussed but still important separation related to DAC is because you're capturing from such an oxygen rich stream that even if you have very good selectivity to CO2 and you minimize the amount of energy to do the separation and everything looks good, you tend to capture a not insubstantial amount of oxygen as well and quite often you can't hit the pipeline specs for oxygen.
