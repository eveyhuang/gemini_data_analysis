            "transcript": "Like because most material right now they're on the cathode and they use very low reduction potentials. If there's some way that we can accomplish it more efficiently even anodically, could be more stable because right now the these materials might degrade very fast because you have a lot of competing reactions going to be oxidation reduction. It's going to do all sorts of crazy stuff. So, uh, every material I've seen has been done cathodically directly in terms of separations like the quinones and stuff. So if there's some way that people can either bring it closer to a neutral potential or even anodically, I don't know. It's it's something I've never seen it so but somebody can correct me. Maybe there is something I haven't kept up with the literature but yeah.",

            "transcript": "Um one one reflection I've had um I guess while we're on the topic of integration of uh our multifunctional processes is um you know I think it can open many doors and the science can be quite beautiful and at the same time we create new constraints on processes um when we try to make things you know do multiple have multiple functionalities and like um many years ago I was sort of immersed in the you know like photo electrochemical conversion of CO2 and that was always I don't work in that now but it was always an interesting problem um because there's opportunities but also when you constrain material to be a you know light absorber and have to integrate catalyst and do many things then you also have a narrower I mean by some arguments could have a narrower uh parameter space and I think you know one of the beautiful things about um sorbents and things that kind of already have affinities for CO2 is they can create really neat new mechanisms and then one of the challenges is they're not at all designed to be like friendly with if it's an electrochemical process just to keep with the example. You know they're they're bulky they have steric issues they don't want to you know so I think um they can thwart your ionic conductivity or sometimes they do become ionic conductors and so I've been thinking a lot about how you kind of you kind of have to have your eye on both um on that challenge in the beginning because you can inadvertently make a very complex system and then and then you have to figure out maybe why it doesn't work can take quite some time.",

            "transcript": "So I I think this is a very nice point and I share your experience. I started with photo electrochemical CO2 reduction and after about two years I was like I'm not integrating everything on one thing and I took it apart. Maybe you know the literature. Um but so what I want to ask here is about this integration. Uh so I want to build on on Betar's argument because integration has pros and cons and I would really like to hear what people think. So the pros of integrating is if you integrate um capture and conversion, you can make products that potentially can be transported better, more easily. Um CO2 is a gas, ideally we could make a liquid, it would be easier to kind of gather together and and transport to a point of use. On on the other hand, um if we integrate capture and conversion, capture is not the very high intensity process. The CO2 is at 400 ppm, we need to pump immense amounts of air through the absorbers to get meaningful mole molar quantities of carbon dioxide. And then if we want to do conversion at the same site, my concern is that we will under utilize, for example, the catalytic or chemic or electro catalytic conversion system because we end up having the need of of transporting electrons through very large surface areas if we want to do the conversion directly on the absorbent, right? Which is really massive when you look at the systems built by Climeworks. And um so it it comes kind of down again to the same question like isn't it from an engineering point of view more reasonable to intensify the conversion process to essentially concentrate the CO2 up and then separately kind of do the conversion in a more intensified process than the capture. And I I would really like to hear the thoughts of people about this.",

            "transcript": "Uh I'm I'm not the engineer first of all. So uh um you know when I'm thinking about this about the CO2 concentration, what I've been thinking is um you know is it is it possible you know first of all it's it's definitely true that we will need more sorbent size than the conversion side, right? Because of the diluted concentration of carbon dioxide if we want to do direct air capture. So to increase the the amount of size for capture, would it be possible that um a structure like a my cell or any kind of vesicle that the the peripheral positions can be used for capture and then a catalyst can sit in the center of of the my cell for the the conversion or or some some architectures like that. Like like the dendrimer structure or or sort of things like that. Just just my rough idea.",

            "transcript": "Oh I I guess one one uh question I've always had um is whether um and again uh in general but also for electrochemical driven um CO2 is uh is it better to have that as an absorber? Like so you have your species sort of somehow homogeneously dispersed in a liquid and then you pump the CO2 as a gas or is it always better to have absorbents? So is it like from mass transfer perspective uh to have it heterogeneous? Because the one problem is uh in developing absorbents um and you want to do something that's not uh thermal then you have to somehow have conductivity and no liquid and that's been a big challenge as well.",

Like what what what types of um standard standardization and metrics and reporting would we need to get answers to those questions.",

            "transcript": "Because I've noticed the the conversation often focuses a lot on um thermodynamic assessments and minimum work and or even demonstrated electrical work, which is one part of the picture but the the total um CO2 volumes for example could be quite small and they're tested in very, you know, very disparate conditions and just to harken back to um one analogy that was brought up in the main session is like for I'm also I have a foot in the battery world and um the community you know that field is very far along in terms of commercialization at scale but um even now like at a an academic level there's still great need and journals are pushing for like that you report basic things about how you like like in photovoltaics, right? But um that's not even not established for batteries. How you report things, what you report, how do you how do you really assess performance and I I'm thinking a lot about that here because I think sometimes you can get great um selectivity but you might have puny amounts of CO2 um that are ultra mass transport limited and and it might not even be apparent someone might not even report that or know to report it. So um that was a long rambling comment but I think maybe I'll just leave it as a hypothetical question. I struggle to answer it myself.",
