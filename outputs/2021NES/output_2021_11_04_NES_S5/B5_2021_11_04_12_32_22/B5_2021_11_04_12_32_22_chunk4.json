So if you study adsorption and optimize adsorption in isolation and don't study it coupled with desorption or conversion depending on how you're going to do it, all of those parts are interconnected. And so it's good to do parts on six different pieces of the whole puzzle but then as you think about pulling together collaborations and proposals that you might want to write, if you can pull together teams that can look at an integrated whole it'll be far more impactful and quite often if you optimize individual pieces and put them together it's not a global optimum.",

I think there's a lot of questions uh and even reactor design you might revisit if you want to the conversion in the same reactor for say.

I don't think a lot of people have looked at contactors that are optimized for both capture and conversion maybe to some degree for thermal conversion.

So as I mentioned there's a reason they want to co locate the storage site with the deck so that you don't need to get permit and a new pipeline for CO2. But let's think about conversion. If you're making chemicals and fuels or or intermediates or construction materials, what is harder to transport? I think that's the question we need to have. So if you're making uh construction materials, we don't want to ship this long distance because it takes energy, right? So you might want to be closer to where you're going to build buildings, right?",
