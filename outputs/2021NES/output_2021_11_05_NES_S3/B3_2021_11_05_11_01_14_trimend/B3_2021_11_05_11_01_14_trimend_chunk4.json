            "transcript": "would be very beneficial. This is to study for example the evolution of the mineral interfaces to identify for example molecules that could enhance the dissolution and therefore make all these processes faster and more feasible also. Then also studies at the interfaces could be related to the precipitation because generally mineral carbonation is performed that there is a silicate minerals that is dissolved produces calcium and magnesium ions that then react with CO2 and they produce carbonates. So there are two surface control processes where would be interesting to essentially combine experiments and and modeling. Regarding also if one would like to see other aspects of CO2 mineralization and see the potential of this process also to recover or to have some benefits that go beyond CO2 storage for CO2 mineralization more recently people are thinking using brines. Brines produce water, geothermal brines, salt lake brines. And so these are very complex water with high salinity. And so we don't only want to take calcium and magnesium to precipitate carbonates but we could and then essentially dispose of all the rest but in this rest there are valuable elements. And so we could membranes for example that could allow to have an effective separation of low concentration elements like lithium, manganese, copper, cobalt and there are so would be very they would would be very interesting to do research in this field. The challenges are the low concentration, the complexity of the brine and the salinity. But the concentration are such that could be an interesting let's say coupling CO2 mineralization and mining of valuable elements. So this is where I can see in this my field of work where I can see the importance to study interfaces interfacial processes.",

All that chemistry happens at the interface where you have lots of different species mixing together and interacting with each other.",
