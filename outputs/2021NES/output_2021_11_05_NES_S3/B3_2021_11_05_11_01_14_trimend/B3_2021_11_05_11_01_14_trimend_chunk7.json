So challenges so one of the things we kind of talked about a lot was um sort of these gaps between computational predictions and experiments synthesis takes time uh predicted structures may not actually be synthetically accessible. So basically like you know so we have all these machine learning things are great but like actually keeping it connected to what experimentalists are actually can do on a reasonable time scale. We also talked about the gap between lab scale and application scale um and then these degradation processes I think we were talking about towards the end. So these reversibility cyclability issues the fact that many of these I think particularly in the the sorbents function as sort of these non-equilibrium conditions like this part of how they work is that you know you're you're you're you're changing um their operating conditions and then does that contribute to these degradation processes. Um I don't know if there's more here to add am I missing anything?",

So there was like the discussion that we had unexplored physical phenomenon to be to be explored for under explored physical phenomenon for sorption and storage. So there was the discussion of temperature pressure electrochemical capture and release and other triggers that could be used like light and whether or not that would be practical and then Jared mentioned humidity swings.",
