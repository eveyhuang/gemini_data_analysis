It's multi-step and then sometimes it requires like three or four steps, so um it's hard to do materials discovery is the same same thing with the moths, but it's easier if it's it's probably easier to optimize. If you have a one platform and you're just changing one small group, it's easier, but it's a lot of work compared to the amount of data they they they can they need yeah.",

I was just going to piggy back on what Xiao said about you know, if we're going to use sort of sort of computational machine learning to identify targets, having some sort of feasibility criterion would be useful. I don't know if they can uh maybe one way is to like use like materials that have already been reported as synthesized as like training sets for for for the feasibility criterion if they um come up with identify a material that based on like the affinity tests or whatever are, you know, looks promising.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, just to uh add on to that. it's very interesting to know about how how these uh uh compounds on polymers are being sort of synthesized in an experimental setup. and I'm curious to know when you do these, I know you have a specific set of candidate compounds that you start working from and make changes. I just wonder is is there sort of a limitation from the experimental framework about these specific new uh new synthesis are sort of incremental. In other words, I wonder when you when you sort of generate a large set of these new compounds, are they sort of um are they sort of small modifications to the candidate materials or do you have certain set of design principles that can help you narrow down your space group and uh sort of project or sort of kind of guide the synthesis of the new compounds. So the kind of any sort of design principles that exist in between which perhaps a computationalist could shed light on is that something uh are there some open questions in that area?",

            "transcript": "I think that's a that's I think that's a hard question because it also depends on the area and the type of materials you're talking about. The moths is going to be a different answer from we're talking about some electrochemical sorbents. So I can talk about electrochemical sorbents because it's the ones that I've seen more. And uh I would say that uh there's very few design principles because uh the way that people have taken them, they've taken them for energy storage materials. So the these are materials that weren't originally designed to be separation materials and there's a very limited amount of materials. So like let's say uh for some other things you can like uh amino resins you can have maybe hundreds of them. for redox groups you perhaps at most would have five that are stable. it's very limited. So you can make small functionalizations on them but uh uh basic redox transfer uh is limited to very few species. So um yeah, but that's I'm just speaking for certain polymers.",

            "transcript": "So I I have a question on that that front. So so I find the point that there be being fewer design principles because of of instability as I'm understanding it from a redox perspective interesting. Um and so I'm assuming that you're talking about um the the redox stability of organic monomers is is that the case here? So so what is the problem with using inorganic components in your in your electrochemical sorbents because when you're thinking about redox activity inorganic aspects are going to I mean a lot of inorganic molecules are governed by the same changes in basicity as you you change the oxidation state of the overall assembly and so from absorbent perspective to me that would seem like a natural way to pivot if instability is a challenge.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, actually just just throwing out like a crazy hypothesis there because most of the uh electrochem sorbents that people look at quinones things, they're organic and there's two problems there. One is the stability and also one is the uh the area, I think the mass transfer and the kinetics because these are 2D materials, they're not very porous. So if somebody could make something that's inorganic that is redox active and CO2 capture CO2, it would actually um it could potentially uh overcome stability problems as also you can make them more porous too. because it's very hard to make the polymers porous but you can make inorganic materials porous.",

Uh, but um I agree that um often there is a a mismatch between uh computation and experiment because of for example presence somebody say at some point of impurity or comunque or anyway aspects related to the natural property of material that are not account in the model. So I think it's important in these cases really to um work on both aspects modeling um for description large scale but also at the molecular scale and experiments.",
