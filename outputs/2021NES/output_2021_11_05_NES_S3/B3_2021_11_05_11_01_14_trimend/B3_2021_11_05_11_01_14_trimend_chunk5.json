Not so much necessarily on direct process integration, but more something that has to be considered I guess as part of that that doesn't receive that much attention on materials characterization side, which is just thermal conductivity and like managing heat during absorption and desorption processes. Um particularly for solid absorbents, but I assume for liquid spirits as well. Um and I think particularly when you're thinking about thermal swing type processes for absorbing and desorbing CO2, you're kind of there's intrinsic kind of thermodynamic inefficiencies that are kind of built into what you're doing. Um so like absorbing CO2 is always going to be exothermic. Um and that's going to heat up your material and when your material gets hot, it's going to absorb less CO2 in almost every case.",

I think uh two of the big systems level problems that we have or at least maybe divide first in the device level is um um you usually need uh an electrolyte and a liquid um and that if you're bubbling something through, you have a lot of mass transfer challenges. So I think one of the big challenges of actually implementing is figuring out ways to do it with a direct gas phase sorbent that has electric electronic conductivity without the need for a liquid electrolyte.",

So there are different phase that you can go through and I mean, I'm a process engineer also as a background.
