But we can also use",

            "transcript": "that the efficiency could be acceptable that we have the material that we can use it. Sorption and desorption we have to figure out this one and then we can scale up. And Professor Wilcox most of the time gives a book that is called Alchemy Alchemy of Air that talks about ammonia production. And so there was these two scientists chemistry I believe they were they were, you know, Haber Bosch and they just created then currently Haber Bosch process and they created one drop of ammonia and they said yeah but we cannot do anything with one drop of ammonia and then they said okay chemical engineer will talk about, you know, they will think about how to scale up the process. So I believe that now the most important part is to find really a way to to find the right material and to find the right approach to get better and to achieve higher performance and then maybe we can think about process intensification and scaling up. And there are still a lot of basic research that we have to do and we have to dig in. Although I'm working on process intensification since a while combining catalyst and separation in the same unit. So complete in the same unit and we are going to decrease temperature, you're going to increase decrease temperature, pressure, increase the you know, increase efficiency. And yes for direct air capture, I don't think that the pressure is the main you know, or the concentration of CO2 because we are talking about 400 part per million and so if you would like to pump something and use the driving pressure, the driving force of CO2 through a membrane through a separation process I don't think it's going to work. Very well so we have to think maybe to something else and we have only 10 minutes so we can just wrap up and I'm going to shut up.",
