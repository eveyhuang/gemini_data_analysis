So like a hydrogen, you can speed up the relative rate of a hydrogenation to a CC bond cleavage that wouldn't directly be influenced by the the potential or maybe only in a very kind of indirect way by the field or something. Um so so you can definitely get selectivity enhancements but then there's there's trade offs with that because then you can get like parasitic hydrogen evolution instead of the the hydrogenation you're trying to carry out.

So what you can do with catalysis, yes, we can increase the selectivity but then we will have some trade off and what I'm doing right now is doing the reaction and just separating what product of the reaction in the same time that the reaction is taking place.

So as soon as the product is formed, you're going to separate so you're going to push more the production of the second product. So for example, I'm working on a hydrogen production, sure, starting from hydrocarbon, sure. And so we have some um reaction that are thermodynamic constraint as you know, water gas shift reaction or meeting steam reforming reaction. Sure, they're coming from fossil fuel but could be any kind of other hydrocarbon. And as soon as the reaction is taking place, you're going to form CO2 and hydrogen. Hydrogen is separated. So the reaction is moved forwards to more you know, um react react products formation. And so you can create two streams at the end, one that is pure hydrogen and the second one that is pure CO2 and with CO2 you can do whatever you want because because it's also at high pressure. So designing a catalyst, yes, but I believe is not the designing of the catalyst. We have also to think about the overall box and say, okay, we can do something more on that one because I was thinking, okay, I can improve, I can improve like you know, the efficiency of the catalyst, okay, bigger surface area, how can I spread out, you know, we have always the same material and how can I spread out all the active catalyst on that material, it's amazing.

We just got a new proposal doing that. Um and but another one and this comes to something Fic said, I believe Fic said it. Um when you have a really deeply endothermic reaction um so like water splitting if you just did thermolysis, it's an impractically high temperature but you can break it into multiple reactions uh at lower temperatures for various trade offs. So it's second design principle to push you maybe uh to out of the box to think in terms of is how do you sort of split one reaction that might be really hard sometimes into multiple reactions that are easier and can be manipulated uh differently and also get your separations like uh splitting water, the oxygen and hydrogen happening in two different reactions.

We're trying to move away from you know, coal fired or or whatever process we're using to get to the electricity. So say you start with electricity, the question is then should I pump that directly into a process or could I turn that into heat and use heat? And the the Praveen asked for something articulate. I'm I'm going to be very inarticulate because I haven't completely thought this through but but you know, you can always turn the electricity into heat for basically unit efficiency. Um, I think in some cases if you're not trying to drive against too large of a gradient that the electricity might be most effectively used for pumping heat because you can do that at higher efficiency than just turning it directly into heat, but then there's some auxiliary hardware and and maybe, you know, the actual don't work out.

And so there was these two scientists chemistry I believe they were they were, you know, Haber Bosch and they just created then currently Haber Bosch process and they created one drop of ammonia and they said yeah but we cannot do anything with one drop of ammonia and then they said okay chemical engineer will talk about, you know, they will think about how to scale up the process. So I believe that now the most important part is to find really a way to to find the right material and to find the right approach to get better and to achieve higher performance and then maybe we can think about process intensification and scaling up.

So complete in the same unit and we are going to decrease temperature, you're going to increase decrease temperature, pressure, increase the you know, increase efficiency. And yes for direct air capture, I don't think that the pressure is the main you know, or the concentration of CO2 because we are talking about 400 part per million and so if you would like to pump something and use the driving pressure, the driving force of CO2 through a membrane through a separation process I don't think it's going to work.
