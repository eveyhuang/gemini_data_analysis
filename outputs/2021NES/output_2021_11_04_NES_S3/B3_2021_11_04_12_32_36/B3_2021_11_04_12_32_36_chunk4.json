So it's not, you know, people the fields that I work on, people think that if you're, you know, if you're changing the system, you're just doing engineering, right? That's just, you know, and you know, applied work, right? Uh, what you know, it's coming out here is that there's a there are fundamental drivers in uh thinking about the environment and what you do with the environment can manipulate the kinetics or even the thermodynamics depending on what you do and that's where the separation topic is, but there's a theme of environment uh consider more broadly than uh just the catalyst. So how do you go about that? I mean, you know, that seems like a lot of parameters to worry about. Have you given any thought ever have you ever encountered that issue basically?",

But you know, the idea of using machine learning um to look at even just design of experiments, which parameters should I use? What's the sensitivity of all these different parameters? What's the ranges and how should I, you know, vary them, right? Because it should be unbiased hopefully in the way you're doing it. That's one side of it. The other side that I've been interested in with more some work I've been doing in um paralysis with some people at Cornell was, you know, in all these systems and and this these systems as well is you don't have one simple reaction, right? You have multiple different reactions occurring, um side reactions, who knows what's going on in your system. Is there ways that we can look at a surrogate or some sort of exemplar reaction or part of the reactions and use data to get something out of that, right? So if we have a lot of unknowns, we have a lot of things going on, are there ways to identify some critical aspects that you can can kind of focus on and maybe make progress that way, which I don't have a good answer to yet, but the idea of using, you know, machine learning and AI and data mining to do that, I think is interesting for for this problem and for like the broader class of problems.",

I don't really want to go into that just yet. But I think to uh Eva, your your point, another way you can figure that out is dimensionless groups, right? So for a long time chemical engineers when they're talking about scaling processes have thought about varying dimensionless groups that describe um dominating processes in different length scales and in different regimes, right? And it it's really useful to Simona's point about design of experiment, right? Because you know, if you have a hypothesis about what's going on, you can make scaling arguments to say, well, if this process was going on, this is about the rate I think it would be happening or this is the likelihood of this process occurring. Um so some of that I think already exists, it just would be useful to apply um um to these newer kinds of problems. Often times, you know, they're buried in undergraduate textbooks and you know, people don't normally pull them out.",

So what I think is that is important to understand the non linearity of the system. The fundamental non linearities and in both in modeling and experiments start to uh describe or test the system in a way that you exclude some variables and then you increase the complexity identifying then the dominant mechanism. So then maybe uh other AI could could be used but I think the first approach to really understand one should start to identify sample system that you can describe and then describe the non linearity as you increase the complexity.",
