And my research interested uh broadly in the area of semiconducting materials. So we develop new hybrid organic inorganic hybrid materials for efficient photovoltaic so that I can hopefully to contribute uh to the negative emission science in the area of solar driven CO2 reduction. And I hope to engage in this meeting to collaborate with people who is uh who has different background with me. Thank you.",

And my research focus is more related to energy production, in particular hydrogen production in membrane reactor, that are kind of device that combine catalysis and separation at the same time. So the idea is to make hydrogen from a feed stock that is can be any kind of hydrocarbon from fossil fuel renewable fuel and at the same time we're going to capture CO2 via different methods like mineral carbonation or fish synthesis. So it's important to highlight that I'm working more on metallic and synthesis and developing metallic membranes and I'm more involved on um catalyst related to fish synthesis and everything is done at high temperature, sorry.

So it's a catalysis theme and I interpret this personally, you can interpret however you want, um as you know, the of the many ways that we're going to have to, you know, do chemical transformations related to negative emissions. Um are there elements that cut across and that are challenges no matter what? Um are there elements where you would want to go one way versus another way? Um and so, you know, you have some if you read the breakout, there's some questions there uh that serve as prompts also for you to think about. So I'm going to give you one minute to collect your thoughts and also to get uh brave about being the first to share them. Okay?",

So selectivity, stability, um and and durability. Um and whether that's for photocatalyst, thermocatalyst or electrocatalyst, that's really what ultimately defines whether something's going to be successful or not. And then I think depending upon the way the driving force is delivered, um be it sunlight photo, um be it, you know, thermo so heat, uh be it electro, so, you know, potential, that determines sort of the way the catalyst can be used, so the way it's structured, think about reactor design, right? There's ways you design reactors for thermocatalysts that you couldn't really design for so easily for say photocatalysts, right? Um, and once you start getting into sort of the design or how these materials can be used, that's when transport starts to play a significant role in terms of sort of driving this along. So I I tend to think that you know, there might be a generalized theme um across these different driving forces and if you build from the catalyst and sort of build from catalyst to implementation.

Um electrical energy is a little bit higher quality, you can in principle get almost all of it out as work where if you know, you have heat, you have like a carnal limit kind of thing.
