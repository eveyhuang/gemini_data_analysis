So there's obviously a ton of electrocatalysis work. Um is there a way I've also seen electro based approaches for regenerating sorbents let's say. Uh is there a way to integrate a piece of the separations puzzle electrochemically with electrochemical catalysis in the sense that when I as a thermal catalysis uh as a person that primarily does thermal catalysis, I think of providing let's say hydrogen at a high temperature to catalyze CO2 reduction let's say while I'm desorbing CO2 off or when I have CO2 uh on a solvent surface. Is there a way to provide an electrocatalytic input uh during the separation step after you've",

So it's a little bit challenge with polymers and work with electrochemistry at the same time. So reaction separation takes taking at the same place could be more challenge.

And so you have scale by area, right? And so if you have smaller systems that works well as you start to have very large systems, thermochemistry looks better because it's easier to heat and retain heat and in many cases either three-dimensional reaction zone. So it's kind of a cube squared law if you've ever heard about that where",

            "transcript": "you know, as you get bigger and bigger, three-dimensional reaction spaces become increasingly attractive, right? Um, I think one of the things though that is really interesting, um, I think Simona was touching on this maybe a little bit is the coupling of those in that there are some processes that are significantly easier and probably better to do thermochemically and there are some processes that are kind of challenging to do thermochemically and can be done electrochemically. This kind of goes to Adam's one of Adam's first points about what reactions to do electrochemically versus thermochemically, right? And so I think often times we we sometimes get ourselves confused and it could also be sort of how we sit within the innovation spectrum. Um, these things are often thought of as an either or and not an and, right? So you don't have to pick thermochemistry or electrochemistry, you can do more than one and I think this goes back to a point that Ellen was making about breaking it up into different primary steps and saying if I want to go from point A to point B, do I need to do it in one reactor that can do everything or can I do substeps in different reactors using different driving forces and get to something more efficient that way.",

So uh I hate to put you guys on the hot seat, but maybe uh you know, you thought about it in your initial um you can either pull the thread, build on anything that has already been talked about or introduce something entirely new that you know, maybe you you know, you had jotted down in that first minute.

            "transcript": "Uh sure. Um, the thing that I'm still kind of caught up on going back to the idea of how complex some of these heterogeneous materials are, if we're thinking about catalyst design is whether it's even feasible to take systems that are that complex where you have heterogeneous surfaces where in reality you have I don't know, hundreds of different fundamental little entities that you would call catalyst. Um, how feasible it is to design true model systems that you could characterize kind of traditionally and you know, correlate to theory to get some type of rational um, you know, design rules for systems like that. I I think it's a that's a type of thinking that's very appealing to chemists because we want to rationally understand everything at a molecular level, but in a lot of systems a true molecular system isn't going to even be um feasible and whatever design principles you design you can derive from a small molecule catalyst isn't really going to be applicable. Um, so for systems like that, you know, is a is it a case where there needs to be some type of bridging between synthesis where you're synthesizing perhaps slightly cleaner systems but are still still reasonably complex and from the actual experimental and characterization side where you can get down and probe what's going on at much more well-defined species within those complex architectures. There, you made me talk. Okay.",

Uh, I was thinking to utilize the solar energy to couple the photovoltaic system and the electrochemical system to generate um uh the system that have higher efficiency from solar to hydrocarbon conversion. Um, in the sense that uh we can build up very um cheap and uh earth abundant um photovoltaic system to compare with very traditional silicon or uh three five semiconducting uh material system.",
