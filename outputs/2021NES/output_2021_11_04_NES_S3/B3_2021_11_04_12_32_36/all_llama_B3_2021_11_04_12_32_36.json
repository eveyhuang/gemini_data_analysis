So the idea is to make hydrogen from a feed stock that is can be any kind of hydrocarbon from fossil fuel renewable fuel and at the same time we're going to capture CO2 via different methods like mineral carbonation or fish synthesis. So it's important to highlight that I'm working more on metallic and synthesis and developing metallic membranes and I'm more involved on um catalyst related to fish synthesis and everything is done at high temperature, sorry.

And then I think depending upon the way the driving force is delivered, um be it sunlight photo, um be it, you know, thermo so heat, uh be it electro, so, you know, potential, that determines sort of the way the catalyst can be used, so the way it's structured, think about reactor design, right? There's ways you design reactors for thermocatalysts that you couldn't really design for so easily for say photocatalysts, right? Um, and once you start getting into sort of the design or how these materials can be used, that's when transport starts to play a significant role in terms of sort of driving this along. So I I tend to think that you know, there might be a generalized theme um across these different driving forces and if you build from the catalyst and sort of build from catalyst to implementation.

Um electrical energy is a little bit higher quality, you can in principle get almost all of it out as work where if you know, you have heat, you have like a carnal limit kind of thing.

So like a hydrogen, you can speed up the relative rate of a hydrogenation to a CC bond cleavage that wouldn't directly be influenced by the the potential or maybe only in a very kind of indirect way by the field or something. Um so so you can definitely get selectivity enhancements but then there's there's trade offs with that because then you can get like parasitic hydrogen evolution instead of the the hydrogenation you're trying to carry out.

So what you can do with catalysis, yes, we can increase the selectivity but then we will have some trade off and what I'm doing right now is doing the reaction and just separating what product of the reaction in the same time that the reaction is taking place.

Some most of the times I was like, Simona, we can, you're going to violate the second level of thermodynamics. I was like, yes, because it's just an open system. So as soon as the product is formed, you're going to separate so you're going to push more the production of the second product. So for example, I'm working on a hydrogen production, sure, starting from hydrocarbon, sure. And so we have some um reaction that are thermodynamic constraint as you know, water gas shift reaction or meeting steam reforming reaction. Sure, they're coming from fossil fuel but could be any kind of other hydrocarbon. And as soon as the reaction is taking place, you're going to form CO2 and hydrogen. Hydrogen is separated. So the reaction is moved forwards to more you know, um react react products formation. And so you can create two streams at the end, one that is pure hydrogen and the second one that is pure CO2 and with CO2 you can do whatever you want because because it's also at high pressure. So designing a catalyst, yes, but I believe is not the designing of the catalyst. We have also to think about the overall box and say, okay, we can do something more on that one because I was thinking, okay, I can improve, I can improve like you know, the efficiency of the catalyst, okay, bigger surface area, how can I spread out, you know, we have always the same material and how can I spread out all the active catalyst on that material, it's amazing.

We just got a new proposal doing that. Um and but another one and this comes to something Fic said, I believe Fic said it. Um when you have a really deeply endothermic reaction um so like water splitting if you just did thermolysis, it's an impractically high temperature but you can break it into multiple reactions uh at lower temperatures for various trade offs. So it's second design principle to push you maybe uh to out of the box to think in terms of is how do you sort of split one reaction that might be really hard sometimes into multiple reactions that are easier and can be manipulated uh differently and also get your separations like uh splitting water, the oxygen and hydrogen happening in two different reactions.

What's the ranges and how should I, you know, vary them, right? Because it should be unbiased hopefully in the way you're doing it. That's one side of it. The other side that I've been interested in with more some work I've been doing in um paralysis with some people at Cornell was, you know, in all these systems and and this these systems as well is you don't have one simple reaction, right? You have multiple different reactions occurring, um side reactions, who knows what's going on in your system. Is there ways that we can look at a surrogate or some sort of exemplar reaction or part of the reactions and use data to get something out of that, right? So if we have a lot of unknowns, we have a lot of things going on, are there ways to identify some critical aspects that you can can kind of focus on and maybe make progress that way, which I don't have a good answer to yet, but the idea of using, you know, machine learning and AI and data mining to do that, I think is interesting for for this problem and for like the broader class of problems.",

So for a long time chemical engineers when they're talking about scaling processes have thought about varying dimensionless groups that describe um dominating processes in different length scales and in different regimes, right? And it it's really useful to Simona's point about design of experiment, right? Because you know, if you have a hypothesis about what's going on, you can make scaling arguments to say, well, if this process was going on, this is about the rate I think it would be happening or this is the likelihood of this process occurring. Um so some of that I think already exists, it just would be useful to apply um um to these newer kinds of problems.

This kind of goes to Adam's one of Adam's first points about what reactions to do electrochemically versus thermochemically, right? And so I think often times we we sometimes get ourselves confused and it could also be sort of how we sit within the innovation spectrum. Um, these things are often thought of as an either or and not an and, right?

Um, how feasible it is to design true model systems that you could characterize kind of traditionally and you know, correlate to theory to get some type of rational um, you know, design rules for systems like that. I I think it's a that's a type of thinking that's very appealing to chemists because we want to rationally understand everything at a molecular level, but in a lot of systems a true molecular system isn't going to even be um feasible and whatever design principles you design you can derive from a small molecule catalyst isn't really going to be applicable. Um, so for systems like that, you know, is a is it a case where there needs to be some type of bridging between synthesis where you're synthesizing perhaps slightly cleaner systems but are still still reasonably complex and from the actual experimental and characterization side where you can get down and probe what's going on at much more well-defined species within those complex architectures.

And so sometimes if let's say you can break out the slow step into a different reactor, just make that one way bigger, right? And then you can drive whatever process you need, but if it's all in the same reactor, you're kind of stuck at that slow step.

So, uh I haven't in my mind, I mean I've read papers, many papers about these integrated approaches, but in my mind I haven't seen the specific advantage of having a single step capture and conversion process especially direct air capture and conversion process articulated.

We're trying to move away from you know, coal fired or or whatever process we're using to get to the electricity. So say you start with electricity, the question is then should I pump that directly into a process or could I turn that into heat and use heat? And the the Praveen asked for something articulate. I'm I'm going to be very inarticulate because I haven't completely thought this through but but you know, you can always turn the electricity into heat for basically unit efficiency. Um, I think in some cases if you're not trying to drive against too large of a gradient that the electricity might be most effectively used for pumping heat because you can do that at higher efficiency than just turning it directly into heat, but then there's some auxiliary hardware and and maybe, you know, the actual don't work out. But but the framework I would always think in terms of is I have this many units of electrical energy, is it better to pump them directly into the process or to siphon some off to to pump heat in or turn them into heat and with with that process do any better.",

So I believe that now the most important part is to find really a way to to find the right material and to find the right approach to get better and to achieve higher performance and then maybe we can think about process intensification and scaling up. And there are still a lot of basic research that we have to do and we have to dig in. Although I'm working on process intensification since a while combining catalyst and separation in the same unit. So complete in the same unit and we are going to decrease temperature, you're going to increase decrease temperature, pressure, increase the you know, increase efficiency. And yes for direct air capture, I don't think that the pressure is the main you know, or the concentration of CO2 because we are talking about 400 part per million and so if you would like to pump something and use the driving pressure, the driving force of CO2 through a membrane through a separation process I don't think it's going to work.
