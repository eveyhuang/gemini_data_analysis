Um there's there's not a lot of really fundamental reason to use one source of energy versus the other. Um it it always ends up being something about what's what's available there, you know, is there heat from something nearby or I don't have a good beyond the the uphill aspect, I don't have like a good rule of thumb for that.",

Um in my experience, people seem to sort of equate electrocatalysis and photocatalysis and and think that, you know, if you design a really good electrocatalyst, you can use it for photocatalysis and vice versa, it's easy to switch between. Um but I think there's a lot of challenges in terms of reaction conditions, again going to the comment of uh local reaction environment that make that really problematic. So, um maybe some additional recognition that it's not always super appropriate to just be switching uh between different input methods.",

It's cleverly titled. Um so if you want to go in and look at they're five minutes long, that's what I asked people to do and I've looked at a couple so far and they're quite interesting.
