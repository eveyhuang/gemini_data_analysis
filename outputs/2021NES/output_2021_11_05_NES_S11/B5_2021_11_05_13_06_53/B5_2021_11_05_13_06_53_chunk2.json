And if you actually ask experimentalists very likely they have very little understanding of what is the mass transport inside of those sort of systems and how that couples to kinetics. And then so you're essentially left trying to justify some experimental observations when the experimental observations are really deviated from or affected simply by the geometry of the reactor. So that's where this multi-scale modeling right? I'm interested in this multi-scale modeling. I would like to to see theory that is I read papers and sometimes they they have a big component of theory but I do not really learn a lot because it's matches the results and say yes this will explain them right? And I think every time that I see thermodynamics I'm okay with with the calculations when I see the use of DFT to do kinetics that's when I start to see a lot of red flags because many times I think we don't even understand the reactors that we're using. So I don't know if that contributes to the discussion but.",

So being able being able to compare apples to apples or pears to pears or whatever you want to call between experiment and theory is crucial because there will always be errors both in experiments and in theory. I mean like this is not like we're doing science but nothing is really the absolute truth in the end because we're contributing and it's changing over time right. So at each point we just need to ask ourselves are we comparing the same things right? And what what is needed in a model or in an experiment what is in the experiment that the model needs to actually take into account right? And that's not always clear and we're always oversimplifying right. So how do you as you ask how do you bridge the gaps between these two communities to actually be able to do appropriate comparisons? Is that my interpretation of what you is that correct?",

And absolutely. So in many of the I do electrocatalysis and then you would think that many of these electrochemical cells should be considered isothermal. In reality these are adiabatic systems. So if you have energy needs to come from somewhere so the overpotential perhaps is just doing that in many of the electrochemical transformations. So how do you how can we work with theory I think theory should also be more critical with the people that do experiments and push them to actually explain yeah.",

What is the actual overall goal that we're trying to achieve? So I know that there are a number of you know individuals here that do very different type of modeling at very different length I mean like we have I'm just going to call some people out right we have Rebecca who is really at the quantum scale she's dealing with excitations and you know all that and then we have who should I call at the top of my here Ananya you're talking about you know really a very different length and and time scales right.
