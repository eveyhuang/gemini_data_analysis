Can you look at this type of mechanism where where something there is a time scale for that molecule to actually land from the top into a carbon species or something on the surface. And I think that's also a challenge. So those kinetics, if those kinetics are relevant to the mechanism, then the question is how do you capture them in in in in in a model. And and again, this is not a critique, obviously the field is advancing slowly, slowly, slowly. Uh but but I think yeah, I will throw dimensional analysis as a as a keyword for the people that are trying to bridge multiple scales.",

Gases, I think you guys have a much better handling handle on on how things are happening because now you're really limited by by diffusion processes. The convection is not perhaps as significant but in electrochemistry, aqueous electrochemistry that's the case. And then so we have used the same cell for nitrate reduction, methane reduction, uh uh CO2 electrochemistry, CO electrochemistry and all of them behave exactly on the same way in a dimensionless scale when you account for the diffusion coefficients, the the difference for example in the solubility of the different molecules in the bulk of the electrolyte. Uh so I think so that's sort of the strength of uh of dimensionless analysis that it is really doesn't care what is the molecule that you're putting in. But and yet it allows you to to describe that relation of how is it that mass moves towards the surface, towards a surface and then how is it that the products that you make move away. Uh is that that does answer your question Aleksandra?",

So what I'm trying to understand is because ultimately what we're trying to do, whatever model that we we have at hand, we want to be able for it to be somehow transferable between different systems, between different reactants or different type of materials. And ultimately if we have that transferability, we want to use it for some kind of a prediction, right? So in my opinion, transferability comes first and then you have some kind of a prediction. So that was why I was just wondering since I'm you know I've read about it but I'm not as knowledgeable so thank you for you know sharing that.",

            "transcript": "I think a nice example of what Carlos was just saying is is like typically these dimensionless numbers talk about like competing processes, right? So rate of reaction to rate of diffusion for example. So if we find that number to be very high, it's it's very evident that the process is diffusion limited which means that your model can focus on the diffusion limited part of the system rather than the reaction which is less relevant. I think there's a beauty in in looking at dimensionless number and using that to guide modeling.",

So even though you you're looking at diffusion, right, that is already diffusion in a space where where that has already been affected by by what is happening at the next scale, right?

So you can generate different products at the same potential. So even doing voltammetry and looking just at the the flow of current is not not not enough in that case. You also need to actually see how is the those electrons are being distributed into the into different branches of molecules. When you only have one process that you know that effectively where your electrons are going, right, or what is it that you're making, uh that that is is is true. Once you start to have uh difference in products, you're making if you take carbon dioxide and you're trying to make a fuel or a chemical, then those products that you make, right, then they will not all of them consume the same number of electrons.

I'm also wondering whether in these experiments that you conduct if you can isolate certain mechanisms so that when we're building sort of a model, we know exactly what the the coefficient that you're measuring whether it's for example a diffusion coefficient is if you have more than one species if you're able to isolate those uh either the mechanism that you're working on or you're able to kind of extract coefficients which are either thermodynamically controlled or kinetically controlled which will help in constructing a model.",

And and and so when you look at intrinsic kinetics at the surface of the electrode in the same way, you can also study what that those changes in temperature actually what are the effects of those changes in temperature into the the the absorption rates. I we cannot measure absorptions, right? We just look at products going in going coming out, right? But you can do electrochemistry at the same potential at different temperatures. So yeah, maybe you can get an insight into the thermal steps and electrochemical steps. But but yeah, by having for example the same applied potential but doing experiments in the different conditions of hydrodynamics, then you can start to actually uh introduce better models or better equations that describe the system and the different relations because effectively you're changing not in the same way the concentration of molecules at the at the reactive side.",
