So I think that that is definitely a big challenge that we I think it's also a big opportunity. It will also tell us kind of coming back if we know what the error at the smallest scale if we truly believe that we've mapped out all of the mechanisms and all of the you know electron proton coupling steps and whatever you might be including in your model if you know what how big of an error it is at the smallest scale what would that mean for that mass transport and the kinetics and the and all of the other steps at a grain boundary or in a porous medium right?

So we had a lot of discussions in in the previous breakout room was you know a lot of these high throughput studies what they can do and what some of their limitations are and then actually introducing complexity it costs a lot. So we also need to know where to start which are the systems that we truly want to actually invest in making those extremely detailed studies right? So recognizing what the limitations at each and one of these modeling endeavors are before we take it to the next scale so to speak I think is something that is crucial.",

A few times in this conversation already DFT has kind of come up as here's the standard for small scales but one of the best known flaws of especially your cheap DFT methods that you can actually do for these surfaces is it's not good at charge transfer states and charge transfer states for any of this photocatalysis electrocatalysis type stuff are absolutely critical. And so even what we're mapping out on these smallest scales that we can do has more inaccuracies built into it than most people like to admit.",

Um but yes absolutely I think actually it is completely I wouldn't say completely but it is quite unknown what exactly the role of a coupled proton electron step versus a decoupled one is uh in these electrochemical systems in general. There are a few systems where it has been studied. There's some in the molecular catalysis or community there's a lot of work but for surfaces this is actually very a very very challenging it's a long standing challenging problem how do you include charge and how do you model that and there are some efforts of course but I think those are still big big big challenges um that that still remain which is good we have a lot of of work ahead of us.",
