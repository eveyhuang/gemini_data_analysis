      "transcript": "the limitations of DFT. Can you look at this type of mechanism where where something there is a time scale for that molecule to actually land from the top into a carbon species or something on the surface. And I think that's also a challenge. So those kinetics, if those kinetics are relevant to the mechanism, then the question is how do you capture them in a model. And and again, this is not a critique, obviously the field is advancing slowly, slowly, slowly. But but I think yeah, I will throw dimensional analysis as a as a keyword for people that are trying to bridge multiple scales.",

      "transcript": "Would you would you mind commenting so you already commented a little bit on the systems that you have looked at where you basically are changing the reacting molecules. What is transportability just in general between different types of chemistries? Like you talked about electrochemistry for you know I think I heard you say CO2, but how about other like if I would try to do just throwing it out there, methane or if I would want to do ammonia or anything else. Do you think this... yeah go ahead.",

      "transcript": "When you do that dimensionless analysis and you account for the let's say the so I want to say this is in in in aqueous system in an electrochemical cell. Gases, I think you guys have a much better handling handle on on how things are happening because now you're really limited by by diffusion processes. The convection is not perhaps as significant but in electrochemistry, aqueous electrochemistry that's the case. And then so we have used the same cell for nitrate reduction, methane reduction, CO2 electrochemistry, CO electrochemistry and all of them behave exactly on the same way in a dimensionless scale when you account for the diffusion coefficients, the the difference for example in the solubility of the different molecules in the bulk of the electrolyte. So I think so that's sort of the strength of of dimensionless analysis that it is really doesn't care what is the molecule that you're putting in but and yet it allows you to to describe that relation of how is it that mass moves towards the surface, towards a surface and then how is it that the products that you make move away. Is that does that answer your question Aleksandra?",

      "transcript": "Yeah no no so what I'm trying to understand is because ultimately what we're trying to do whatever model that we we have at hand we want to be able for it to be somehow transferable between different systems, between different reactants or different type of materials. And ultimately if we have that transferability we want to use it for some kind of a prediction, right? So in my opinion transferability comes first and then you have some kind of a prediction, right? So that was why I was just wondering since I'm you know I've read about it but I'm not as knowledgeable so thank you for you know sharing that.",

      "timestamp": "03:05-03:38",
      "transcript": "I think a nice example of what Carlos was just saying is is like typically these dimensionless numbers talk about like competing processes, right? So rate of reaction to rate of diffusion for example. So if we find that number to be very high it's it's very evident that the process is diffusion limited which means that your model can focus on the diffusion limited part of the system rather than the reaction which is less relevant. I think there's a beauty in in looking at dimensionless numbers and using that to guide modeling.",

      "transcript": "But I I will add that that still that that that would tell you that yes, diffusion is is is limiting but at that scale and somehow the concentration of molecules that you get near the surface of the electrode will be affected by what what is happening in the convection component that is outside. So even though you you're looking at diffusion, right, that is already diffusion in a space where where that has already been affected by by what is happening at the next scale, right? That's the yeah.",
