So this was just exactly the thing that Richard just shared. Um these are some of the questions that um are out there that we could uh chat about. Um I would rather us generate our own questions rather than being limited to this of course. So um what I would suggest that we do is um that we start off with the brief introduction who you are, where you're from, um and um let's see here and what your research topic is.",

Um any objections to this or is everybody okay just trying it out? So George will also who is the other um facilitator he he's a bit he has another commitment so he will join us at some point I believe. So I'm going to just go uh from left to right on my screen and call out your names so please just say who you are again your um institution and and what you do. Um I'll just briefly say I'm Alex. Um I'm at Penn. I've been here for about five years. I'm a computational materials chemistry broadly, um physicist, catalysis, battery person, whatever you want to whatever tag you want to put on it.
