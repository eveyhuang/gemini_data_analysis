How explicit do we have to be for us to then at the end be able to predict what the what the overall performance would be at the nanometer scale or micrometer scale or whatever you want.",

      "transcript": "But I think this is a nice segue from the question Carlos was just sort of or the point Carlos was just bringing up of in molecular systems and and homogeneous systems you have well-defined architectures where you have a better handle and then you want to translate that information to some heterogeneous material. And there's the other extreme that you end up studying just perfect surfaces that are well-defined crystals, no defect sites where catalysis are typically occurring. And so where do you find that sort of intermediate of of addressing things like you're pointing out, the environment, pH, heterogeneous architectures, the presence of defect sites. And it's not clear to me that we're there at an experimental level or a theory level as a community, but that's something we're striving for and Carlos brings up the point of how fast will we move towards something like that versus be critical and hesitant to make those leaps and extensions in our ability to model and our ability to measure. And those are tough questions to address. I'm not sure.",

      "transcript": "No, definitely I agree. One of the simplest, I mean so when we're trying to model something for example a defect interaction with a diffusing species, it's still a challenge to capture what really happens in experiment when we do this in the continuum level we're again simplifying it, right? So for example you have a range of defects with complex topologies with multiple physics that interplay in that in that locality and at the end of the day we're trying to model the very simplest idealized version of this defect and then trying to understand how this affects certain fundamental if it's the diffusion kinetics we're thinking of, how does that change in the presence of a defect. But I think although it's kind of simple I still do think introducing a small seed of that heterogeneity gives us a lot of knowledge and understanding what perhaps happens in a complex system but it's but it is it is a challenge to implement that in a computational framework. And the simplest one is to sort of idealize idealize that heterogeneity I think.",

So maybe create experimentally synthetic systems that catch some part of the complexity and then compare behaviors.",

So this this topic of bridging scales has existed for a long time and multi-scale modeling has been promised on for many decades. Where do we stand today compared to you know 20, 30, 40 years ago? Is this something that is reachable, achievable now compared to 20, 30, 40 years ago? What are your thoughts on that?",

I think that we've made a lot of as we mentioned in the in the I'm not sure if you were here then yet but I think that we've all seen that there have been bridges between scales but typically one or two potentially even three scale like length scales or time scales at the time. But truly to go from the smallest to the really really longest or scales is very rare for any given process or any given whatever you're interested in looking at. So I'm just again trying to play the devil's advocate is how closer to the end goal are we and are we of course we are better positioned now than what we were before but why and what should the next steps really be for us to actually achieve this basically is what I'm trying to to kind of provoke out of of this discussion. I see Venkat has unmuted himself so feel free to",

      "transcript": "Yeah, no this has been a great discussion to listen into. So it's funny that George mentioned fusion 20 years away. It's actually a I think perfect analogy in that if you now today ask anyone working in fusion and I think there's a number of entrepreneurs working in fusion, they will definitely disagree with you strongly that it's 20 years away and Commonwealth Fusion has sort of demonstrated a lot of cool things. I think in the same sense, I think we're at a at a cusp for like multi-scale modeling to completely sort of make a big breakthrough and the key innovation I think is differentiable programming. What has become possible now is you can basically differentiate through full codes. So which means that you know Emily can build a phase field model, I could differentiate through her code and then Ananya can build something in the sort of meso scale, I can differentiate through that and then I can differentiate then through molecular dynamics. So there is a natural way in which now we can do scale bridging. And there's a there's a sort of longer article that I wrote I'll post to the chat but I think that's the the key enabler which now before you know we had to you know we all had to sort of infer output measurement to like okay what is happening at the molecular scale or the meso scale or things like that. I think this is the big game changer and I think with this I mean we're we're at the sort of very very beginning of being able to pull all this off but there's now reliable differentiable frameworks in various spaces. Right there's JAX-MD which can do differentiable molecular dynamics, there's JAX-CFD which can do differentiable CFD, there's now startings of a differentiable DFT with Mohammed Qasim's work. So if you can chain all of these things together basically you know it's a slam dunk in terms of how you take how you can connect the scales and how you can bridge the scales. I mean we have we have decades of work left for any of these things to like sort of fully get production scale but I think that is the key enabler. I think that's I'm very very optimistic. I mean this will I think this will change the game.",
