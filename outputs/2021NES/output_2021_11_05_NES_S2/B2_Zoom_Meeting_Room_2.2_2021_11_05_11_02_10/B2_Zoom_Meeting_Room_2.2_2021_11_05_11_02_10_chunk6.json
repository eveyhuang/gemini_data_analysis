            "transcript": "and and you know so you could think about sort of trying to take this process which is already established and integrating it in a way that you know gets at the problem of CO2 capture and the problem of scale so if you could locate such as project in a region where there's you know you know close to the coast and there's abundant sea water and insulation is really high in principle you could you could work out something maybe even put together like a demo plant in a way that's that might be logistically easier to do than you know what like uh climb works I think they just announced that they they did their first they have a sort of their first demo plant up up and running so I think might be interesting to think about solutions like that which incorporate scale and industries that you know already exist like you know 35 million tons in terms of the the chloral industry so leveraging those for air capture.",

            "transcript": "So David I have two follow up comments to that my my thoughts in this space are that if you have to go from CO2 to product and if there is money to be made in that space you're going to get a lot of investors interested particularly if you can add on some 45Q credits to that so in many ways if there is the right market environment and the right policy environment and if you come up with innovation innovative chemistries and processes to do that the CO2 conversion problem might actually be handled by the market quite effectively the question then becomes a CO2 storage market which is you know who's going to store because then we're always thinking about the product that we want to produce to offset that cost right and typically with CO2 storage the product has been more hydrocarbons which is probably not the best thing if you're interested in putting the carbon back into the ground so then the question becomes who's going to take ownership of that CO2 that's stored and so for that reason in addition to geologic carbon storage there's a lot of interest in exploring aspects like mineralization right where you know if you can take that CO2 and in an accelerated manner convert that into a relatively solid carbonate you have the option of storing it you have the option of reusing it and then the question becomes what innovative chemistries can we come up with to reduce that cost down further and further till they become competitive because if you do that then there is a market that can be realized because there is you can store it but then you can still use the stored CO2 again the question is market size right we'll end up producing so much carbonate that there will be no value for carbonate.",

            "transcript": "Yeah I mean this gets at the sort of the discussion I think that that was had in the very beginning of this sort of conference in terms of you know do we emphasize or really push uh you know thinking about market incentives and you know mechanisms for getting you know industry involved or interested or do you hope that you know policy there's going to be policy incentives to to capture carbon and even if the market doesn't exist and I suppose you know one could if there are ways to look at you know use these products of accelerated weathering in some sort of industry then that sweetens the deal for both for both parties but anyway I just sort of throwing that out there as a potential path forward the specifics are really going to matter as usual.",

            "transcript": "I would also add to it one of the ones I've been interested in for a while now is waste to energy uh or waste to uh chemicals or anything and that's another distributed resource that we're just accumulating which has a large carbon chain and most of the world ends up incinerating that uh and obviously incineration there that's another point source that we could capture um and I would actually just to connect this back to something I said at the beginning was as question kind of direct air versus point source and I think I ruffled some feathers by kind of questioning the need for not the need for direct air but the magnitude um and I think what I what I wanted to get at was not that we don't need it because it's it's a clear need it was more so um are there ways of taking sources that are traditionally dilute and concentrating them to make intentionally make a point source um and this might be controversial I don't know but saying instead of landfilling waste we actually purposefully incinerate it to drive it down to carbonates or instead of I mean similar to bex um taking intentionally growing biomass to drive to a sequestered source later on and that was just in the spirit of I guess um what the topic for this session was was beyond direct air so I was just kind of curious about the thoughts there.",
