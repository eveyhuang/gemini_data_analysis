            "transcript": "So I can correct me if I'm wrong here, but my understanding here is that the we do need in addition to point source capture, we will need some air capture because we need to deal with historical emissions. So one way or the other that has to that has to happen. The way I think about point source versus direct air capture in terms of the trade-off is with point source, it's great that the concentrations are really high. That helps you energetically. But you want to capture as close to 100% of the as much of the CO2 coming from a point source as possible. And so the rate of capture has to be matched to the rate at which the CO2 is being produced to some extent. So even though you have a higher concentration, there's still a sort of you're still constrained in the sense that you have to capture you still have to impose a really high rate of capture. That also carries energetic penalties. Whereas with air capture, the concentration is a bit lower, but you might imagine there you're sort of in terms of the amount you need to capture, you know, atmosphere is just sort of 400 ppm, so you sort of have a constant PCO2 source. And you can think about people are thinking about all kinds of designs. You could have something like a sort of a tree-like design that just sort of sits there. It's not very energy intensive in terms of the amount of air, you know, the energy you need to spend in terms of contacting your sorbent with with air. And it could just sort of passively collect CO2. Of course, you want to do it at a really high rate and at a sufficiently high rate that it makes sense from a system level perspective. But you know, even though air capture you're doing it from a low concentration source, there is some flexibility in terms of how much you need to capture over a given period of time. And in terms of durability, my understanding with some of the point source work is amines, for example, which are common for point source capture, do degrade over time because you're dealing with, you know, fairly high temperatures in the from exhaust of fossil plant exhaust and so on. So anyway, that's just a sort of a thought when you sort of Yeah, go ahead.",

            "transcript": "So with that with the point sources, like yeah, my understanding is the amines and as you said, limited stability and potentially corrosive. And then my understanding is that the the release of the CO2 after it's captured, because you know, to like recycle the the sorbent, that's what's really energy intense and you know, can consume, I think it's like roughly, you know, the estimate's like 30% of the energy produced is used in just releasing the CO2 from the sorbent and so it's not very economical right now.",

            "transcript": "So David had a nice summary and Caroline's correct about the degradation of amines. So all good comments. One topic that I'll throw out there for you all to think about that I haven't heard anybody discuss in this context is if we imagine deploying direct air capture on a large scale, regardless of what approach we use, whether we use liquids or solids, inorganic structures, organic structures, probably they're going to create some emissions themselves. Maybe they're going to be VOCs, maybe they're going to be particulates. But I to my knowledge, nobody has really considered that as a research topic or a research area. And nobody has looked at how emissions associated with these chemical plants, which effectively is what they are, how that's going to intersect with current atmospheric chemistry from a from a traditional pollution perspective as opposed to a obviously it's it's removing CO2 pollution, but it might be introducing new types of pollution that I don't think anybody has thought about. So I'll just throw that out there as something you all can think about for potential proposal ideas. It has been studied pretty well for point source capture. So amine-based systems and point source capture, they make some pretty nasty off products like nitrosamines. So I don't know if that will extend to DAC systems for example, where the exposure to the environment is many many fold higher.",

            "transcript": "I think what kind of overwhelms me is the scale of things, especially, you know, the point source capture of CO2. So I had the opportunity to visit, you know, the the power plant in Alabama where they have the, you know, NETL has this pilot plant, you know, you can go there and try out your capture technology. I I saw how big those absorption desorption columns were and you have to like you know, I just couldn't comprehend how big this has to be for like even a 500 megawatt power plant. So when you think about the scale of things, I I think, you know, what Chris mentioned, you know, whatever you're bringing in needs to be benign or, you know, needs to have some green aspects to it. Um, so I think when I think about the whole system, so you have to remove, you know, NOx and SOx and and then and then by the time it's it's the CO2, you still have these impurities. So the one question in our queue for our group is, you know, integration, like electrochemical CO2 reduction. So when I think about those things that also needs to be added on on top of, you know, the captured CO2, it just keeps adding up and I don't know the next question that follows is, you know, what are the metrics for contrasting different capture technologies? Um, do we have to take into account all of these other things apart from just our capture technology itself, but all of the other things and at the end of the day, is that really, you know, like meaningful solution or not? Um, that's something that I'm kind of trying to open my eyes to. For the most part, I have been, you know, working with, okay, this material, I need to improve its performance. But you know, electrochemical CO2 reduction has been researched for the last, I don't know, 160 years and it's not it's not at the point where we can still deploy it, right? So anyway, maybe I'll just stop there and have I see Martha's hand up.",
