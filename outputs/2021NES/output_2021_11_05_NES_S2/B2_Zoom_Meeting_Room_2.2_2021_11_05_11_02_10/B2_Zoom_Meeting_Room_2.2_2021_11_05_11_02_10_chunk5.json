Right if your goal is to sequester the CO2 then you have to be at the right geographical location. I guess there are a whole host of more political issues there like who is going to have the liability if you're going to sequester it for the next 100 years. I think my thought is that there are so many variables when you think about that technology right the temperatures the humidity but also what you are doing with CO2. I think that's why it's so important to make use of CO2 in some ways and we always talk about electrochemical or some other means of reducing CO2 to something else. Something that I haven't really thought a lot about is there's also interest in ammonia synthesis. Could these things be coupled like can we maybe think a little bit outside of the box and not just focus on converting carbon dioxide to like methane or syngas but can we also add nitrogen to it and maybe make some other products. That might require some work on the catalyst but",

So it's a CO2 neutral but not negative fertilizer.",

            "timestamp": "04:24-06:25",
            "transcript": "Yes I can comment a little bit about that. So in the context of CO2 storage I would think that's something that would involve a government type entity or some public entity who takes responsibility for some level of public safety I would think and that's the reason why it's a little challenging for players to get into it because it's not a clean problem and it's not a problem that has profit attached to it. So it's basically a public good problem right when it comes to CO2 storage. But that is also one way to think about this is in the context of who takes responsibility for it. So right now when we look at all the fossil fuel divestments that are happening across all the universities it seems like people are pointing their fingers to fossil fuel companies and saying you have to take the responsibility for emitting CO2 but really they're just selling the commodity and we're consuming it every time we turn on our lights. So who takes the end responsibility for that I think that's a much more complex question. I think in terms of realizing this in a commercial scale some of the oil and gas companies are already starting to do this right. So for example Statoil has had more than 10 years of experience trying to store CO2 in the subsurface environments so a lot of oil and gas companies they have the reservoir engineering expertise to figure out how and where to put CO2 in the subsurface environments. From their perspective it's a solved problem because they know the geology and where CO2 can be injected safely and reliably. Their challenge I think is much more along the lines of who's going to pay for it because now the price of gas or the price of X hydrocarbon that they're going to sell into the market is going to increase substantially. So the question is really who you ask. Some people will say that geologic carbon storage is a solved problem some people will say that it's an uncharted territory. It's a question of who you're talking to.",

            "transcript": "I can comment on that. I was just going to comment on that and maybe share some results from a recent paper that we've published. So I'm a systems modeler and we were looking at carbon capture and storage projects globally but what we had data for were the 34 in the US that were projected to happen said they were going to happen but then they didn't happen. And so most of the storage or use of carbon that happens now and has been happening since the 70s is enhanced oil recovery to help produce oil from oil wells. And one of the problems as Greeshma was alluding to is what else can you do with it. So the carbon there has been carbon capture at some point sources the most successful is at coal-fired power plants but still not everyone is doing it and the question is why. If the technology is there why aren't we doing it. And one of the sad cases was the Petra Nova plant in Texas. They had been capturing carbon at the source but just this February they stopped doing it because the price of oil was too low. So they have all the technology in place and it's just sitting there. And one of the things that we found was that you need a credible revenue stream for your CO2. It can't just be sequestering it. You need the company to make some kind of money off of it. So what kind of products can we make with this I think is a really interesting question.",

            "transcript": "Well the revenue stream could be tax credits for sequestering right. So that's a model. 45Q gives $50 a ton for that. That's probably not enough for a lot of projects. That's a federal tax code in the US. And then the California low carbon fuel standard now also gives credits for demonstrated capture and sequestration and those credits trade between 100 and 200 a ton. So again if we're going to address it from a climate perspective that has to be the solution where there's a regional or global agreement on cost of carbon and there's the public good the governments that are providing revenue for that. But we're not going to make any value added products and get ourselves out of the climate change problem just because of scale. I'll give you a simple back of the envelope calculation. We know how much polyethylene we make today. If we could magically snap our fingers and make all the polyethylene out of CO2 we would consume 1% of our CO2 emissions. So it's just not",
