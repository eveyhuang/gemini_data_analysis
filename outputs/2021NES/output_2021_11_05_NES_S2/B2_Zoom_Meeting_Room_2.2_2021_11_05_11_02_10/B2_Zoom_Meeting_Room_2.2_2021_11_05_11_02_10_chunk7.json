So whether we end up with a a carbon society a nitrogen ammonia I mean the just based on how we use the energy as electricity instead of the need to store it in carbon I think yes the there will be a shift one way or another here hopefully.",

            "transcript": "Okay great. So here's what I had written up if you can see the share screen. So the key opportunities are that the DAC it can actually be deployed independently from point source emissions and with continued use of fossil fuels particularly from sources that are very challenging to capture from we will need to have DAC technologies implemented there's no doubt about it. But there are several challenges and really embedded opportunities that were presented and one of them is the fact that the variability of the compositions is quite high and the scale of the problem is significant and what this implies is that we need to have multiple solutions that need to be developed and encouraged from the standpoint of carbon removal and carbon capture. The second point that was raised was really more of a question which was how do we actually normalize durability for different technologies accounting for variability in compositions and we don't quite have an answer for that yet and so that's something that we need to continue putting resources into to work on. The third point was about the need to integrate molecular scale interactions with process scale engineering is particularly if you're looking to develop new materials thinking about realistic environments and where we can successfully deploy an emerging technology is really important in that context. The impact of varied operational conditions can actually unlock fresh ideas and innovation I would say in DAC as well as in industrial decarbonization so I'll need to add the industrial decarbonization piece. And again feel free to interrupt me at any moment to make sure that I'm capturing all of the ideas that we discussed carefully. So the end fate of CO2 impacts where DAC needs to be implemented. We also talked about we talked less about alternative regeneration approaches for direct air capture or CO2 capture I don't know if you want to make that a part of our agenda item I'm happy to leave it out but that was something that I thought would be nice to put in. We also talked about how converting CO2 to products is insufficient from the climate perspective and that CO2 storage is imperative. Then the question becomes it's not just contributions from fossil fuel usage we also need to think about industrial decarbonization and in that context there are products that are being brought to the market that are increasingly defossilized. So for example ammonia cement and construction materials could well be defossilized over the course of the next decade or so and in such an environment what would be the role of DAC and CO2 capture? So those are some of the key points and are there any additional points that you would like me to add edit remove?",
