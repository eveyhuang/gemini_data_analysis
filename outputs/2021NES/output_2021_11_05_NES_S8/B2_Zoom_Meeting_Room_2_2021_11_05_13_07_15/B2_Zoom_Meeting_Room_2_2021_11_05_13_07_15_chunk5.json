            "transcript": "Yeah I guess I somehow related to what has been discussed but something that has been also in the back of my mind for for some time which is the life cycle and the composition mechanisms right? So let's say that we make this dream catalyst and it's earth abundant but then it dies after a few cycles right and it's selective and it's but then I guess the we we don't know at least as far I know the the decomposition mechanism that many things have right? And that will help us to understand if we reach that dream material dream catalyst or dream interface and we try to stop the way it decomposes right? Because let's say that's what it's trying to be what is happening probably in the battery fields or any other big application subfield where you you have something but you want to extend the lifetime and you realize that if you have something that lasts let's say 10 years or 50 years doesn't matter that it's the most expensive things because it will recover over time all that investment that you did. And on that on this direction I was thinking if if we do that on these electrochemistry or these interfaces what could be the ways to characterize the composition mechanisms right? So what Emily was saying earlier is that well you you you can also get the dynamics the the the the solvent but also there is a lot of things happening let's say in the electrode interface right? You have an electric field there and there is a lot of things happening in between at the theoretical level you know you have to do different approximations let's say a grand canonical Monte Carlo or something to change the number of particles on that interface and even you have to have that polarization. So from the theoretical point of view you you you know it's a it's a problem that that it's there that is related to the composition but from the experimental point of view something that that you were discussing with how you measure those things that are happening there. So I wonder if if if people look at the composition from the experimental point of view how would you check those things right? So how would you still do RDF would you have to change the mechanism do you have to do a probe and yeah it was some sort of open question related to summary what you were discussing but also something that I have been thinking about for you know if we can get something that it lasts a very long time probably that could also be a way to to go even though it might be more expensive.

            "transcript": "I like I like in general the idea of alternative oxidative chemistries. So just pairing CO2 reduction with something that's other than water oxidation. The issues with selecting what you want to oxidize in this case methane has a lot of boundary conditions. So one would would say if you talk to an energy company and you say you want to do valorization of methane they take that as a signal to say well we can keep our methane infrastructure alive longer. And there's pros and cons to that so it's kind of it can enable one thing while addressing another. But it it comes into I think the systems integration which is super interesting because it's not just you know optimize CO2 reduction optimize methane oxidation put them together. There's there's integration issues of products or intermediates of one can cross over and oxidize or reduce at the other end making the system not stable. So I think in in looking at a different chemistry to pair with CO2 reduction on the anode side it's not just the efficiency or selectivity of that reaction but how the integration would work. You know if one works in a very alkaline system very very well and the other one prefers an acidic medium then you need good membrane selectivity or good electrolyte that reduces crossover. So I really like the idea of of a different oxidative chemistry but the pairing of it I think is is the key question rather than just the the efficiency of that one reaction.",

            "transcript": "People have been working on CH activation for decades since I was an undergraduate. Certainly probably even before that but when I was an undergraduate at Berkeley there was a big group I was in discovered this iridium catalyst that bit into the CH bond for the first time Bob Bergman's group and but it's it's just not not trivial at all. And you know I think I mean there's some really interesting things that unfortunately the things that I that I think are in some in some ways most interesting we have to figure out if we can use either waste heat or at least renewable electricity to use them. I mean and so I don't really see electrochemistry as the route to doing to taking care of methane. I hope I'm wrong but there are really interesting ways of using plasmas to to essentially take methane to hydrogen and carbon. So that I think is an interesting route as well as actually some high temperature routes involving metal chlorides that can take methane to hydrogen chloride which then can be you can recycle into hydrogen essentially and carbon. So I think there are other ways to do it but again that involves another set of another reactor that you're going to couple to. So I'm just looking at these questions we we have a like five more minutes where I think until we should try to synthesize look at what Jimmy's notes have to say and see whether we can extract the agree on on the extraction of what he he should say to the larger group but so I just want to go through these questions again. How can we take advantage of the increasing competitiveness of clean sources of electricity to valorize greenhouse gases? So to me the answer for that is of course you know first of all every amount of clean source of electricity should be used as electricity first and foremost because every other use of it for electrolysis or something else is not going to be 100% efficient so it wouldn't be the best use of it but in the case that you have excess wind or excess solar you know midday in California nighttime in in the Midwest for wind I think we should be thinking about having ways to have distributed electrolysis. I don't know I mean I don't know how practical it is but but essentially just making sure that we don't waste any electricity that we make because right now we are wasting it. Anyway I don't know if anybody has any comments on that but oh Jordi welcome.",

Okay and then we spent a lot of time talking about fundamental questions arising from the transition from laboratory to implementation and scale so I think we've we've pretty much addressed that. We talked about local chemical activity so we addressed that issue. And I think Shu brought up the issue of coupling oxidative and reductive possibilities so we addressed that a little bit more. But there's you know the whole issue I suppose of of what should the oxidative side be that's come up before. And I don't know do you have any does anyone have anything else they want to add?
