      "transcript": "kind of the length scale can give you a different reactive transport mechanism than the electrocatalyst. The point is for example the CO2 reaction CO2 equilibrium is actually pretty slow. So you can have the CO2 transient reacting in the pH 9 or pH 8 solutions on the order of minutes to be able to convert that to bicarbonates and vice versa. And how does that actually play a role across multiple scales in the electrolysis process or in a photocatalysis process. So that's something that we actually don't quite know that we recently find out. And then what the model can do is actually kinetics but how does the kinetics is the kinetics right across multiple scales? How does the kinetics works out near the near the catalyst at a nano scale. So those are the things actually probably require more of the characterizations and actually to close the loop. So yeah that's the thing thinking about.",

      "transcript": "Yeah so I think we're covering a quite a lot of topics across many different length scales and I feel like some thread between a lot of different comments have been like kind of how do we understand mechanisms how do we design experiments how do we translate you know a bulk electrolysis measurement for a material property to a cell. And that's something that we think a lot about in terms of I come from a battery field where batteries are extremely mature and so the question about reality is is very much kind of always on the tip of what we're studying. And I think that this field of CO2 electrolysis has a lot to learn from fuel cells and just like in the past in terms of there's been quite a lot of work on how you test something on a rotating disc electrode and how you make an ink and how you formulate that composition and how that impacts reaction kinetics you know the morphology of your electrode. But just kind of an aside to this conversation in terms of characterizing interfaces and I think it was Linsey who was mentioning the importance of chemical micro environments and how do we probe these length scales that are in the nano scale. And of course we have the opportunity to go to the nano scale moving from optical techniques to x-ray techniques but really if you're going to get to the nano scale techniques you're limited to electrons really to probe those particular micro environments. But that's going to be an exceedingly hard challenge understanding the nano scale for these micro environments is I think just very very challenging to detect.",

      "transcript": "Hi. I wanted to bring in another comment about length scales and how local is local. And this is something I haven't really thought too deeply about but I wonder along similar lines. I know that there's a technique for crystallographic determination of disorder or order called PDF. So I don't know if anyone here is familiar with that but it's basically a way to use crystallography to map out potential disorders on not immediate length scales like bond scales and not long range for example like something you could get from x-ray diffraction patterns. But you can look at maybe like several nanometer length scales. So I'm curious if anyone is interested about using this PDF technique in order to look at electrode surfaces and maybe understand how under operating conditions the electrode may be restructuring and creating some medium range disorder.",
