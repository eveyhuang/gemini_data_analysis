So there's a number of different ways to measure local pH and folks have looked at cation impacts, proton impacts, kinetic isotope effects, but how local is local? So we're still really mostly if you're using these rotating disk electrode type formats, you're still measuring microns to millimeters away and we're really interested in that nanometer scale, right? So I think pushing experimental techniques to be able to probe those relevant length scales is kind of interesting. ",

And I think to me that's one of the biggest challenges because you know, we had this discussion last time, there's certain conditions that you want to characterize in and there's very different conditions you want to use them in. So, you know, finding ways, you know, probably for spectroscopy, you want more of a bulk electrolyte to get signal to make everything stable and good, but most likely in a large scale reactor, you don't want bulk liquids flowing around these things. So to me that that's one of these challenges is how to devise a cell to really probe this nanometer locality. And I also agree how local is local, we ask that question like every day. I mean, local is all relative, but focusing on the nanometer scale, designing a cell for characterization that can give you nanoscale information that also represents a large scale reactor, I think that's a super important thing to do and a challenge that we need to work on.

So if we look at, you know, some things we want to learn directly from water electrolysis and fuel cells. And in general, those electrochemical processes at scale typically don't ever have a bulk liquid electrolyte. They're all in the kind of membrane electrode assembly with humidified gas streams more or less. And the issue with translating that to CO2 reduction is that those systems have no problem with selectivity. They're unity selectivity either way. You're making hydrogen and oxygen out of water or the reverse process. Here for CO2 reduction, the sensitivity to selectivity is I think more paramount. And so in terms of reactor design, in general, we can see if you want to make a gaseous product, you probably want to have a membrane electrode assembly without a liquid. But if you want to make a liquid product, there's huge benefits to having a even a small flowing electrolyte which can use partial pressures and pull the liquid out. So this comes to, you know, separations, what are the steps we need to do afterwards? What what could be tolerant in the next step? You know, sometimes if we, you know, make formate and we have it in a bunch of electrolyte mixed in, well if we feed that to a biological process, that can withstand that. But if we send that to a thermochemical process, you need to do a separation step to to get that out. So, you know, the the the niceness that that field hasn't been explored yet is that there's so many options and that we don't really know. So I think that, you know, the reactor configuration at scale, we don't know what it will look like yet specifically for CO2 reduction chemistry. And there's some things that align with the water electrolyzers and some things that don't. So I think we need to learn from them but then also define design criteria for CO2 electrolyzers. ",

And so it brings up the issue of matching fluxes. And that's that is something that again, you know, we've had various discussions about complexity.

But the other thing that's relevant, you know, back to the kind of characterization question is the conditions that these things are run at. So for example, if we want a CO2 electrolyzer that makes syngas or CO, and we want to feed that to a Fischer-Tropsch synthesis plant which is operating at 50 bar, then the question is, do we need to operate the electrolysis at 50 bar so there's a direct connection?

So all all these diagrams that you know it's like the uh phase diagrams I I guess it's like the wave function of of of all these compounds. Um but if we go for CO2 or methane or any of the of the things that we would like to to um to transform, I guess there's so so we're usually on on the liquids or or but then there is an interactions, right? With with if we have some something um gas. So so I was thinking on on not only the phase diagrams of all these components on the on the condensed phase but also how that's in equilibrium with um something that is let's say in the gas phase, right? So um if you do a simple back of the envelope calculations you can you can estimate that um you know if um you change like 70 ppm of CO2 um in the atmosphere that would be a pH change on on seawater let's say of 0.05 and that's um that's about 10.6% of changes on concentration of protons. So um but then that's just CO2 and that's just you just need the vapor pressure of that CO2 and then you can get the um the amount of of of other components that you will have in the solution. So just going back to all these different components, I guess um it's it just keep me thinking about the the the um the phase diagrams of these things and also the vapor pressure and and how these phase diagrams changes on the liquid versus the gas and how they are interconnected if we were to to do some um some gradients for that going to the to the basic um point that was uh brought forward by Linsey.

But thinking about industrial application would people really be interested or at least the investors really be interested in using acetonitrile or DMF right? So cost wise it's really not attractive. Other other uh parameters like for basic research we we use um we use H cell typically for electrolysis right? But for industrial electrolysis it is probably more uh attractive to use a flow cell.

The reason you go to synchrotron is time scale, that temporal scale and as synchrotrons get upgraded to femto, free electron lasers, that's going to be the benefit. But a lot of techniques that introduce coherence, like coherent diffraction imaging breaks the laws of wavelength and so your resolution is governed by the wavelength. And so coherent diffraction imaging is I think even it's the challenge with PDF and coherent diffraction imaging, these are both reciprocal space techniques. That means I need a model to interpret my data. And so that really opens the scale in as someone who does a lot of reciprocal and real space imaging, it is super dependent on having good models, good data analysis and you know which is going to be coupling machine learning, artificial intelligence.

So let's say that we make this dream catalyst and it's earth abundant but then it dies after a few cycles right and it's selective and it's but then I guess the we we don't know at least as far I know the the decomposition mechanism that many things have right? And that will help us to understand if we reach that dream material dream catalyst or dream interface and we try to stop the way it decomposes right? Because let's say that's what it's trying to be what is happening probably in the battery fields or any other big application subfield where you you have something but you want to extend the lifetime and you realize that if you have something that lasts let's say 10 years or 50 years doesn't matter that it's the most expensive things because it will recover over time all that investment that you did. And on that on this direction I was thinking if if we do that on these electrochemistry or these interfaces what could be the ways to characterize the composition mechanisms right? So what Emily was saying earlier is that well you you you can also get the dynamics the the the the solvent but also there is a lot of things happening let's say in the electrode interface right? You have an electric field there and there is a lot of things happening in between at the theoretical level you know you have to do different approximations let's say a grand canonical Monte Carlo or something to change the number of particles on that interface and even you have to have that polarization. So from the theoretical point of view you you you know it's a it's a problem that that it's there that is related to the composition but from the experimental point of view something that that you were discussing with how you measure those things that are happening there. So I wonder if if if people look at the composition from the experimental point of view how would you check those things right? So how would you still do RDF would you have to change the mechanism do you have to do a probe and yeah it was some sort of open question related to summary what you were discussing but also something that I have been thinking about for you know if we can get something that it lasts a very long time probably that could also be a way to to go even though it might be more expensive.

The issues with selecting what you want to oxidize in this case methane has a lot of boundary conditions. So one would would say if you talk to an energy company and you say you want to do valorization of methane they take that as a signal to say well we can keep our methane infrastructure alive longer. And there's pros and cons to that so it's kind of it can enable one thing while addressing another. But it it comes into I think the systems integration which is super interesting because it's not just you know optimize CO2 reduction optimize methane oxidation put them together. There's there's integration issues of products or intermediates of one can cross over and oxidize or reduce at the other end making the system not stable. So I think in in looking at a different chemistry to pair with CO2 reduction on the anode side it's not just the efficiency or selectivity of that reaction but how the integration would work. You know if one works in a very alkaline system very very well and the other one prefers an acidic medium then you need good membrane selectivity or good electrolyte that reduces crossover. So I really like the idea of of a different oxidative chemistry but the pairing of it I think is is the key question rather than just the the efficiency of that one reaction. ",

Certainly probably even before that but when I was an undergraduate at Berkeley there was a big group I was in discovered this iridium catalyst that bit into the CH bond for the first time Bob Bergman's group and but it's it's just not not trivial at all. And you know I think I mean there's some really interesting things that unfortunately the things that I that I think are in some in some ways most interesting we have to figure out if we can use either waste heat or at least renewable electricity to use them. I mean and so I don't really see electrochemistry as the route to doing to taking care of methane. I hope I'm wrong but there are really interesting ways of using plasmas to to essentially take methane to hydrogen and carbon. So that I think is an interesting route as well as actually some high temperature routes involving metal chlorides that can take methane to hydrogen chloride which then can be you can recycle into hydrogen essentially and carbon. So I think there are other ways to do it but again that involves another set of another reactor that you're going to couple to. So I'm just looking at these questions we we have a like five more minutes where I think until we should try to synthesize look at what Jimmy's notes have to say and see whether we can extract the agree on on the extraction of what he he should say to the larger group but so I just want to go through these questions again. How can we take advantage of the increasing competitiveness of clean sources of electricity to valorize greenhouse gases? So to me the answer for that is of course you know first of all every amount of clean source of electricity should be used as electricity first and foremost because every other use of it for electrolysis or something else is not going to be 100% efficient so it wouldn't be the best use of it but in the case that you have excess wind or excess solar you know midday in California nighttime in in the Midwest for wind I think we should be thinking about having ways to have distributed electrolysis. I don't know I mean I don't know how practical it is but but essentially just making sure that we don't waste any electricity that we make because right now we are wasting it.
