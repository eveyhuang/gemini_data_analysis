            "transcript": "kind of the land scale can give you a different reactive transport mechanism than the electrocatalyst. The point is for example, the CO2 reaction, CO2 equilibrium is actually pretty slow. So you can have the CO2 transient reacting in the pH 9 or pH 8 solutions on the order of minutes to be able to convert that to bicarbonates and vice versa. And how does that actually play a role across multiple scales in the electrolysis process or in a photocatalysis process. So that's something that we actually don't quite know, the reason we find out. And then what the model can do is actually kinetics but how does the kinetics, is the kinetics right across multiple scales? How does the kinetics works out near the near the catalyst at a nano scale. So those are the things actually probably require more of the characterizations and actually to close the loop. So that's the thing I'm thinking about.",

And that's something that we think a lot about in terms of I come from a battery field where batteries are extremely mature and so the question about reality is very much kind of always on the tip of what we're studying. And I think that this field of CO2 electrolysis has a lot to learn from fuel cells in just in the past in terms of there's been quite a lot of work on how you test something on a rotating disc electrode and how you make an ink and how you formulate that composition and how that impacts reaction kinetics, your the morphology of your electrode. But just kind of an aside to this conversation in terms of characterizing interfaces and I think it was Lindsey who was mentioning the importance of chemical micro environments and how do we probe these length scales that are in the nano scale. And of course we have the opportunity to go to the nano scale moving from optical techniques to x-ray techniques but really if you're going to get to the nano scale techniques you're really limited to electrons really to probe those particular micro environments. But that's going to be an exceedingly hard challenge. Understanding the nano scale for these micro environments is I think just very very challenging to detect.",

And this is something I haven't really thought too deeply about but I wonder along similar lines. I know that there's a technique for crystallographic determination of disorder or order called PDF. So I don't know if anyone here is familiar with that but it's basically a way to use crystallography to map out potential disorders on not immediate length scales like bond scales and not long range for example like something you could get from x-ray diffraction patterns but you can look at maybe several nanometer length scales. So I'm curious if anyone is interested about using this PDF technique in order to look at electrode surfaces and maybe understand how under operating conditions the electrode may be restructuring and creating some medium range disorder.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, pair so PDF is great for basically amorphous materials. So it really can capture heterogeneity in materials. From my understanding it's very very good for heterogeneous materials. And so synchrotrons are great. The reason you go to synchrotron is time scale, that temporal scale and as synchrotrons get upgraded to femto, free electron lasers, that's going to be the benefit. But a lot of techniques that introduce coherence, like coherent diffraction imaging breaks the laws of wavelength and so your resolution is governed by the wavelength. And so coherent diffraction imaging is I think even it's the challenge with PDF and coherent diffraction imaging, these are both reciprocal space techniques. That means I need a model to interpret my data. And so that really opens the scale in as someone who does a lot of reciprocal and real space imaging, it is super dependent on having good models, good data analysis and you know which is going to be coupling machine learning, artificial intelligence. But yeah it's like any experiment if you're dependent on a model, that's a whole another body of work that has to be done to interpret that data set. But I like the idea of PDF though. It's a very powerful technique.",

My suggestion is maybe we also need to look at the time resolved PDF because these things are moving, labile. So if we couldn't do that you are going to see average effect which actually wash out all the features. So I wonder if anyone knows that the people actually have looked into that maybe at SLAC and I don't know. So that's an interesting technique to think about.

But then I actually wanted to flip it on its head. Do we actually have an opportunity to make more interesting products if you co-feed CO2 and oxygen? Do we get more oxygenates that we're not seeing as much right now? What if we specifically co-evolved peroxide and CO2 reduction products and then to specifically use that peroxide you could throw in some molecular facilitated catalyst because we do some molecular facilitated like a tungsten peroxyacetate, right? So you could do a selective oxidation of a CO2 reduction product. A little out there with mechanism, but is that a way to get ethylene carbonate which we're going to need at huge scales for lithium ion batteries or do we have some more tunability for complex mechanisms that might be fun?",
