And so being explicitly aware of what those compromises are is almost a study within itself.

Um but if we go for CO2 or methane or any of the of the things that we would like to to um to transform I guess there's so so we're usually on on the liquids or or but then there is an interactions right with with if we have some something um gas so so I was thinking on on not only the phase diagrams of all these components on the on the condensed phase but also how that's in equilibrium with um something that is let's say in the gas phase right so um if you do a simple back of the envelope calculations you can you can estimate that um you know if um you change like 70 ppm of CO2 um in the atmosphere that would be a pH change on on on sea water let's say of 0.05 and that's um that's about 10.6% of changes on concentration of protons so um but then that's just CO2 and that's just you just need the vapor pressure of that CO2 and then you can get the um the amount of of of other components that you will have in the solution. So just going back to all these different components I guess um it's it just keep me thinking about the the the um the phase diagrams of these things and also the vapor pressure and and how these phase diagrams changes on the liquid versus the gas and how they are interconnected if we were to to do some um some gradients for that right going to the to the basic um point that was uh brought forward by Linsey but yeah that's one of my thoughts that I don't know it's just uh",

Um but also just thinking more like broadly you know like we do stuff in acetonitrile but what solvent should be we really be working in does it really matter you know for scaling up um or if we just don't even want solvent or water and how all that impacts um thinking about the the local chemical activity at electrodes specifically and yeah I just I don't have any like good concrete idea I just was kind of all over the place with this prompt I don't know why.",

      "transcript": "Hi I have a a guess a different question to change the topic a little bit. Um I'm wondering if there's any role that electrochemistry can play in terms of um allowing us to do CO2 conversion from an impure CO2 stream or CO2 containing stream because I think one thing that you know my lab does and I think pretty much all labs do is we take our CO2 tank and turn it on and bubble in 5.0 UHP CO2 right and that's not necessarily going to be relevant or useful in terms of real life conversion. So uh yeah I just wanted to sort of throw that as an open question here if that's something that's interesting and worth pursuing and and using electrochemistry as like I don't know or or electrode interfaces as a sieve to sort of sort out the CO2 and do something with that and exclude oxygen from air perhaps.",

Um you know in in real life there's going to be competition for absorption and then and then reaction and how do you control the competition for absorption are there ways to do that both with the electrode material and and the and the conditions that you run the electrolysis and and the choice of electrolyte and membranes. So all of these are open open issues. Um Jimmy I know you're taking notes
