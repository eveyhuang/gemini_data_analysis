So I'll just start really quickly and just say I'm Emily Carter, I'm the Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost at UCLA and I work on a variety of of sustainable energy technologies including carbon dioxide reduction which is what we're here to discuss today. So it's not actually I shouldn't say that it shouldn't be limited right to just carbon dioxide. It's also methane and other possible greenhouse gases. So with that, can I ask Caroline for you to introduce yourself and just say which department you're in at Utah and your and your interests?",

And then moreover thinking how do we interface you know like captured CO2 with CO2 catalysis since we always just use you know a clean stream of CO2 gas when we do catalysis.

So these are the reactions that under solar photochemistry and we initially work on the solar hydrogen production but now we are extending the reaction systems to methane oxidation and other carbon-carbon coupling processes and also recently working on the photoredox organic synthesis but on photocatalyst surfaces. So what we're aspired to is actually the the practical side of photocatalysis, heterogeneous catalysis where you can ease the reactor design but also drive chemistry at room temperature by using light and other means. So the relevance to this is actually we also work on electrocatalysis but actually in the context of comparing the electron transfer processes for photo versus electro.
