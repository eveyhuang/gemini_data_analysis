And so being explicitly aware of what those compromises are is almost a study within itself.

Maybe um maybe following up on the discussion that uh Linsey I think last year we also had some discussion about the the locality of things and and and I guess the gradient was one of the topics and and to quantify it and now that I was hearing you guys discussing this in in more detail and of course this is your expertise but I was thinking on um diagrams, right? So all all these diagrams that you know it's like the uh phase diagrams I I guess it's like the wave function of of of all these compounds. Um but if we go for CO2 or methane or any of the of the things that we would like to to um to transform, I guess there's so so we're usually on on the liquids or or but then there is an interactions, right? With with if we have some something um gas. So so I was thinking on on not only the phase diagrams of all these components on the on the condensed phase but also how that's in equilibrium with um something that is let's say in the gas phase, right? So um if you do a simple back of the envelope calculations you can you can estimate that um you know if um you change like 70 ppm of CO2 um in the atmosphere that would be a pH change on on seawater let's say of 0.05 and that's um that's about 10.6% of changes on concentration of protons. So um but then that's just CO2 and that's just you just need the vapor pressure of that CO2 and then you can get the um the amount of of of other components that you will have in the solution. So just going back to all these different components, I guess um it's it just keep me thinking about the the the um the phase diagrams of these things and also the vapor pressure and and how these phase diagrams changes on the liquid versus the gas and how they are interconnected if we were to to do some um some gradients for that going to the to the basic um point that was uh brought forward by Linsey. But yeah, that's one of my thoughts that I don't know it's just uh",

I'd say is just um is like what we do in just a little CV experiment and you know our little bulk electrolysis cells is that really um reflective of of a larger scale system. Um but also just thinking more like broadly, you know like we do stuff in acetonitrile but what solvent should be we really be working in? Does it really matter you know for scaling up um or if we just don't even want solvent or water and how all that impacts um thinking about the the local chemical activity at electrodes specifically and yeah I just I don't have any like good concrete idea I just was kind of all over the place with this prompt I don't know why.",

Um I'm wondering if there's any role that electrochemistry can play in terms of um allowing us to do CO2 conversion from an impure CO2 stream or CO2 containing stream because I think one thing that you know my lab does and I think pretty much all labs do uh is we take our CO2 tank and turn it on and bubble in 5.0 UHP CO2, right? Um and that's not necessarily going to be relevant or useful in terms of real life conversion. So uh yeah I just wanted to sort of throw that as an open question here if that's something that's interesting and worth pursuing and and using electrochemistry as like I don't know or or electrode interfaces as a sieve to sort of sort out the CO2 and do something with that and exclude oxygen from air perhaps.",

Um you know in in real life there's going to be competition for absorption and then and then reaction and how do you control the competition for absorption? Are there ways to do that both with the electrode material and and the and the conditions that you run the electrolysis and the and the choice of electrolyte and membranes.

So as mentioned several times we should really bear that in mind when we do fundamental research. And every time when at least for my lab we we we do a lot of homogeneous catalysis we use organic solvents like acetonitrile or DMF right? But thinking about industrial application would people really be interested or at least the investors really be interested in using acetonitrile or DMF right? So cost wise it's really not attractive. Other other uh parameters like for basic research we we use um we use H cell typically for electrolysis right? But for industrial electrolysis it is probably more uh attractive to use a flow cell. So would it be possible that for fundamental researchers we can also think about using you know the the smaller scale flow cell. So even though the parameters for a smaller flow cell could be quite different from a bigger flow cell but at least the difference is smaller than uh H cell and and a flow cell. So that's that's a point I would like to make.",

And I was thinking about we have a um a nice combination of theorists and experimentalists here and also fundamental people science and engineers. And um the scale actually come out a lot of times actually how to how does current models bridge couple of scales from microscopic scale all the way down to molecular scale during catalysis and that's one. And also Emily you mentioned about the dynamics so how does the model actually handle the time scale from from various points. Um so one of the things that we've been studying is recently studying is how um so in a in a photocatalysis you actually can have the localized redox reactions. You can one type of size doing reduction and the other side can kind of doing oxidation and actually that can",
