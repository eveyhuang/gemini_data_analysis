      "transcript": "selective water oxidation to hydrogen peroxide and then the hydrogen peroxide can work with other things and you can generate some other oxygenates or other products. And and also we talk about CH activation but methane CH activation is the hardest one. So but but I'm sure there are like millions other compounds that are easier than methane activation and and and if we think about a very fine niche markets and making fine chemicals or even for example drug discovery and how do you actually couple those electron-driven organic synthesis with the CO2 reduction and to make chemicals and that I think that would be something to think about too.",

Is there something we could play around with with NOx and ammonia natural I think equilibria that then exist in water and then if you coupled something like that with an urban areas right the concentrations of like NO and NO2 are approximately also 400 ppm so you could almost even have a one-to-one ratio if you're doing air capture of NOx species and CO2. I don't have a particular direction just throwing some interesting thing I was trying to jumble around in my head.",
