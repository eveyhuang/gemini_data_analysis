And so thinking about that local environment actually is something I've been quite interested in lately. So measuring and really quantifying the interaction relationship between bulk reactor scale conditions and local conditions, but then also really quantifying what local means for each experiment. So there's a number of different ways to measure local pH and folks have looked at cation impacts, proton impacts, kinetic isotope effects, but how local is local? So we're still really mostly if you're using these rotating disk electrode type formats, you're still measuring microns to millimeters away and we're really interested in that nanometer scale, right? So I think pushing experimental techniques to be able to probe those relevant length scales is kind of interesting.",

And I think to me that's one of the biggest challenges because you know, we had this discussion last time, there's certain conditions that you want to characterize in and there's very different conditions you want to use them in. So, you know, finding ways, you know, probably for spectroscopy, you want more of a bulk electrolyte to get signal to make everything stable and good, but most likely in a large scale reactor, you don't want bulk liquids flowing around these things. So to me that that's one of these challenges is how to devise a cell to really probe this nanometer locality. And I also agree how local is local, we ask that question like every day. I mean, local is all relative, but focusing on the nanometer scale, designing a cell for characterization that can give you nanoscale information that also represents a large scale reactor, I think that's a super important thing to do and a challenge that we need to work on.",

If you if you look at conventional commercial electrolyzers, are there different designs that are used in terms of, you know, whether or not they're yeah, I mean different obviously there are different reactor designs, right? And the question is, does that what does that depend on? Does it depend on Anyway, maybe Wilson, do you know something about this you could share with with us?",

            "timestamp": "7:07-8:43",
            "transcript": "Yeah, it's a really good question that opens up a Pandora's box. So if we look at, you know, some things we want to learn directly from water electrolysis and fuel cells. And in general, those electrochemical processes at scale typically don't ever have a bulk liquid electrolyte. They're all in the kind of membrane electrode assembly with humidified gas streams more or less. And the issue with translating that to CO2 reduction is that those systems have no problem with selectivity. They're unity selectivity either way. You're making hydrogen and oxygen out of water or the reverse process. Here for CO2 reduction, the sensitivity to selectivity is I think more paramount. And so in terms of reactor design, in general, we can see if you want to make a gaseous product, you probably want to have a membrane electrode assembly without a liquid. But if you want to make a liquid product, there's huge benefits to having a even a small flowing electrolyte which can use partial pressures and pull the liquid out. So this comes to, you know, separations, what are the steps we need to do afterwards? What what could be tolerant in the next step? You know, sometimes if we, you know, make formate and we have it in a bunch of electrolyte mixed in, well if we feed that to a biological process, that can withstand that. But if we send that to a thermochemical process, you need to do a separation step to to get that out. So, you know, the the the niceness that that field hasn't been explored yet is that there's so many options and that we don't really know. So I think that, you know, the reactor configuration at scale, we don't know what it will look like yet specifically for CO2 reduction chemistry. And there's some things that align with the water electrolyzers and some things that don't. So I think we need to learn from them but then also define design criteria for CO2 electrolyzers.",

The other thing what you said got me thinking about is when you think about feeding the outcome of an of an electrolyzer, electrocatalyst, whatever, to a biological system that, you know, of course depending on the biological system, it could be faster, it could be slower. And so it brings up the issue of matching fluxes. And that's that is something that again, you know, we've had various discussions about complexity. This is another level of complexity is if you if you have multiple units that that have to to work together, how to match those fluxes in an optimal way.",

The back end, do you need, you know, vats that that concentrate things and let it go. But the other thing that's relevant, you know, back to the kind of characterization question is the conditions that these things are run at. So for example, if we want a CO2 electrolyzer that makes syngas or CO, and we want to feed that to a Fischer-Tropsch synthesis plant which is operating at 50 bar, then the question is, do we need to operate the electrolysis at 50 bar so there's a direct connection?
