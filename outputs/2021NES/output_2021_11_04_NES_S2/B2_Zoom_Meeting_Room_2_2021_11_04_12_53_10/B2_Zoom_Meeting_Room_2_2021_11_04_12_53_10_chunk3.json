      "transcript": "So it sounds like if you if you can find a way to just, I mean it sounds like a very low tech Boris solution, but if you you can find a way of sourcing these rocks and just finding energy efficient ways of crushing them. Um, you know, in principle you you're not all the way there, but that that seems like something that could scale.",

      "timestamp": "00:32-01:11",
      "transcript": "Yeah, I mean, one of the practical challenges with enhanced weathering is that if you only do it for the purpose of uh CO2 sequestration, then it's a big cost, right? So if we want you to crush rock and spread it on the beach, then it's just a cost, we get nothing back. Uh, that's why again I try to focus on agricultural lands because if I can uh uh convince the farmers to use it uh because then by using these rocks, you can use less fertilizer, you save money, plants grow better, then there's more economic motivation for for it to uh to work. And it can work on farms, it might work on forest lands, might work on some some other scenarios. Uh in the ocean, the one of the challenges is just how do you where would the money come from to to to pay for it?",

      "transcript": "You and me. Um and what one of the things interesting about farmlands is that many farms many soils are uh calcium poor, particularly after they farm them. And so they actually need to add calcium and they today they add limestone or many other forms a rock that has calcium in it. And so, you know, what Raphael is suggesting is let's add a rock that, you know, has the maximum amount of CO2 uptake and then the plants get the calcium and everybody's happy.",

      "timestamp": "01:38-02:14",
      "transcript": "Um it's not there's sort of a similar relationship in the ocean. It's this instantaneous equilibrium in the ocean that's really interesting and that as soon as the calcium's there, it will calibrate, form calcium bicarbonate and you will effectively suck some CO2 out of the air. Of course, the CO2 is already in the ocean, you're just stabilizing it. But but you're you're reducing the acidification of the ocean by doing that. You're adding, you know, a base.",

      "transcript": "Can I can I ask a clarifi clarification question here? So for enhanced weathering maybe maybe a question for Raphael or Roger, if you put in the rocks, does that add dissolved inorganic carbon into the ocean water or it just does nothing to it? Or it depends?",

    {
      "speaker": "Rafael Santos (Guelph)",
      "timestamp": "02:36-03:13",
      "transcript": "So yeah, so if you if you put a alkaline rock into the ocean, it it the idea is that it will dissolve again it will dissolve relatively slowly because weathering rates are are a function of pH. But once it dissolves uh it it will dissolve more CO2 into the ocean or or it will take the excess CO2 which has been dissolving in the ocean and and speciate with that uh like Roger said the equilibrium is different. it's difficult to to understand it's very complex. Is it coming from the air? Is it is the CO2 that's already dissolved? It's it's it's it's hard to say. We have to do some actual tope analysis or something to try to prove the the origin of the CO2 but uh yeah, that's that's the general idea.",

    {
      "speaker": "Roger Aines LLNL",
      "timestamp": "03:14-04:04",
      "transcript": "But once it stabilizes that once the calcium and the the CO2 are speciated and stabilized, remember that that's now over the saturation limit. There's more uh there and so organisms will start using that to make their shells out of the shells sink to the bottom of the ocean, eventually forms limestone. This is the way that the earth manages the overall concentration of the CO2 in the atmosphere and ocean by that cycle. And so what you're doing is hopefully just speeding it up a little bit. And as as Nanette said, these animals are so eager for any of the nutrients that they need is if you make them available, everything stays in equilibrium, you have more growth, more more shells, more limestone forming on the bottom of the ocean.",

      "transcript": "So that's actually a question that I've been wondering for the past couple years on this project is how do we like model the mass transport between the air and the ocean. So like a lot of my motivation for doing ocean capture as well it's helping with ocean acidification, it could be a win win, but then, you know, you're kind of indirectly doing air capture, right? You're taking CO2 out of the air, it goes into the ocean, you pull it out and then air comes back in from the air to the ocean.",

      "timestamp": "04:46-05:07",
      "transcript": "And so my question is, okay, like how fast we need to be removing it from the ocean to kind of, you know, actually reverse the pH before it just, you know, re-equilibrates with the air above it. So I'm just throwing that out there like that's something that interests me, might be a fun proposal to work on with some people just, you know, figure out how to model this mass transport between the air and the ocean.",

So so we need to to to be able to model the geochemistry, so how the minerals are dissolving, how they're speciating uh and then uh the the transport. Uh so so is the CO2 going down into the soil? Is the CO2 going down into the ocean? Is it going back to the atmosphere? How's it how how when we look at those uh climate uh or or CO2 cycle graphs, one thing we always have to remember there's there's these big arrows going up and down from the ocean, right? So so there's every day lots of CO2 coming out, every day lots of CO2 going in.",
