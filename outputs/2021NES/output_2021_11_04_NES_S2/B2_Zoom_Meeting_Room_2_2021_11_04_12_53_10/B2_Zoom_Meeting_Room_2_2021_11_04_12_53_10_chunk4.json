Um and the general and always uh anti-fouling anti-scaling membrane. But generally it's one of those things where it's it's pretty much established that you're probably not going you can you can always anti-foul and anti-scale for a bit of time but it never indefinitely. Um and so you developing um those surfaces are important but then also developing maybe active ways to regenerate surfaces is also important. I think it's a little easier in a like a electro catalytic system with controlled environments. Whenever you mess with seawater um it's just it's it's it makes it a little bit harder. So um it is interesting from a fundamental perspective. I just think seawater is going to be super complex.",

Um and now it could be combined heat, power, water, CO2 sequestration um in these centralized large scale systems. Um, but I I haven't done the I interested in the back of the envelope calculation of like how much water uh is you know, it's interesting about desal. Most of the desal isn't like really just deep seawater. Um there's a lot of desal all around the world that's just, you know, brackish water and all these other components. So so see the capacity for seawater desalination. I wonder what um like how much carbon sequestration that that that's an interesting. I wonder if there's that calculation's been done.",

With climate change, there's such a large problem that we're going to need to do a bunch of DAC and a bunch of ocean capture and a bunch of other stuff too. So we might as well pursue all of them. Um, they're both hard, but we need them both.",
