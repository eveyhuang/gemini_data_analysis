So I think that's one area. The other area is how can you design your electrode system so you can scrape stuff off. The third question is how can you efficiently scrape stuff off. I think there's some design engineering that needs to happen there. And then once you figure all of that together, all of those parameters would then go into designing your contacting system like you were talking about.

So flow batteries are are an area I'm involved in where you you have a you have an architecture that basically allows you to change electrochemically change the chemical the composition of some electrolyte by flowing it through some porous electrode. So if you were to go the other way and do say CO2 release um instead of precipitation, then in principle you could take some bulk electrolyte, bulk amount of seawater and if you're able to just continuously supply protons to the solution then in principle you could you know, with a small fairly small footprint in terms of your electrochemical cell, you could release a bunch of CO2 from seawater that way.
