And to me, yeah, so taking the precipitations out of the ocean and using it as a um for example, building materials or other additives or even just pave the road uh would be not messing up with the treaty. But um I think there are challenges even just to find sites or locations that actually you can uh move a huge amount of ocean. Um so uh resources such as the um uh water desalination plants or something like that near the ocean coast that you can actually take a large amount of ocean water from the coastline and actually play with it and do experiments with it would be a good demonstration site to begin with, but I think um on top of my head I don't nothing about those kind of resources.

But anyway, they have they have deep uh experience in uh using the ocean for scientific research and dealing with all the issues associated with that. So if you're interested in this I I strongly encourage you to take a look at what they're doing and and contact them because they're very interested in everything that you're interested in.

So uh by releasing calcium magnesium into water, it uh automatically sucks CO2 into the water to equilibrate with that. So uh uh it forms a soluble bicarbonates and then eventually you can precipitate also the solid carbonates. Uh so we can do that either on land. if we do it on land that accumulates in soil, eventually accumulates in subsoil, eventually in aquifer. But if we do it uh in the ocean or on the beach, then it just sort of uh goes directly into the ocean. which is again sort of how nature does it, right? So so nature every day there's there's rocks dissolving into the rivers and so on. We're just trying to accelerate that by picking the more reactive rocks. the problem is that nature does it too slowly because all the rocks which are currently exposed to rain and and waves, they've already been weathered for millions of years. Uh but if we take those rocks which are more reactive and then we expose them, now don't now they they weather faster.",
