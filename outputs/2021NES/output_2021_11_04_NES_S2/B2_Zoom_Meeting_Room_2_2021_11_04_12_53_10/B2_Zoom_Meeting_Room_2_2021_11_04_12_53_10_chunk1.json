Um, and then the there's a software that's called OLI software that does a really good job of providing water chemistry values. Of course, they're always bounded um by certain um, you know, pH values and the activity a lot of these activity coefficients break down um but but yeah, look at John Reinhardt has some good work that has shown that, you know, a lot of these activity values that we use are completely like inappropriate.",

Um, I had a quick question um that I I I raised my hand but I think we'll just do the jumping in thing. Um, so uh, you know, with the direct air capture there's this, you know, we're do using surface contactors for we're using interfaces for volumetric to move volumetric uh uh, you know, air through. Uh it's the same thing I guess we're looking at mostly these um surfaces to look at a volumetric removal process and and are there any like reactor architectures that are like being developed to deal with the volumetric effect um or are we mostly looking at interfaces for these processes.",

            "transcript": "So Martha, I'm not aware of specific projects looking at scale up of this concept. I think there's still a lot of work to be done in terms of how you can design your electrode system and how you can really not just precipitate out a big chunk of calcium magnesium, whatever else carbonate you can produce, but there's some fundamental science to be done there if you want to selectively precipitate out calcium carbonate and selectively precipitate out magnesium or anything else. So I think that's one area. The other area is how can you design your electrode system so you can scrape stuff off. The third question is how can you efficiently scrape stuff off. I think there's some design engineering that needs to happen there. And then once you figure all of that together, all of those parameters would then go into designing your contacting system like you were talking about. So I I would think that the TRL for the full component needs to it's it's not quite there yet, right? I don't think I don't think it's more than five.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I might add that maybe uh I don't know this is getting at your question Martha, but if if you're thinking about sort of you know, trying to get away from surface area limitations, then perhaps you could consider a flow cell architecture where you can sort of change the chemical composition of a batch of electrolyte. So flow batteries are are an area I'm involved in where you you have a you have an architecture that basically allows you to change electrochemically change the chemical the composition of some electrolyte by flowing it through some porous electrode. So if you were to go the other way and do say CO2 release um instead of precipitation, then in principle you could take some bulk electrolyte, bulk amount of seawater and if you're able to just continuously supply protons to the solution then in principle you could you know, with a small fairly small footprint in terms of your electrochemical cell, you could release a bunch of CO2 from seawater that way. Um as long as you're transport, you know, you're not transport limited in terms of your the protonation reaction etc. So so that's one um one strategy.",

So I just want to make the point that um towards the end and Nanette and I realized that actually there are merits of doing um both acidified so taking the CO2 by using bacteria to chew up the CO2 in the acidified stream and also precipitate out of the basified stream and because the basified stream actually you mess up both the dissolved organic carbon and also the total alkalinity, but for the bacteria they only tackle with the CO2. Um, so so combination of both actually are highly tunable through this engineered approach which you can actually um mitigate some of the adverse effects of just precipitation. So,",
