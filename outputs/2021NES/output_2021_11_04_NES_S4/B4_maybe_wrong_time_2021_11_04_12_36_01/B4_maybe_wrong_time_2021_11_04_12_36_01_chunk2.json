Um, and and the like if one of the to to give an example, one of the systems that we look at are organic chromophores that can break down that can reduce CO2 and they're highly active but they don't last more than three or four turnovers and and we really don't know what gets them what what makes them tick for longer, right? Because none of these degradation pathways have been explicitly studied. Um, and while that is a huge handicap, I think there's a lot we can learn from existing literature on organic chemistry where there are parallels between like these degradation paths and synthesis reactions and and try to understand these systems better.",

And in and you know, as you say Ellen, you you put together, you know, let's say an electrochemical system and uh, you know, it may the the active uh species may get formed in situ and you don't have a way of being able necessarily to probe that. So I think um atomic scale probing of inter of active intermediates is something which is still really missing and especially it's it's extremely, you know, my I think I've been saying this now for 30 years in different context is is it's really difficult to look at interfaces. Um, and the time scale and the spatial scale you want to be able to uh you know, nail down what who the intermediates are. And those intermediates could end up as you're I think you're you're getting at Ellen being um spectators, right? They may not even be active. So it's how do you get to the active intermediates? Well, you have to be able to look very um at on very fast time scales potentially. So,",

            "transcript": "Uh, yeah, so actually I want to echo that because I I I was doing the quantum mechanical modeling for that for the intermediate actually the the question I keep asking myself and keep receive the question is like how much our optimistic model is going to reflect what exactly is going on in the experiment. I actually I predict something and it looks okay and but still I have no proof. So every time I actually when I meet experimental people I can say, can you actually do the in situ measurement? Can you actually tell the difference between like what you I mean, can you actually differentiate your signals of your intermediate from like carbon dioxide or from water. So I'd like to see if there's any opinion how we can actually do a better work about that. How can I know whether I predict is at least it makes sense it's what exactly is going on.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, um just to piggy back on some of the comments there about interfaces and looking at um processes as my group looks a lot at interfaces and how you can detect things at interfaces and a lot of times we have we we try to evaluate things at non equilibrium. Um, but most experiments are going to be equilibrium based or um close to equilibrium and so understanding these non equilibrium non equilibrium processes is important. Um, and also based off of what Ellen said, um, a lot of chemistry is sometimes driven by um what we call the messy things in your material. Um, and so I think that we need to have like really model systems um in if we're trying to understand these mechanisms. Um, because we all know that carbon can play a role in especially a lot of these um electro catalytic reactions and so um delineating between those will help us maybe not describe the mechanism not answer what the mechanism is but describe it.

Um, or or otherwise uh working with theory but um I I come at this from a surface science standpoint. And so, you know, I've spent a lot of time using um, you know, low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy to study atomic sites of model catalysts. Um, but then, you know, pushing that to ambient pressures and looking at how structures can change under different environments and um, you know, correlating that with um ambient pressure um, you know, spectroscopy experiments to really get a better insight.

So if you if you go there you can actually see what I'm typing and add things if you feel like we I missed something. Uh so I I'm thinking I'm thinking a little more broadly about this topic and I think before you start to think about reaction mechanisms, I think you have to kind of know what it is you want to make and one of the questions that came up in a conversation in the mini breakouts to begin or the ice breakers was um do we want to continue a carbon cycle or do we actually need to bury some carbon somewhere and that might actually tell you what mechanisms and what catalysis and what your actual ultimate products need to be. And so that's that's always what I think about when I think about this uh I'm not I'm not a molecular chemist or even really somebody who who looks at catalytic transformations uh directly and so I'm kind of thinking a little bit more broadly is give me a give me a goal and then I'll start to think about those those details.",
