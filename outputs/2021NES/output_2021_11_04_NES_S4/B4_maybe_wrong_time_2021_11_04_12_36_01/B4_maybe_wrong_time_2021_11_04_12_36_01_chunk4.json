Another one though that I would like to mention it's probably not really our research interest but if we want to reduce all this CO2 what are we going to oxidize again um on on the counter reaction is that obvious I'm not saying that this should be like a focus of discussion um but um I hope we are steering away from like all this I don't know HMF and bioethanol to aldehyde stuff um like I don't think that's scalable with the CO2 problem but you know it's it's a huge issue right like what are we actually going to oxidize.",

            "transcript": "Hydrogen is all hey my view it's all fair game because all of it gets us more flexible than most people in uh no I honestly I think that that what we have to be thinking about is that the chemical industry around the world was built on on pulling carbon atoms out of the ground and we have to get the whole chemical industry off of carbon and that includes making ammonia which also is is a CO2 source and um you know CO2 emission source and and um making hydrogen and and converting carbon dioxide and methane so it's all it all should be fair game.",

            "transcript": "Yeah I would just say although many different reactions could have different applications and may have different importances and the fundamental level they are often similar um in terms of physics and chemistry. So especially to like computational material scientists like me so we can model like water oxidation we can also model CO2 reduction and and nitrogen reduction as well so many of those models or measures can be applied um almost equally to all the different reactions and it's also very interesting to see some of the factors which are important to one reaction are also very important to the other reactions so this knowledge is kind of very transferable from one system to another yeah I think uh if we can figure out one uh representative system very well then we could also other systems could also benefit from such kind of study. Especially if if it can be validated by experiment that that the the method that is that is used um is accurate enough yeah.",

            "transcript": "Right that actually brings to another thing that I hope to discuss that is the connection between experiments and the theory or computations. So although there have been more and more collaborations I still feel um there is some gap especially if we want to uh understand the atomic level um reaction and the mechanism like Emily mentioned before I feel um it's very challenging to have the right experimental tools to determine especially in the heterogeneous system which site is the most active one there could be for example many sites of the same type but those sites could just be inactive what dominates the performance is just those very few sites. So it's hard to have those such kind of spatial resolution uh experimentally.",

            "timestamp": "06:00-07:31",
            "transcript": "On the other hand it's also although as quantum chemists we are uh we should be able to like accurately calculate everything for a given atomic structure but in reality we are limited by the computational resource some advanced measure may be just too complicated too expensive to use so we have to make some uh compromise you know for the efficiency. So yeah putting all this together sometimes I feel um the collaboration is not that very uh is not very efficient uh in in my case for example sometimes I have experimental colleagues approaching me and tell me oh I have a nano porous uh catalyst which is very good and uh they want to know why they are so good but to us the porous material has so many different structures so many possible sites it's just uh hard to build up right uh model and then um calculate the uh activity or the performance but uh more ironic sometimes we just cannot get the um like good activity agreeing with the experiments but but then that becomes uh a little bit bit embarrassing because uh the experimental people they are kind of reluctant to do more experiments because it's so hard to you know uh detect the exact structure for such material but for us we uh to us we cannot explain those experiments so then those collaborations do not go well.",

            "transcript": "Well I think you know first of all this is a philosophical issue but I I think the goal of a theorist should not be to just reproduce experiment the goal should be that you use experiments to to validate whatever method you're using and then you do one of two things you you work with the experimentalist if if you do get an answer that you're able to reproduce and say well this is this is from your theory you've been able to say what um what led to that particular uh result um by looking at the fundamental properties of of um your model.",
