I mean there there are ambient temperature SDMs today for example that can study certain things. So I think that it's a question of also there are specific techniques that can do these things, but in the end we need a combination of all of this. It's not only one single technique that will probably be able to do it all. So how do you bring the information from all of them together to, you know,",

So each and one of us are working on maybe the same problem, but we're bringing a specific answer to the bigger question. So how is that done? And of course, it's not only you contributing with something in me, it's also what is that small, small overlaps that what you're predicting or finding and what I'm doing actually overlap so that we have some kind of an agreement. That's one of the philosophically I think is a question that we need to which comes back to the benchmarking, of course.",

But to suddenly use a lot of copper in a lot of deployments, although copper is relatively abundant, we also use it for a lot of other things. So then we get to these weird bottlenecks of like electrical wires versus um these carbon technologies. So that's one another area of why we might think about um innovating new materials. You know, it's thinking about, well, you know, it's the same with like the ethanol food corn debate that's been around forever of we just need to think about what else we're doing with these and if that's going to cause issues. And I know that's tangentially related, but you can tell I mainly do like life cycle assessment and not these things.",

We we tend it's not like we're not using these plants for other things or these trees for other things, you know, we make paper and and all all sort and we for building materials and things like that. So as you there are many examples of this and you brought up the the corn ethanol um example as well. And and so I agree. I think as scientists and engineers are moving ahead in these in these directions, it's really important to think about the life cycle analysis and understand the abundance. Now, from a, you know, there's a lot of people on this call that are have chemistry backgrounds and so what we what uh chemists tend to think about is abundance of the of the of the element and and pat ourselves on the back that we're not using iridium, okay? Um because probably could be the most expensive element. I'm not sure, but you know, definitely trace amounts compared to copper.",

Um and so that gets interesting too. Whenever we're embedding something in a matrix and it's like at a relatively low concentration, often it's not economically or environmentally like viable to recover it from something. And so that's when it gets into like this interesting point of it needs to be designed actually so you can recover it or it has to be enough in it to make it um economical to recover. They talk about, when you think about mining, it's like the mineralogical barrier and these other barriers of like when is it economically efficient and when is it there's so little it's like a common rock with just like a little bit of something in it.",

Like these things that actually all have like engineering or physical or chemical numbers that we can put on. But how do you then actually, you know, quantify the impact on a society that is dealing with this waste uh and these type of things are never or very rarely talked about and put any we don't put any numbers on them. And you know, people tend to say, well, there is an impact, but how big is the impact really or how big is the is the, you know, how large of a problem is it actually? So there are actually uh a couple of people that I know of that are trying to, you know, introduce uh metrics for these type of things that we as engineers and scientists don't typically think about, right? What is the human impact and the problem that we're that we're contributing to. I don't know if Andrea if you are working on that as well, but it's certainly something that's, you know, it's very new to me. I don't know if anybody else has thought about this.",

Um, you know, like top down, bottom up kind of solvents and because sometimes like what we think is a green solvent isn't.
