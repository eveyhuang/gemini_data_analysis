            "transcript": "study kinetics and under those conditions, right? But now that I think we have a good system, right? A reactor that you can control mass transport and see the influence of mass transport in electrocatalysis. I think now what we see is that we can actually understand the mechanism of CO2 reduction on copper much easily. It makes a lot of sense and then what you have in gas diffusion electrodes is essentially a system where the residence time of carbon monoxide is very long. So once you have a system that has very long residence time for carbon monoxide, then you start to look at it more sort of as a plug flow reactor. So long story short, I think the challenge was to get an electrochemical cell that allows you to control mass transport and at the same time allows you to do product quantification and detection. Um, so I think we have accomplished that through and I think that that that should open the the door to scale up these systems.",

            "transcript": "Hi everyone. Um, my name is Greeshma Gadikota and I'm going to be uh reporting um for our team. I'd like I'm very grateful for David's support and for our facilitators Chris and Ellen as well as our excellent participants. So there were several aspects that came up uh over the course of our discussion uh particularly in the context of the need for DAC. Um, so one of the nice things about direct air capture is that it can be deployed independently of point source emissions and as we continue as we continue to use fossil fuels, there is going to be an increased need for DAC particularly from sectors that are challenging to decarbonize such as transportation. You're going to need DAC to clean up emissions from uh such sectors. Uh one of the interesting things that came up over the course of our discussion was the fact that there is considerable geographical variability in resources and how that might actually impact the deployment of CO2 capture and DAC technologies. So for example, if you're in regions of the world where uh moisture contents are different or in certain locations where the compositions of air are even different, separation technologies will need to be tailored for such regions. Uh this is a challenge but it's also an opportunity because it locks it it helps us unlock many fresh ideas and innovations in the context of DAC. Uh and perhaps you can take some of that understanding and translate that for CO2 capture as well from diverse set of um emissions. So with that said, our team uh sees the challenge of variability of compositions as something that can actually unlock more innovation. So we think it's actually a positive in the context of um innovating in this space. We also think that understanding durability, economic costs and incentive structures are crucial under real world operating conditions. And this actually goes back to the point that uh Carlos had made about uh the need for molecular scale science as well as the process scale engineering to come together to inform economic costs and incentive structure incentive structures. So there so really there is a need for cross scale thinking in this particular line of work. Uh this line this approach may be unconventional for some of the other research areas but in this area it is crucially needed. Uh another important consideration uh which is unique to DAC is that we need to consider the end fate of CO2 and that would really dictate where we would actually put or implement DACs that CO2 going to be stored underground, is it going to be coupled to utilization, is it going to be coupled to mineralization, in which case the kind of DAC technology that would get deployed might need to get customized. And also this part of the question of uh CO2 conversion to products and our team took the view that CO2 conversion to products is insufficient from the perspective of climate. We wrapped up our discussion from a rather big picture perspective of where DAC and CO2 capture are headed. And so when we look at industrial decarbonization, we're starting to see that there is defossilization of crucial commodities like ammonia, even cement and construction materials. This is something that's going to get realized over the course of the next 10 to 20 years or so. So in this context of defossilization, what is going to be the emerging role of DAC and CO2 capture? It's an open ended question but that is where we choose to wrap up our discussion. So thank you for the opportunity to present.",

Um, we took a little bit of a different perspective from the previous group and looked at a little bit more of the upscale challenge. Um, uh, I think the previous group kind of articulated that uh there's opportunity for DAC to be um uh operate uh independent of point of source um applications. Um, one of the things that was pretty like well established thought process that we talked in great detail was um the value proposition of combining point source um treatment with DAC. Um, given the fact that a lot of the infrastructure can be repurposed um and having that onsite is going to be potentially an economic advantage for that approach.",
