I guess that you're all quite experienced now at least either based on the single one you did yesterday or based on what you've seen from yesterday and your previous years experience. So let's see here so the topic let me just share to see if I can actually just so we're all on the same page. This is I mean you all have access to the slide deck so you should you know. Can everybody see my my screen? So I mean the topic of this particular one is mechanisms of electrochemical CO2 reduction and of course it should all be put in the larger context of negative emissions science and you know these are some of the questions that Richard also kind of very very briefly flashed and I don't want to spend too much time on these. Again we can come back to these if we don't cover them. What I would instead like to start with is just making sure that we have somebody who's recording and somebody who is willing to you know report out and then I would just suggest that we take a couple of moments to you know each and one of us just think of one or two questions that you think are appropriate to bring up and then we can basically start the discussion. So you should all I think be able to see this if I just have to stop. Um share my screen. This is the lovely part of Zoom right? Okay so in in the shared Google Drive you can see we this is group 2.4 mechanisms of electrochemical CO2. Um I'm Alex. Um I'm from UPenn and um I'm an associate professor there. I've been there for five years. I work on computational materials chemistry and science um and together with me you heard Emily is one of the co-facilitators. Um so please you know introduce yourself uh say a few words and then we'll just pick one or two people to do the recording and the reporting or if you are interested in doing the taking the task on just wave your hand and uh we can put your name down here. So who would like to go? Just to start a brief brief introduction on name uh where you're from and what you do. Do you want me to call out names as as I'm seeing them on the on the screen maybe? Okay Andrea you're you're at the top of my screen.",

I'm really worried Biden's not going to get reelected and we're going to end up with a government that won't invest properly in climate change mitigation and I decided that it was more important to work on research and leadership at the national lab at Princeton on and so I'm going to become the senior strategic advisor at the lab on sustainability science.
