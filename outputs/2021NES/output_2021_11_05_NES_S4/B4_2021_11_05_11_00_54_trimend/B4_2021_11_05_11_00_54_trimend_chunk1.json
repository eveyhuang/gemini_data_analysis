Uh my group here studies molecular catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction. Uh we also study interfaces of electrodes that have been modified with molecules. Uh so molecular modification of heterogeneous electrodes. Um and additionally, I am really interested in using infrared spectroscopy uh so developing operando uh methods to look at surfaces uh and doing time resolved infrared spectroscopy in solution.
