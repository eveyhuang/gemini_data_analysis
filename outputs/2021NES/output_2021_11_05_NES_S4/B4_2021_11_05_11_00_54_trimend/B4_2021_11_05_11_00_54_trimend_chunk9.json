            "transcript": "Um, so thanks Richard. Thanks to the team. We had a really great discussion. Unfortunately, we took the same question and answered it completely differently. Um, so you know, one of the pervasive themes that we had through our discussion was in terms of mechanisms of electrochemical CO2 reduction, do we even need to know the mechanism? And and this discussion was came out of um, how the chemical process industry has developed prior to this with a lot of Edison type experiments where they build things and maybe do a kind of um, high throughput or some kind of screening at a relevant industrial scale to find operational conditions or not. And so it's an open question of do we first need to understand mechanisms at an atomic lab scale. Um, and then if those do translate, um, we need to make that translation clear because both computationally and experimentally, um, looking at mechanisms are typically done on well defined surfaces or well defined systems with, you know, probably not a lot of flow or or or um mass transport. But if we look at what this technology would potentially need to be at a high TRL, um, probably the conditions would be very, very different and the mechanisms would probably change. And this has implications for both the materials, so materials durability, um, and selectivity requirements changing as a function of operation conditions, um, degradation modes will probably be different, you know, flooding happens at at larger scales and salt formations which may not need to be dealt with at the lab scale. So, um, it's the kind of the two prong question of do we need to wait or even to say, do we even have the time to wait and look at this from the atomic scale up and take every step there, or can we learn from some of the previous chemical process industry to see um, we need kind of the large scale testing and assessment there to feed the relevant conditions into the the fundamental science. So we recognize the need for both the applied and fundamental work, but I think one of the key messages is that we need that feedback loop to be much quicker and more direct and lean on what's been done with with other even electrochemical technologies. Um, you know, part of that was, you know, defining a lot of our questions here aren't even specific to CO2, they're in general for electrochemical reactions and um, you know, then figuring out if we need to translate something, what we can probe and what we need to probe. So there's a lot of um, spectroscopic and spectro electrochemical technique techniques that give kind of an averaging or an ensemble effect over a heterogeneous surface, um, and that we lose information about single sites and single atoms and how they react. And I think both of those can be useful in in determining uh what how we need to develop large scale um electrolyzer.",

So as part of the first year of the silo we have developed a gas tight rotating cylinder electrode cell where we put the model uh copper polyline copper electrode and we rotate it at different uh rates and as you rotate it even though you have the same potential you actually start to see dramatic changes in in selectivity. We already uh also we have the preprint in in our website. So what we see is that actually mass transport controls selectivity and the the the problem is a little bit more complex. So you actually have a lot of uh CO that is the main reaction intermediate that dissolves and hangs around near the surface of the electrode long enough. So they near the surface of the electrode it actually behaves as a sort of CSTR a continuous stirred tank reactor and then uh what happens is that we get a lot of high uh conversion of CO and uh theory is trying to do a lot of mechanistic understanding of of those systems actually on under high uh conversion of CO and uh typically you don't.",
