Uh are we making a final product or making an intermediate that needs to go to a thermal process after that. So how you couple these becomes more specific, but in general the idea of using waste heat um is absolutely necessary and we need to figure something like that out.",

I think it's also fair to ask, can we know any mechanism? And the sort of one mantra in catalysis is we don't know mechanisms, we propose mechanisms that are consistent with the available data and I guess their usefulness really then is in their predictive power. That is that if the the model or catalytic mechanisms allow us to make predictions, then they're useful and going back to Wilson's sort of question, I I guess if that mechanism that's developed at the bench scale at research for a well studied system in uh very stringent conditions, how well does that apply as you begin to uh make your system more complex or scale up to industrial scales is is is a really fair and good question to ask and I I I guess it it depends on how useful those models are at making predictions.",

However, what you can get from mechanisms is is predictions that then can be tested uh by well characterized experiments and then once you have that done, the thing that's interesting from from, you know, what you learn from understanding the mechanism is what what is the rate limiting step and how can you uh think about optimizing the system further in order to make it more efficient. And so I think that efficient or selective or or or what have you. So there are really good reasons for looking at mechanisms. It certainly is true that a lot of the, you know, processes in um in the chemical industry are Edison and uh and so, you know, we so I think to to Wilson's point though is is really important to and this came up yesterday in a different context too that that I guess in the plenary when we were having the discussion after the plenary, um that it's really important to think about these um the practical constraints um as a way to then dial go back and say, okay, if I put that constraint on my system, um then what does that also tell me about what I want to study?

But bringing it all together is is a totally different question, right? So I think it's as we're building up these important complex systems, it's as you point out Emily and others in here as well, right? It's not only about the activity, which a lot of the computational studies have focused on. It is also about the selectivity and the stability and the evolution and the dynamics, which is something that frankly we have we're ignoring, not because we we are not interested in the topics, but it's just because it's challenging as as Wilson pointing out, right?

Um, so I guess um, all I was going to say is that um, um, when we're thinking about all these mechanistic studies that we're doing and and and this is going back to what's already been said. But a lot of times even experimentally we're looking at things, you know, in aqueous or non aqueous conditions where we're limiting the CO2 delivery that's limiting the relative reaction rates of proton of hydrogen evolution versus CO2 reduction. When you go to an MEA electrolyzer with the GDE, everything is very different. Do some of the things we even care about matter at that scale? So I think my my point of all of that and that's just reiterating what's just been said.",

That's a really important point. It was exactly what the solar fuels hub was supposed to do. I don't know if you were around for that. Uh, but you know, didn't happen. So, but I do think if if there were enough, you know, famous people in CO2 reduction that came together and said, this is the type of test bed that run do your mechanistic studies, do all your measurements under whatever conditions you want, but then with the this geometry under these conditions with these flow rates of CO2, you know, and and water in this flow system, this is what you should be operating at to determine, you know, what your product selectivity is or these are the conditions you do to measure your relative selectivities and therefore you can get kinetic and mechanistic information from that.",

But I feel like that is not quite where the CO2 community is at. And of course there's no specific setups that which is what Charles was mentioning here. So yes, I mean, but what would those conditions be, which we were talking about earlier and how would that look like and how like who are the individuals that should actually agree on that? Because I do think that people who are interested in the fundamental science might actually disagree with others uh of what that should actually look like exactly. So the question is can one have a system that is changeable and adaptable to probe something that multiple communities would actually be interested in, I think. Um, what what is your opinion Charles on that? Because I know that you've in the past, I mean, you worked with the um, with Jcap and the and the water oxidation community. How did you actually in the end end up choosing the standards that were chosen and published? If you might just comment because you have some experience on this. If you don't mind sharing.",

One thing that came out of the benchmarking metrics was that people started gaming the system and basically the entire a flood of HEO papers came in where it was just it was very Edison. We mixed these together and we put them on a high surface area support and everything looks wonderful and we met this benchmarking criterion, which that was not the purpose of the benchmarking.",
