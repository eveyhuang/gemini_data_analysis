I in the in the group that I led yesterday, Ashley was there, so um and so was Gary. So uh um and you know, uh I thought it would be good to have just one person who would do both because as you're taking notes then you know what you would want to say. On the other hand, it was pointed out to me that there is something there's an advantage of having two because you can have uh the two people confer uh at the end to make sure that they have extracted what are the main bullet points.",
