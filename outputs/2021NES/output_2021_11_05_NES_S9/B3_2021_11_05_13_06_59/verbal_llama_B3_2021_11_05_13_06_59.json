I'm not I don't have an answer to this question but it might be a question that electrochemists could answer in 25 years. I know that there's a lot of electrochemical like CO2 reduction to formate or acetate that feeds bacteria but I mean is there some way to maybe make a cybernetic plant that borrows all of that machinery the healing and the CO2 capture that plants have and then we just somehow integrate biosensors or electrodes like we like we do into people's brains to to map their the electrochemical activity in their brains can we actually use that to to actually spur on biomass production rather than like trying to capture CO2 out of a flue gas we could actually jury rig a plant in order to to to couple it to its own benefits and strengths.
