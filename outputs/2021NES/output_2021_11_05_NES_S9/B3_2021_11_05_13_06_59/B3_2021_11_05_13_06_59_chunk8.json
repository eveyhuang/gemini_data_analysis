So the question is how to either heat it up or how to release the for example carbon like break the bond, chemical bond, right? So people are using like microwave or magnetic field induced heating. So at the end of the day, most of the current approach is heating up at targeted region, right? Instead of heating up the entire system, which is not most efficient. So if you can really target the heating to the certain area by non-energy non-thermal energy transfer. But maybe it could be other ways of doing it if you're doing it really electrochemically, right? Yeah.",
