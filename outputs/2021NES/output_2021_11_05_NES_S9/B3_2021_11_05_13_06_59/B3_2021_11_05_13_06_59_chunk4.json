            "transcript": "that can mix transformations using CO2 as a feed stock, which I mean a lot of people are are thinking about now. Um, it's hard. Um, there's been some success on carbon nitrogen and obviously carbon carbon coupling, but um, if you could actually use CO2 directly as a feed stock rather than converting it to something like CO or formate or formaldehyde that's then used as a chemical feed stock, but basically generating that in situ and then going all the way to whatever the end product is. Um, I have no idea if that would ever be scalable, but it's interesting to think about scientifically.",

So Department of Energy and basic energy science had a workshop with a subset of people, uh, subset of people. Uh, I think program manager from catalysis, separation, geochemistry, and one more I forgot. Four division materials came together and talked about what's the next big grand challenges in basic energy science. And what they came up with was reactive separation.",

            "transcript": "Well, I I mean just just what has always interested me is, you know, I mean on the molecular side when you're thinking about CO2 reduction, there are a lot of systems that are sort of ignored because they they get stuck at an intermediate, they get something absorbed to them that doesn't desorb, so they're not a good catalyst, but those are usually somewhat reactive and if you can find a way to actually use those as recycle those by instead of trying to go all the way to like a CO release or a formate release, but actually use that as an intermediate that can react with another precursor that basically scavenges it through an organic reaction, then you've got a way to to make something basically take some a failed reaction and make it useful for a side reaction that you weren't thinking about previously. I don't know. It's something that I've been thinking about a lot. I have no funding or research on this, but it's something I've been thinking about a lot recently.",

            "transcript": "So, so we've got CO2, which is relatively inert. You can still react it with some things, amine, stuff like that. But so, so we either to do a reactive capture, it seems like you either need uh to generate something that's similarly reactive or more reactive to to ammonia or something like that. Or well, even in this case, if you if you pre-absorbed it to something like that, you need something that's going to still be downhill in energy to to, you know, drive it off the amine. And so I I can't think of anything more creative than hydrogen, but it it seems like whether it's whether it's gaseous or it's, you know, protons plus electrons is is like can you when once you form carbamates, will they just reduce off under like if you if you had those at an electrified surface, just by P that kind of reactions? Anyone know? I I haven't looked into it.",

It is like moving towards like just changing the mindset, moving away from designing for high selectivity, away from high selectivity and towards um, uh, optimizing uh separations and catalysis simultaneously using deep learning aided catalyst design and mechanism discovery, um, is obviously important as well because I think we've been having an optimization of a single parameter in the field of catalysis and a single parameter in the field of separations.",
