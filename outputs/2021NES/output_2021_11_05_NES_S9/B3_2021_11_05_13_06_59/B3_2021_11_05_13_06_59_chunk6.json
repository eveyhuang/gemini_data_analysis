And then like DAC is to offset the small amount of diffuse emissions that we just can't otherwise address. So I I think that's where these numbers of like 500 megatons come from. Like it's much, much, much smaller than the CO2 we emit, but it's it's it's the portion that they say even in like the best case scenario where we plug up all the leaks and capture all the the post combustion and everything, this is like what's still going to be emitted.",
