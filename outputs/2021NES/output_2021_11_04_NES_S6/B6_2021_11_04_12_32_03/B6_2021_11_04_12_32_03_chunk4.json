I mean the advantage of the air of course is you can do it anywhere you don't have to be at a point source. But the ocean you have to be at the ocean. So why the ocean versus flue gas? I mean the ocean is a huge carbon sink so it's important to get it out of the ocean but it's still a pretty low concentration compared to a point source. And so you know the thermodynamics are just going to kill you I think in terms of the energy cost of getting it out. I mean it's already bad enough from air. From the ocean it's even more dilute. So I don't know. I mean maybe there's some trick with the pH of the ocean or something you can do but I'm not sure I see the advantage there. I mean it's a big problem but I don't see the advantage of going after the ocean. Maybe you can enlighten me.",

I think the advantage of the ocean is that it's a huge reservoir and so if you can get it out of the ocean you can make a big dent in the problem. And I think there are some tricks you can play with the pH. There's a recent paper in Nature that showed that you can use a bipolar membrane to split water and then use the protons to acidify the ocean and drive off the CO2. And then you can use the hydroxide to raise the pH back up and you can do this in a closed loop. So I think there are some clever things you can do. I'll put the article in the chat.",

They're not cheap and you have to have a lot of them to make a difference. And then you have to worry about fouling and all that stuff. So I think it's a cool idea but I'm not sure it's practical. I think a better way to go is to use a liquid sorbent. You can use an amine or something like that and you can just bubble the air through it and then you can heat it up to release the CO2 and you can do that in a closed loop. And I think that's a more practical way to go. I think the challenge there is the energy cost of heating it up but I think there are ways to get around that. You can use waste heat from a power plant or something like that. So I think that's a more practical way to go.",

You can use a metal organic framework or something like that and you can just pack it in a column and then you can just flow the air through it and then you can just heat it up to release the CO2 and you can do that in a closed loop and I think that's a more practical way to go.",

But I think we're getting there. We have a new material that we're really excited about. It's a cobalt-based material and it has a really high capacity for CO2 and it's also very stable.

But I think the challenge is the energy cost. I mean you're talking about a lot of electricity and so you have to have a renewable source of electricity and then you have to have a very efficient process. And I think that's the challenge. I mean we've been working on that as well. We have a new process that we're really excited about. It's a flow battery process and we think we can get the energy cost down to a reasonable level.

So I think you have to have a source of non-arable land to do that. And then you have to worry about the cost of harvesting and processing the algae.
