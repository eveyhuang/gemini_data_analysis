And I'm really looking forward to the discussion. So the way we're going to run this is we're going to go around and have everybody introduce themselves. And when you introduce yourself, please say your name, your institution, and then also, what is the grand challenge that you're most excited about tackling? And what is a crazy out-of-the-box idea that you have for tackling that grand challenge? And so we'll just go around and do that. And then after that, we'll have a more open discussion about some of the ideas that have been raised. And so I'll just start with myself. I'm Jeff Long. I'm at UC Berkeley. And the grand challenge that I'm most excited about is trying to figure out how to do carbon capture from the air. And a crazy idea that I have is to use metal-organic frameworks to do that. And so with that, I'll pass it on to George.",
