And I'm really looking forward to the discussion. So the way we're going to run this is we're going to go around and have everybody introduce themselves. And when you introduce yourself, please say your name, your institution, and then also, what is the grand challenge that you're most excited about tackling? And what is a crazy out-of-the-box idea that you have for tackling that grand challenge? And so we'll just go around and do that. And then after that, we'll have a more open discussion about some of the ideas that have been raised. And so I'll just start with myself. I'm Jeff Long. I'm at UC Berkeley. And the grand challenge that I'm most excited about is trying to figure out how to do carbon capture from the air. And a crazy idea that I have is to use metal-organic frameworks to do that. And so with that, I'll pass it on to George.",

I mean the ocean is a huge carbon sink so it's important to get it out of the ocean but it's still a pretty low concentration compared to a point source. And so you know the thermodynamics are just going to kill you I think in terms of the energy cost of getting it out. I mean it's already bad enough from air. From the ocean it's even more dilute. So I don't know. I mean maybe there's some trick with the pH of the ocean or something you can do but I'm not sure I see the advantage there.

I think the advantage of the ocean is that it's a huge reservoir and so if you can get it out of the ocean you can make a big dent in the problem. And I think there are some tricks you can play with the pH. There's a recent paper in Nature that showed that you can use a bipolar membrane to split water and then use the protons to acidify the ocean and drive off the CO2. And then you can use the hydroxide to raise the pH back up and you can do this in a closed loop. So I think there are some clever things you can do. I'll put the article in the chat.",
