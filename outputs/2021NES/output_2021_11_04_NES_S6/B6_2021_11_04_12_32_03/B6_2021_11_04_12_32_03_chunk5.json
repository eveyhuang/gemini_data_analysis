So I thought I would just give a brief overview of what we're trying to do and then we can just go around and talk about what we've been doing and what we're thinking about. So the idea is to try to come up with some novel ideas to address some scientific challenges. And so I think we have a pretty diverse group of people here with different backgrounds and different expertise. And so I think we can come up with some really interesting ideas. So I thought I would just start by saying a few words about what I've been thinking about and then we can just go around and talk about what we've been doing and what we're thinking about.",

One is, you know, we've been working on these metal organic frameworks for a long time and we've been thinking about how to use them for gas storage and separation and catalysis. But I think there's a lot of other things we can do with them. And so I've been thinking about how to use them for sensing and for energy storage and for other applications. And so I think there's a lot of potential there. And then the other thing I've been thinking about is how to use them for quantum computing. And so I think there's a lot of potential there as well.",
