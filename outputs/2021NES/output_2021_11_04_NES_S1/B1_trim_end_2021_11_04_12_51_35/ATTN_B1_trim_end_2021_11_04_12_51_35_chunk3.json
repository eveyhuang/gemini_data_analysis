            "transcript": "we said, okay, but how about if we do thermal catalysis in and elevated temperatures and pressures under a CO2 hydrogenation environment and and we are, you know, we're seeing sort of similarities in terms of in terms of selective production of the of the target of the target product. And so so this was all based on an electrochemical conversion experiment that gave us this feedback. And now we're, you know, sort of like purposefully thinking about what other environments we could expose the surface. So we could think about it from that angle and then and then obviously the angle of what other changes we can make to the actual environment of the surface so we could help with some of these reaction trajectories. So the answer is yes, it could happen in both worlds, but but I think both worlds could talk to each other and and and and develop design principles.",

            "transcript": "So we were actually thinking about this problem maybe from a different perspective but I think at the end of the day we're all in agreement that this is a an important idea of of diverging mechanisms at different temperature states. And the way we kind of started thinking about this is because we noticed our our electrolysis is heating up. We have these very resistive cells and we've started thinking about localized heating at the points of maximal resistance. And we actually have some evidence that in a canonical molecular electrocatalyst that makes carbon monoxide and water with just a proton source in acetonitrile that the product actually forms at the frit and not the electrode surface which raises the question of transport. Normally we have this paradigm where you know the product's formed at the electrode and you know that's where we study everything but I think there's like a huge landscape of product distributions that we're just missing out that nobody's really seen. So if anybody's interested in a project on that I'd love to to talk more about it.",

I'm actually part of the NSF center of chemical um CCI the integrate and our center is about integrated catalysis. So we thought a lot about integrating electrochemical catalysis with other gas phase or organometallic ones into that. And and exactly something we actually we have some similar experience with Oana but we purposely try to have this kind of synergy to to get to to things running. Yeah.",

So I think there's a multiple people have echoed this theme right about about learning from yeah or the coupling of thermal photocatalysis, electrocatalysis or learning from each other. Uh perhaps one question is I mean what the battery folks have learned after years of my battery is better than yours is that maybe there's room for everyone right? So is there particular products that lend themselves to different a particular type of catalysis? Would you say like okay if I if I need to make this this is so much better I'm not going to try to do this electrocatalytically this is thermal catalysis is better.",

And I think the electric catalysis community has really embraced thinking about thermodynamics and like hydricity and and understanding there of how do we get CO2 and not formate or vice versa. Um what's less known and is only now starting to emerge is the temperature effect on these parameters. And I think it's important to consider that if we do have either a genuine thermal catalysis that is known to operate at a higher temperature or if we do have these localized you know higher temperatures um how much is it changing the thermodynamics knowing that it's not going to impact you know the thermodynamics of CO2.",
