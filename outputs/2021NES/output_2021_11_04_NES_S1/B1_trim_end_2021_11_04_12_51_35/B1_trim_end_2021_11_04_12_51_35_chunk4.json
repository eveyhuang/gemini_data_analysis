            "transcript": "Yeah I think to sort of piggyback I was just gonna say to piggyback on what Chong was saying I was just thinking that like we can't this thing of like maybe electrochemistry is the best you know is the most effective at putting CO2 to CO but at the end of the day we want to get a liquid fuel out then we need to couple the CO into some like thermo-catalysis process that can like get you to the higher carbon products and so where the goal is CO2 as the base feedstock to get us to like a net that would get us to like a net zero case and so this is where which mode of catalysis is most appropriate for like which step and I think Chong is right you don't have to have a silver bullet that can get you from CO2 all the way to the to the end product this is where the modularity comes in.",

So so I mean my first comment was if our target is negative emission not only net zero I think we got to think big picture what the end game is going to be and I'm not opposed to CO being an intermediate and I think there are plenty of pathways for processing it in different ways but I would really reconsider that we have a distributed feedstock which is CO2 which is literally everywhere so can we couple that with a distributed demand and what is that distributed demand is it liquid fuels is it liquid chemicals are we talking about driving it to carbonates? I mean carbon as a resource if you can build it into a chain you can do anything with it so I guess I think having an end game would help us answer some of these questions as opposed to just focusing on CO production.",

So if you're building a CO2 electrolyzer we can do that and make CO at relatively high efficiencies people have demonstrated that at least on small scale and then so is this really that we need to so you know again I'm funded in CO2 reduction I'm not trying to put down electrochemical CO2 reduction at all and I hope I continue to get funded on mechanistic studies but is this more of an engineering issue if we're thinking about because we know how to we also know thermal catalysis we can hydrogenate CO very well in industry with H2 wherever that H2 comes from we can hydrogenate CO.",
