All right so uh when you do modeling right or if you're trying to study kinetics right you try to uh study kinetics under low conversion conditions. All right and then so you try to write an equation rate of K uh multiplied by the concentration of something right but that uh will give you a different reaction rate if it's in a CSTR reactor or a PFR and so a lot of the the mass transport actually plays a lot of effects and I think a challenge with theory is that you try to fit the the experiments with the assumption that the experiments are correct but actually they are not. So uh what we have developed is an electrochemical cell that allows you to take that copper flat polycrystalline copper and rotate it at different uh rotation speeds and then we do gas product detection and and and liquid product uh quantification. So because we can understand the mass transport and how it changes selectivity because it changes a lot the selectivity but what we realize is that uh the main reaction intermediate is CO and then you would not like to study the the the kinetics of CO conversion at under 95% conversion but that's actually what is happening. Most of the CO that you make at the surface it actually desorbs and actually it lingers around the electrode because it cannot be in the reaction zone it does not travel uh away fast enough so it actually behaves sort of as a CSTR and then when you start looking at production rates of uh ethylene or ethanol or all these those are actually affected by the residence time of carbon monoxide near the surface of the electrode. So through the running of the copper like at different rotations different temperatures different uh bicarbonate concentrations we have started to break down uh those paths right and it it it's mind-boggling that all these things were already explained in the 70s. All the equations all these rotating cylinder electrodes I mean this is the most frustrating thing I didn't I mean we're just not we don't know good electrochemistry. It's uh but all these things were developed already by by people in the 70s and then the mechanism is is very uh nice. So you have the rate-limiting step is CO2 to CO and then that CO is just is inside of a CSTR reactor and how you change all these cation effects go go away once you uh start to to to to understand what what is happening is not a double layer effect but it's just a residence time and uh ",

But moving away from that and assuming that it's great, you know, the problem that I see is that it's becoming saturated, CO2 reduction is being saturated with groups that publish and say, I have a new catalyst, it's the best ever, here it is. And benchmarking gets away from some of that, but what we saw when we did HER and OER benchmarking is everyone just tweaked their system to meet the new benchmarks and they basically, I mean, we got lots of high surface area nickel foam supported OER catalysts that of course have high activity per geometric area, but then it took a back seat to, I mean, sort of the mechanistic studies took a back seat to that because if you didn't meet certain performance metrics, you couldn't get published. And so there would be no way for you to think about, well this catalyst didn't work as well, here's why it didn't work as well, going back to some of the failure modes. That sort of fell away and I think it really hurt the OER community for several years because there were just so many papers about, well we have the best catalyst, look, it's 200 millivolt overpotential, it's 150 millivolt overpotential based on basically fake metrics because they gamed the system.

We have these very resistive cells and we've started thinking about localized heating at the points of maximal resistance. And we actually have some evidence that in a canonical molecular electrocatalyst that makes carbon monoxide and water with just a proton source in acetonitrile that the product actually forms at the frit and not the electrode surface which raises the question of transport. Normally we have this paradigm where you know the product's formed at the electrode and you know that's where we study everything but I think there's like a huge landscape of product distributions that we're just missing out that nobody's really seen.
