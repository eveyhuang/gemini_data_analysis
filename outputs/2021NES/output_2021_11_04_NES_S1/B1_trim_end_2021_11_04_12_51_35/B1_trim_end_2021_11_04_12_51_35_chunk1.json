We don't know much about on what condition experiments failed but sometimes those experiments are useful because we know what's the what works but if you really want to explore new mechanism something is you really want to know from previous experience so we don't need to repeat them again is on what condition that what can we learn from previous unsuccessful experiments and also including sometimes you're generating some undesirable products or called undesirable.",

So thinking about photocatalysis like sure you're generating a photo electron that has enough reducing potential to get you to that first step reduce CO2 but is it going to actually make it there before it disappears right. And so thinking about and and sometimes that's not always clear a priori right and so this is where coming um failed experiments are useful being like well on paper this material seems like it's a great you know could you know has the right thermodynamics but then when we go to do the experiment we don't get the photocurrents that you would expect because we have these others and unanticipated processes and and how can we start to anticipate those um more ahead of time or um start to try to understand um how to control those as well.",

Um and one thing that actually came up a lot last year when we were talking about this is just with these heterogeneous catalysts the challenge of figuring out what your active sites actually are because you have this surface that has all kinds of different things on it and odds are that your active catalytic sites for the most part are some sort of minority of your surface and how can we control that how can we know from the modeling side which ones we should be studying um because from the modeling side yes there's a lot that we can learn but we also need to know where to look.",

I'm wondering if actually maybe this is a a comment or question for everyone and and it might be oversimplified but here it goes. when I think about electrochemical conversion of CO2 uh immediately what comes to mind is you know the poster child uh monometallic surface copper and then can we claim victory there can we claim at this point after I don't know how many decades that we understand the mechanism to reducing CO2 electrochemically on a monometallic copper surface.",

            "transcript": "So so let me let me say this so uh I I think so we found as as the main challenge is that we didn't even understand the electrochemical cells that we use. All right so uh when you do modeling right or if you're trying to study kinetics right you try to uh study kinetics under low conversion conditions. All right and then so you try to write an equation rate of K uh multiplied by the concentration of something right but that uh will give you a different reaction rate if it's in a CSTR reactor or a PFR and so a lot of the the mass transport actually plays a lot of effects and I think a challenge with theory is that you try to fit the the experiments with the assumption that the experiments are correct but actually they are not. So uh what we have developed is an electrochemical cell that allows you to take that copper flat polycrystalline copper and rotate it at different uh rotation speeds and then we do gas product detection and and and liquid product uh quantification. So because we can understand the mass transport and how it changes selectivity because it changes a lot the selectivity but what we realize is that uh the main reaction intermediate is CO and then you would not like to study the the the kinetics of CO conversion at under 95% conversion but that's actually what is happening. Most of the CO that you make at the surface it actually desorbs and actually it lingers around the electrode because it cannot be in the reaction zone it does not travel uh away fast enough so it actually behaves sort of as a CSTR and then when you start looking at production rates of uh ethylene or ethanol or all these those are actually affected by the residence time of carbon monoxide near the surface of the electrode. So through the running of the copper like at different rotations different temperatures different uh bicarbonate concentrations we have started to break down uh those paths right and it it it's mind-boggling that all these things were already explained in the 70s. All the equations all these rotating cylinder electrodes I mean this is the most frustrating thing I didn't I mean we're just not we don't know good electrochemistry. It's uh but all these things were developed already by by people in the 70s and then the mechanism is is very uh nice. So you have the rate-limiting step is CO2 to CO and then that CO is just is inside of a CSTR reactor and how you change all these cation effects go go away once you uh start to to to to understand what what is happening is not a double layer effect but it's just a residence time and uh",
