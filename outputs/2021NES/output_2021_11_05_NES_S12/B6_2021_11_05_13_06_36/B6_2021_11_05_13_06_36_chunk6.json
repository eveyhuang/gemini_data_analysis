So for example, uh in the in the last uh breakout session I I mentioned there is one paper uh in nature catalysis which claims that without the content uh you cannot come CO2 reduction, which is uh somewhat surprising to me. And um so so the explanation, the mechanism is that uh so they proposed that uh because the chemically absorbed CO2 is not very stable unless it has a content nearby so that this content can maybe through some electrostatic interaction it can stabilize the negatively charged CO2.

So um so you see a very strong dependence on the presence of the cation, specific cations with alkali metals um working best. the larger the better cesium um stabilizes both the pathway towards CO the most. So it it it reduces the activation barrier and it also stabilizes the pathways to hydrocarbons. Okay, so then I I essentially was pushing this narrative actually also like some other people with the who who who who made the paper that you need a cation to do this.",

And then suddenly the whole thing seems a bit more complicated because the original story in the CO2 reduction is that in the first electron transfer reaction where you kind of bend the CO2 um and put an electron on it, then you need the stabilizing force of the cation. And this would then mean that this reaction is not proton coupled.",

            "transcript": "But then we got data which actually pretty strongly shows that this step is proton coupled. So then what is the role of the cation? So you see, I think this thing is still fully open. So I'm I'm very confused because the cation would only be required if you bend the CO2 and put a negative charge on that you need to compensate, but if this step is proton coupled, your intermediate is neutral. So then you don't need to stabilize it anymore. So for me, I remain very I I just want to share this. I remain some of this is unpublished. I I remain very confused about this whole story as to what is going on in this system.",

I guess the computational techniques are even more behind than than the aqueous uh systems. So going back to the you know, the role of the salt, I mean, depending on how that double layer is structured, it's it's just going to change. So I don't know um maybe the computational experts can help the other way around, you know, help interpret the experiments better because most of the non aqueous media, especially like you're coupling a novel catalyst with a non aqueous media, things get really complicated and I mean sure we can all run, you know, electrolysis experiments and you know, measure potentials, but what does it all mean really? Um so I guess that kind of underscores the need for you know, improved computational methods and you know, like better um in situ like spectroscopy techniques maybe about the interface.",
