Um, and so I don't think that's an issue. I think Xiao's absolutely correct that, you know, the materials matter, right? So, um, I I was in an H2 workshop earlier this year and um, you know, I I I like abundant metals and I said something about like we need better um, we need to replace platinum and uh, Kathy Ares and people who work in this industry were like not a problem. We've gotten loading so low that it's not an issue. The the non-oxide side is still an issue, of course, as you mentioned, but um, the reductive side it's it's really a loading issue and then it is a materials cost, right? So membranes are expensive.",

Although I probably recognize that there're not a lot of things that you want to do at that scale that we want to do CO2 reduction, but we might be a portfolio of things. So, yeah, I'm I'm not, you know, not giving up on that.",

We use porous electrodes, but it can still take hours to electrolyze a solution, um, which uh, but you know, we've we work with thick a little bit and then I know Dave has worked on redox flow batteries. It's like they have, you know, Ketchum black. They they're basically other people are working on the problem of electron transfer. Um, my colleague Shane is big proponent of photochemical processes because then you, you know, don't have to worry about contact area. I'm not opposed that either. I I think we just get creative.

They make persulfates um, that uh, go into fertilizer for the most part. Um, and and and many other chemicals and the entire reason for them being situated near Niagara Falls was cheap hydropower, right? Because it's an electrochemical process and the way they've scaled it uh, for again also 100 years, they use lead electrodes for everything. Massive huge lead electrodes incredibly environmentally bad, but it works works great for them. And so the uh, environmental agency in New York called us and said, you know, see if you can replace them with something better. Uh, but uh, but yeah, it it it's it's chemistry that works at huge scales. They have like, you know, tons of uh, persulfates that are that are kind of getting out there. It's you can so if you can find something like that that you can make that goes into other industries, I think Jenny's point is is excellent.",

So if maybe um, you know, combining these two thoughts together, it sounds like I mean, there's definitely a role that electrochemistry and electrolysis could play, but are maybe like should we maybe focus on what kind of product we're making.",

Uh, those if it can be scalable for energy storage, it can it can definitely hopefully be scalable for capture as well.
