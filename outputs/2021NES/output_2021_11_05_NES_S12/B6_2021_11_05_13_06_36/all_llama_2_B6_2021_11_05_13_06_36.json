For example, some people say we need iridium oxide um for an oxygen evolution reaction, but we have absolutely nearly not enough iridium on planet Earth um to to implement.

So what what tools do we need really need in order to understand the correct mechanism, you know, uh apart from, you know, what the what's happening on the electrode surface in terms of, you know, whether if it's a copper surface, you're characterizing copper, but what could what can we think about in terms of the methods that can probe the liquid, right?

That's so that's one of the things I've been thinking about what some of the sort of cutting edge strategies are to do that because then presumably you could take a, you know, homogeneous catalyst that's, you know, well known to be successful and if you could just find a way to put it on the surface and make it stable, then you don't have to worry as much about um some some of the more complex mechanistic questions.",

Uh the other question I always would have is um is would there be a need for a membrane? And if so, what's the best assembly to put there that would make the whole process cheaper? Um and another thought I put down here and it's not very fundamental, but it's uh like where would you put this uh system? Would you put it close where you have a carbon source as well as uh uh renewable energy?

Because it's an electrochemical process and the way they've scaled it uh, for again also 100 years, they use lead electrodes for everything.

I think that uh we want at some point the answer the the sort of judge be industry and the commercial um um entity actually implements it. I I think that, you know, for a lot of technologies, you have all these competitive things and then it's only becomes like a solution when it's implemented by industry. So I don't know if we can come up with an answer because we're developing the methods. I think that um the judge at the end is society has to take one of these systems and implement it. And uh so I don't know if electro catalysis is implemented in industry um uh right now for carbon capture in any way. I think the startups are really the the interface. So um that's my opinion.",
