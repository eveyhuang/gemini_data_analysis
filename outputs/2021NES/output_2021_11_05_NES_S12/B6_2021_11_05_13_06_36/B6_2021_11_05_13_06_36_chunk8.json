And then when I actually looked at the literature, it's really hard because it's kinetically inert and um there's actually very little I I was shocked considering how oxidizing it is, how little chemistry we we know about it, about how it binds to things, how it reacts to things. You know, nature uses it, there are enzymes that they're into reductases, but um I I just think that we just don't know much about the chemistry of it. Um",

And then really the problem in in general with when you're thinking about air is that the most reactive thing, I think from my perspective in air is oxygen, followed by water. And then CO2 and then N2. So the selectivity is difficult. Um and then, you know, with all, I think with all electrochemical reductions, if you're going to be making a hydrogenated product effectively, then you got to worry about hydrogen, right?
