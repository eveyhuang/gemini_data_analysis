Um I think the current approaches we have uh of electrochemical systems do not seem very very scalable. Maybe they are, right? So my so you see this is an open thought. I'm looking at batteries. This is also an electrochemical system, somehow similar designs to what people are discussing. And somehow it seems to be a little bit scalable. But uh at least we can make implementations, right? In different contexts. But I'm just wondering like as these things get scaled up, how is this going to look like and are we going to hit the bottleneck and where are these bottlenecks, right? For example, some people say we need iridium oxide um for an oxygen evolution reaction, but we have absolutely nearly not enough iridium on planet Earth um to to implement. I don't know the numbers but these numbers are being pushed sent around quite a bit um particularly by a colleague of Jenny, um Plamen Atanasov. So uh um.",

You know, how exothermic is your process? How much energy do you need to put in? How much energy um do you get out? Is it is it is it going to blow up when you when you do it on 100 mole scale. Um so I guess my interest in um the electrochemical uh conversion and capture even um uh kind of raises the question in um how do we think about temperature in electrochemical reactions and and heat management. Um and I think this is a question that the um electrochemical process engineers have um answered over the over the years.

So I'm a theorist, so I can use quantum mechanics to calculate the activation energies for different electro chemical reactions. And then I try to look for experimental data to validate or disapprove my computational model or methods. But I found there is not much um experimental data available. For example, what is the activation energy for like platinum 111 surface for hydrogen evolution reaction? I couldn't even find such uh data which I thought there should be a lot. So I wonder so maybe this is related um maybe not much people are doing like the temperature dependent electrochemistry so that you can extract the activation energy.

But um, I am curious about electrolyte design. So, um, can we aid this catalysis by, you know, having specific electrolytes that might stabilize CO2 or CO2 intermediates at the surface. Um, and, you know, obviously the question is, you know, how how fast we can achieve the CO2 uh conversion in, you know, in relation to how much, how fast we can capture. So those are the uh things I'm interested in and since my background is on mostly um non-aqueous electrolytes, um, you know, when you when you go through non-aqueous electrolytes, things can get messy. So one of the challenges in my research is, you know, what are the tools we can have in order to, you know, study these interfaces which are kind of buried interfaces. So what what tools do we need really need in order to understand the correct mechanism, you know, uh apart from, you know, what the what's happening on the electrode surface in terms of, you know, whether if it's a copper surface, you're characterizing copper, but what could what can we think about in terms of the methods that can probe the liquid, right? Or the CO2 salvation environments in the liquid or like how CO2 is oriented, what it interacts with. Um those are the, you know, questions that I'm really interested in and um I'm looking for different techniques um that might be suitable to do this.",

I think in every group electrochemistry has come up and are there wet processes that would be more effective being done in a non-aqueous um system versus an aqueous system.
