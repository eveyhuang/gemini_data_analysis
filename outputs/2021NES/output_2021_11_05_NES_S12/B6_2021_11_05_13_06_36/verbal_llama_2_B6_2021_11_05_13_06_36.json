This is also an electrochemical system, somehow similar designs to what people are discussing. And somehow it seems to be a little bit scalable. But uh at least we can make implementations, right? In different contexts. But I'm just wondering like as these things get scaled up, how is this going to look like and are we going to hit the bottleneck and where are these bottlenecks, right? For example, some people say we need iridium oxide um for an oxygen evolution reaction, but we have absolutely nearly not enough iridium on planet Earth um to to implement. I don't know the numbers but these numbers are being pushed sent around quite a bit um particularly by a colleague of Jenny, um Plamen Atanasov. So uh um. ",

So so maybe electrochemistry is at the heart of all the negative emissions technologies that that is a possibility but it would really help me to know like kind of where what what is the consensus like where where will electrochemistry come in and play like the dominant role. Maybe at this stage this is too early to say that and we are in a phase where we're kind of like scouting around and trying to figure out like how how we're solving this problem in the first place, right? But I I generally think um yeah, I I really would like to figure out um like where uh where we are where where electrochemistry is is is making an impact and whether there are like a certain set of categories maybe electro catalysis, electrochemical capture. Um I don't know, we don't have much time left but if if anyone uh wants to chime in, I would be interested. ",
