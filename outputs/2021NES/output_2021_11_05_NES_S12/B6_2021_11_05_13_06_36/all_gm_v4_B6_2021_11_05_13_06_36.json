This is also an electrochemical system, somehow similar designs to what people are discussing. And somehow it seems to be a little bit scalable. But uh at least we can make implementations, right? In different contexts. But I'm just wondering like as these things get scaled up, how is this going to look like and are we going to hit the bottleneck and where are these bottlenecks, right? For example, some people say we need iridium oxide um for an oxygen evolution reaction, but we have absolutely nearly not enough iridium on planet Earth um to to implement.

Um so I guess my interest in um the electrochemical uh conversion and capture even um uh kind of raises the question in um how do we think about temperature in electrochemical reactions and and heat management.

I think that uh we want at some point the answer the the sort of judge be industry and the commercial um um entity actually implements it. I I think that, you know, for a lot of technologies, you have all these competitive things and then it's only becomes like a solution when it's implemented by industry. So I don't know if we can come up with an answer because we're developing the methods. I think that um the judge at the end is society has to take one of these systems and implement it. And uh so I don't know if electro catalysis is implemented in industry um uh right now for carbon capture in any way. I think the startups are really the the interface. So um that's my opinion.",
