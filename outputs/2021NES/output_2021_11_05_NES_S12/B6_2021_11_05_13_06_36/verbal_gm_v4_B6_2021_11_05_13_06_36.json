But um, I am curious about electrolyte design. So, um, can we aid this catalysis by, you know, having specific electrolytes that might stabilize CO2 or CO2 intermediates at the surface. Um, and, you know, obviously the question is, you know, how how fast we can achieve the CO2 uh conversion in, you know, in relation to how much, how fast we can capture. So those are the uh things I'm interested in and since my background is on mostly um non-aqueous electrolytes, um, you know, when you when you go through non-aqueous electrolytes, things can get messy. So one of the challenges in my research is, you know, what are the tools we can have in order to, you know, study these interfaces which are kind of buried interfaces. So what what tools do we need really need in order to understand the correct mechanism, you know, uh apart from, you know, what the what's happening on the electrode surface in terms of, you know, whether if it's a copper surface, you're characterizing copper, but what could what can we think about in terms of the methods that can probe the liquid, right? Or the CO2 salvation environments in the liquid or like how CO2 is oriented, what it interacts with.
