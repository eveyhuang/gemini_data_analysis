They just they just don't know how to do it. And so I was I I don't think, you know, she usually typically does pharmaceutical stuff. So they're all smaller scale than you know, not bulk chemicals, but certainly if we can find ways that organic chemists could utilize CO2, I think they would be interested in that as well. I was surprised to hear that.",

I think I believe thermocatalytically incorporating it. But if that could be done electrocatalytically, that would be I think quite attractive.",

So if you really go solid or uh to to to take out if you remember some of the numbers from um Baroness Brown's talk last year. So if if if we leave it until 2100, we're going to need to take huge amounts out as solids and liquids. Um that may not have any value. And how do we do that and who pays for it.",

CO2. But we we brought up and I have no idea what the actual economics are like. Um but the system that McFarland uh at UCSB published where they take methane and they basically are able to dehydrogenate it and then the product instead of being CO2, which is hard to separate, is solid carbon and they do it on these magnesium melts and he did start a company on it and he's published a couple papers on LCA on it and and and TEA.
