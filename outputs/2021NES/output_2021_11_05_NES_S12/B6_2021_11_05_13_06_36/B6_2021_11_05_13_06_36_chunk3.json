Um, with regard to uh CO2 conversion, I'm not an expert in this area, but um I as I mentioned before, I have been thinking about uh ways one can chemically functionalize electrodes for various source separation processes. And I I understand that this is a topic I think in the CO2 reduction community, um, which is, you know, thinking about marrying um the advantages of heterogeneous catalyst with homogeneous catalyst.",

That's so that's one of the things I've been thinking about what some of the sort of cutting edge strategies are to do that because then presumably you could take a, you know, homogeneous catalyst that's, you know, well known to be successful and if you could just find a way to put it on the surface and make it stable, then you don't have to worry as much about um some some of the more complex mechanistic questions.",

Um, and then I I was also thinking about the issue of mineralization. So going away from converting CO2 to something useful. I mean that's always great if you can convert it to something that people want to buy or people want to use immediately.",

Um, and in my sort of previous uh position actually during my grad school days, I worked on lithium air batteries, which is a chemistry that many of you might be familiar with where you're taking O2, the moon shot was that you take O2 in atmosphere and you turn it into lithium peroxide, which is a solid and you can go back and forth and it's a nice rechargeable battery.",

So we always look at the one reductive electrode, but what would be the best pairing of the anode is one of the questions. Uh the other question I always would have is um is would there be a need for a membrane? And if so, what's the best assembly to put there that would make the whole process cheaper? Um and another thought I put down here and it's not very fundamental, but it's uh like where would you put this uh system? Would you put it close where you have a carbon source as well as uh uh renewable energy? So sort of the geographical location might also impact it in case you need to you want to remove the need to transport um concentrated CO2. I think that also feeds into like a life cycle analysis.",
