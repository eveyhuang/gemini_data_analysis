We're really interested in weird stuff that might be going on in Titan. We're interested in liquids, I'd say is kind of our the main focus of our lab right now, thinking that you need a liquid phase because if things are gaseous, they're they're too far apart to be able to do much and if they're everything's in a solid phase, you can't diffuse around to react. So we're interested in novel liquids and what would happen in them.",

And I would say my lab right now focuses on mineral organic chemistry. So we do, for example, aqueous chemistry with mineral catalysts driving organic reactions. We have some high pressure systems looking at that. We look at both synthesis of simple organics and then complex ones like cofactors or peptides and are interested in seeing how that can help us define life on other worlds.",

So I work on developing computational methods that can efficiently simulate the reactions and determine reaction rates. So for example, we can, given a set of starting molecules, starting species, we can automatically enumerate all the possible reactions and then calculate their reaction rates. We can set up dynamic, like molecular dynamic simulation based on ab initio methods that can automatically watch over the time how the reaction happens. So that's what I work on and I especially I focus on how to accurately describe the solvent environment, like liquid reactions and the high pressure reactions.",

Can be a question that you have, can be a thought that you have about any of the prompts. So, what are the requirements for the emergence of life? And once we've managed to check that one off, if we can get that one at all. What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for life? Do the CHNOPS elements, or CHNOPS elements are thought to be necessary for life as we know it, but all of these may not have been essential to origin of life processes. What's the viability of origin of life hypotheses that exclude one or more of these required elements? Can we do it with anything less than the full the current full slate? Is it possible to get all the way to LUCA with a different elemental composition than we observe in Earth life today? What are possible critical relationships between early Earth environments and the conditions that were essential for prebiotic chemistry and the eventual emergence of life? For example, atmospheric redox, emergent land masses, the roles of impacts, and so forth. By what pathways can habitability and life emerge and evolve on planets other than Earth, including, for example, ocean worlds and water worlds?",
