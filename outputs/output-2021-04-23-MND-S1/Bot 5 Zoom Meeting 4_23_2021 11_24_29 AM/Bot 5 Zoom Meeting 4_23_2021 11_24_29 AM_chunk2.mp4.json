It's so complicated because then there are, you know, there are these free fatty acid receptors, um, that are located on a lot of different cell types. So that's one way that it can be affecting neurodegeneration or other things in the brain. Um, but also butyrate, for example, is a really potent histone deacetylase inhibitor. So it can be directly influencing gene expression in a number of different cell types like immune cells. I think I have more questions than answers at this point.",

            "transcript": "Also, one thing I like to add is there's been published evidence on the gut microbiome. Not, I mean, this would kind of fall under the indirect stimulation here, but the gut microbiome seems to target the enterochromaffin cells or basically the enteroendocrine, the, you know, the hormone stimulating cells of the epithelial gut lining. So for example, hunger hormones like ghrelin, leptin, and such, those have been found. I don't know if it's in humans, but definitely in mouse that gut microbes somehow stimulate, for example, ghrelin, and then that affects the brain and then it makes the mouse more hungry. That's been shown.",
