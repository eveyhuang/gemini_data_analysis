So we model those types of diseases, and now we're working on achalasia or gastroparesis, similarly lack of proper innervation or transmission. So, you know, motility is blocked.

Because, for example, we've tried growing colonic organoids from aged mice, like 24-month old mice, and they just don't grow because I think they're senescent, themselves just aren't as active anymore. So I was just, I guess, wondering about the how viable it is to try to harvest and grow these enteric organoids from.",
