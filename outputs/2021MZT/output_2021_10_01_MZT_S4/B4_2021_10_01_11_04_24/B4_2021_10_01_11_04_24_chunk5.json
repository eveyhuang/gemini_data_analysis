It's sort of like if you see you're starting a pigs starting to die, then you're like, okay, what's going on there? Should we be sequencing those cases and is there a new virus? Um on the other hand, there's also examples where I can think of where it doesn't cause disease in the natural reservoir, but then when it crosses into humans then there's like um disease. So so um you know, flu is a good example of that too or even the coronaviruses, they don't cause disease in bats. Bats aren't dying from them. But then when it comes to humans then you get a lot of disease. Um whereas there are many other examples where, you know, when you start seeing birds, waterfowl dying and from flu, then that's like a really, really bad thing because normally they infect waterfowl pretty pretty easily, I think.",

So a lot of what we're talking about is like in order to understand this, you need the right data, which if you want to understand the whole system, like if you want to know every virus in every animal in the whole system, that's not feasible. I I will just put that out there. Um so then like so there's has to be some way to target it. So one way people have done it is around disease events and sort of forward tracking, back tracking in disease events, which helps you target things. But that in some ways like from the epidemiologist standpoint, that's really biasing your sample, right? So you're missing all of the things that are going on under the radar when you do that and you tend to be looking at high consequence populations, right? So it has to be pretty big or it has to be humans or livestock mortality or something that that's kind of raising it to that level. Um can we understand the whole system just looking through those ways or are there some things that we could do to understand the system by looking at other strategies of narrowing down what we're looking at.",

Um one of the things that I've been thinking a lot is about I'm not I'm not anywhere close to being expert, but there's this idea of a string theory where there's a lot of data points, but you don't have to understand all the data points, you don't have to actually go sample all the data points. There are certain key parts along that network and that's sufficient to infer then downstream events.",

            "transcript": "Oh, to elaborate a little bit more. So so this this came from an idea here of how we deal with contact tracing in COVID. It flips the idea of contact tracing. So in contact tracing, you have to wait till every individual that's infected then reports back to then say, hey, I'm infected. And then there's a lag time and then someone some contact tracing, some epidemiology team then follows up on that. So what you're in order to figure out of in a population, how many people are infected, that contact tracing approach requires on bottom up. Like everyone has to like every positive has to be identified.",

            "transcript": "In a alternate approach, it is that people who are not infected are as equally informative as people who are infected. And in which case there's some sort of system that then you report, hey, I'm not infected and that tells you, okay, in this cluster, there is low or no infection and then you sort of then fill in the gaps. So a negative data is actually helpful in in filling up this problem of infection and disease rather than the contact tracing approach which is solely based on information of who's positive. And I that's the kind of thing that makes me feel think that when you have a end problem of like a lot of species are being infected with different pathogens rather than sequencing every single one, you know, something like that some reverse approach may be more effective.",

            "transcript": "So I I and I I apologize since I was having so many computer issues, I really missed a lot of the beginning. So uh I'm probably off on a lot of this. But I guess when it comes to reservoirs and stuff like that, um, you know, you're kind of it almost sounds like you're kind of trying to test to see what's there, but how if if we're also talking about emerging pathogens, you know, to some extent you you're going to have to test for stuff that has the potential for going in there. So I'm trying to figure out how this relates to what's been being discussed with reservoirs because I mean, I know a lot of the stuff hasn't been tested, but, you know, take Japanese encephalitis virus or something like that where it's mainly considered, you know, in Japan a little bit in Australia, but, you know, it's spreading a little bit. So when you talk about maybe testing some of the reservoirs, are you would you for to see if it's emerging into like nearby areas, would you start testing those areas for JB although it had it hasn't been ever isolated there to see if there's any reservoir populations or something like that. And then if you are doing it, is it going to expand to other areas just to try to eventually see if it's possible for some of these pathogens to be going into new areas and having reservoirs in new areas just because we don't know, especially with some of the vector born, you know, with um with wildlife and or not wildlife, with livestock, agricultural animals being shipped and stuff like that. I I guess my question is is how do you control for some of the emerging viruses and trying to detect the emerging viruses and stuff like that. Like I said, I missed the full beginning of it, so this may not even be on that topic at all.",
