They go for USDA surveillance programs and I don't know how much information on immunology you can get just out of like little blood spots, but those exist somewhere in USDA.",

Uh but I think there's been work done on on bats uh given that they that they um serve as huge reservoirs of different kinds of viruses. So I I I believe that in in that sense uh knowing the immunology of such animals um where they sort of have a level of inflammation minimal enough to control virus uh replication. I think that's a a key factor that at least in the work that I do we're trying to kind of understand for instance why in the bat there is a innate immunity like type type one interferon or type three interferon highly upregulated than in other uh animals. And so this allows a better control of viral loads in bats that prevents um the animal from getting sick. So I I I think those are are key aspects that we can uh kind of try to understand for for for when spill overs happen and that we can perhaps uh use that as developing of biotherapeutics or antivirals etc. I don't know. Just a a comment.",

There's there's been some nice work that's been done on on bats and and looking at the bat immune system. Um I I I still don't know how to how we use that to inform. Like it's it seems that that's why we might have a lot of viruses, they're very tolerant. Um do you think that might be a characteristic of a of a uh a reservoir host that has potential pathogens that might spill over uh for things other than bats that they can that something about their their immune response allows them to have more diverse pathogens. I I don't know. then then maybe we could use like uh like some of the stuff that's Eron's been doing with NGS sequencing and and viral discovery or pathogen discovery and if we have high diversity make a prediction about the immune tolerance, would that be the word I guess of of or or pathogen tolerance that might be informed for immunity.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I I agree with that. I think that uh it it comes from a concerted like um effort on kind of more diverse surveillance in the wild plus uh next generation sequencing. And I I really like the idea of kind of tolerance versus some sort of like immune response. Uh so in my PhD I did a lot of that with so sheep which are, you know, a wild animal where we're really trying to understand if there were some sort of like environmental cues uh that perhaps would push that spectrum from tolerance all the way to to disease type immune response. Uh and how that might actually change over time depending on uh how well um fed they are if if it was a particularly bad year um or if it's really just a kind of like a coevolution of the parasite and the host that allows them to tolerate but in the event of a of a stochastic jump that just kind of goes awry. Um but I I do agree that uh the sampling is is key uh but the sampling alone does not do it. It it definitely needs to have some sort of like field lab concerted kind of feedback loop collaboration um that makes sense to me. So I know there's a lot of people particularly in Colorado doing trying to do that uh with bats and other and ungulate species. Um so kind of really trying to understand precisely what Justin was highlighting which I do think it's it's key.",

If it's a virus replicating in a host it's it's supposed to be a host, right? So it's um or is it like you don't have a disease then it's a reservoir? I mean I would like to know more about it.

And even if you follow a single subtype, there's usually more diversity of that individual subtype within that host. Uh where so it's a very different type of surveillance.
