Uh even it gets into chickens, you may get a handful of viruses that get into chickens, uh and then potentially getting into humans, but they the diversity is lower every time it jumps into other hosts. So that's how I view a reservoir. That that's the that the diversity of of uh pathogens uh within a single within a single group uh of pathogens would be much higher. Now, if we're doing a community surveillance like this, you might that might be a good way to distinguish between in a wild animal, what is uh what is a reservoir uh what is a what pathogen is it a reservoir for and potentially what is causing a disease in that host.",

And I don't know that that's a universal definition of reservoir, especially not. Yeah, especially not if we get into like bacteria and things. So um so maybe we want to talk a little more about reservoir because that is a kind of crucial concept to zoonotic disease that there's some species that is the reservoir of this and it's spilling out of that species into other species. But I don't know that you can always say that there is like one reservoir species and depending what disease you're talking about, a reservoir could mean a lot of different things or the particular host that spills over to humans might mean different things. Um so I think maybe maybe we might want to focus more around that concept and and it seems like some folks are being really quiet and maybe we're not hitting on the things that you're particularly interested in, but if you have stuff to talk about, feel free to jump in here.",
