            "transcript": "when you get like um H5 getting into chickens, you have very low levels of of diversity. Uh even it gets into chickens, you may get a handful of viruses that get into chickens, uh and then potentially getting into humans, but they the diversity is lower every time it jumps into other hosts. So that's how I view a reservoir. That that's the that the diversity of of uh pathogens uh within a single within a single group uh of pathogens would be much higher. Now, if we're doing a community surveillance like this, you might that might be a good way to distinguish between in a wild animal, what is uh what is a reservoir uh what is a what pathogen is it a reservoir for and potentially what is causing a disease in that host.",
