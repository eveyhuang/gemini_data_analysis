            "transcript": "Um so especially when you talk about these vector born viruses, it does get a little bit more difficult because it's all based off of it can be based off of not only it being in the mosquito, but what species of mosquito and then what is it feeding on, which you know, is it feeding on a sheep versus a pig versus a cow and even those species can change a little bit. So and we do also try to do this a little bit in cells because we do have sheep cells or mosquito cells, um some wildlife cells so we can try to um passage them in cells and you know, one of our goals eventually will be to say, okay, if we passage these in the cells, you know, how much different is it from when we actually passage it in the vectors and the animals because let's face it the cell work is a lot easier, but is it is it going to give us similar results that we see in the actual host and vectors?",

So it's kind of the idea of like there's something else causing this. And so we then use next generation sequencing to just sequence unbiasedly the samples and then look for viral sequences from there. Um then sometimes we find a new virus, sometimes a known virus with a different mutation, that sort of thing.",
