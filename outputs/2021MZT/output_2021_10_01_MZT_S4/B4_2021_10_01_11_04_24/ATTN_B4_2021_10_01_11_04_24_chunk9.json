I so and since it's in writing it must be true. But we did kind of focus on the hierarchical nature of the drivers of spillover. Looking at those from the molecular standpoint, pathogen uh standpoint, the host and the environment. And from the molecular side of things that within host and between host selection pressures that are put on the microbes including selector selection for vector competence. From the pathogen side, the span of host susceptibility of the pathogen, uh identity and pre preadaptation and the environmental persistence that may come with that pathogen. I from the host being human and or other animal, uh the receptors in the host that could be useful to the pathogen, movement of animals including people, host ecology, naive populations, uh reservoir versus uh amplifying host and the capabilities to be either of those.",
