Um but basically and this is a lot from the parasite perspective but not entirely. Uh so so ideally of course, you know, we'd all like to know are there markers out there um for for these parasites that are, you know, are floating around of which there are many that um would allow us to differentiate between um different uh groups of different different hosts that this parasite would be more or less likely to be able to infect.",

And then the ability to actually be spread among a human or livestock population and um the analogy of uh the step one there, the jump being the spark and um the step three being a raging wildfire is something that I'm going to come back to real quickly here. Uh but um in addition, you know, we're just just looking at how would we look at these markers, um some of the unknown questions, some of the things that would have to be addressed is um we don't understand the frequency of these markers and how often they would change in in different reservoir populations.",

Um and um we also brought up the fact that we can find these markers, but if they're in markers populations of reservoirs that never have contact with human and livestock, does it matter. So where as well as what gets samples is going to be very, very important. Um what do we do if we find something uh is has been brought up a lot. Again that relates to what does this ability to identify a predictive marker get us and we think we need to answer that. So is the science or the policy more important here. And then also, you know, maybe looking more at that step two, when we find a marker, you know, under understanding whether um these there's there's an inherent fitness or disadvantage or disadvantage when it comes to adaptation and spread is also going to be crucial and um how would we model the likelihood of this is another outstanding question. So just a lot of questions that we have that we feel we should focus on.",

Uh so a lot of the questions that came at the discussion that came uh in when we were talking about the spillover uh is what are the drivers? What are the drivers that are making uh that these pathogens make the jump. a lot had to do with ecology of the host uh uh and uh also the human involvement. So we were talking about uh animal migration and animal density have how that affects uh this spillover effects. But one thing that uh we also talk about is how is human activities affecting this and one of examples that were discussed in the group was in influenza, how human migration into a certain areas where they are infected wild birds increases the chances of that spillover effect. And how and how we should be putting this human movement into predicting models like uh how do we gather that data? And one possibility is the use of cell phone data uh to monitor uh human movement. Uh why we are developing these uh models to look into uh the prediction of a spill over events. And another thing that was discussed is how can we bridge the skills in ecology? Uh looking at the microhabitats and what happens when a virus is entering into a new host, how is the immune system of the host driving the evolution of the virus so that the virus can now infect humans.",
