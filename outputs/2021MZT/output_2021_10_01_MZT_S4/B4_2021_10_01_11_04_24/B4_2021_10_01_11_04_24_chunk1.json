Uh, if I think about uh wild animal or zoonautic host immunology, I think that's like a dream data set. I just don't know if it exists and I don't know who would have the samples to even generate a preliminary data set for something like that. From the host, uh, I my thoughts are um more about how you actually go forward, right? So that's why I sorry, from the the the potential human host or um uh the the spillover host. There there might be more information at least from human or pigs, maybe some chickens uh and if it goes from a wild reservoir into a domestic animal. Um, sorry, just trying to guide my my own thinking on this and probably speaking aloud and distracting everyone.",
