Because it it it's tougher to catch the animal and and uh and test it. How many mosquitoes can you catch in a trap and pool to screen? I have no idea.",

So like I said, I kind of I might look at it a little bit different. I don't just look at the animals or the mammalian hosts as reservoirs. I also look at at the vectors because when you look at overwintering and stuff like that, it's it's the insects that can play a big role in that not not just the mammalian species.

Um I keep thinking about slide 21 from Christine's talk yesterday where she had the zootic host, the uh domestic animals and then um I guess the disease host and it was it it showed like a wildlife uh wildlife domestic and then then humans um on this this scale uh of essentially of of environmental complexity maybe. But I'm wondering if there's actually a way to develop a lab model system where you had, you know, because a lot of these things like in the environment, this is so complex, there's so many factors that we simply can't control. Is there actually a a potential model system where we say, here's a reservoir host where we can just uh have a reservoir population in a lab, we can manipulate that population, we can characterize that population. We can have a second population that can be infected by it but not necessarily uh sustain the transmission to amplify it. And then another one where maybe it's a cell culture based to say, you know, potentially causing disease. I I I I think like the the challenges in this are just huge to do to to try and understand entirely from observational data uh that we collect through whatever process, either catching mosquitoes, catching animals, uh doing uh environmental sampling. There there's so many factors here that we can't control for. Would anybody have an idea about a a potential experimental system to put into a lab? My mind is kind of drawing towards nematodes, but I actually don't know enough about viruses that affect nematodes.",

Like that they're becoming intrusive everywhere. Should we and and then going back but hold on, we don't know anything about immunity of feral pigs or how even like is it the same is they're not even the same species as a domestic pig.
