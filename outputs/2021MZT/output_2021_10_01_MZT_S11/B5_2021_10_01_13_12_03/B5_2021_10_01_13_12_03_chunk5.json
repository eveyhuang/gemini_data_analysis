They're very conserved different than between the million species and there's they're also fairly conserved in the insects as well. And so we're actually going to try to start looking to see if the virus activates at different times the GTPases or doesn't activate and that is that why we see differences in insects versus the mammal uh the mammalian cells, but we're also looking at the different species of the insects, the different agricultural uh species cell lines that we have as well just because there can be slight differences and we don't know what it is. And right now the virus doesn't actually hasn't been shown to interact with the GTPases. It's just like it binds to the cell and all of a sudden these GTPases can be activated or activated down the line. And so we're just actually looking at the activation now um and or we will be. Um but we're we're kind of going along that line as well. So it's it's it's a totally different area for me. So it was nice to have this person with that expertise come in and try to do it. But once again, that's something that even though it's highly conserved, there might just be slight differences um between the animals and it it is being used for possible treatment for cancer too. So it's not like it's it's not in the realm of having a that being a target for a certain species or something like that.",

Are there any technologies that for these problems or for this in this space would be really uh enabling. And hence could we put those on our reports and other groups might be uh excited about that. Is there anything? I mean we already talked about the difficulty to mine current databases. We already talked about that with respect to anything uh with respect to uh epigenetics of the host uh we often don't have the data uh and and and when we do have the data uh you usually generate it yourself.",

That way or single cell transcriptomics. I think often these epigenetic changes are reflected at the level of the transcript, whether it be by these modifications that Kristen was talking about or just abundance.",
