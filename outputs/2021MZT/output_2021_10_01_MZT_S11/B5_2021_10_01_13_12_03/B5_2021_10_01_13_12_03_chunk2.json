Um so there are some uh strains and lineages within a single a species of a pathogen. So let's just I'll I'll just talk about bacteria. Sing um different lineages and strains of bacterial species that can are more successful in colonizing different range of hosts. So some would be, you know, more host restricted, some would have broad host range, but all of these within a single species. So I would be very interested in to find out more about what are the um uh different um genetic variants that make these different strains, different lineages more successful in certain host species. And I was thinking from the point of view of, you know, looking at positive selection um on each of those different host species. Um and it may be um the presence of certain mutations or the presence of certain accessory genes um that make them more successful in colonizing certain host species and switching to a new host species. So if we uh so DNS looking at positive um negative selection.",

Because if they're more malleable, more prone to mutation presumably, they're more likely to be able to infect a different variety or or category of species. I don't know.",

And then there is always the survival of the fittest and they replicate so robust that you have so many RNA molecules and making different type of viruses and the better ones evolve and then they get transmitted. So uh understanding uh uh you know, different variants appearing will be uh important for this, especially if we are talking about then uh the uh receptor recognition of viruses to like different viruses having mutations occurring like now you everyone knows about SARS virus but it has been happening for flavi viruses and other viruses too. Uh and then they adapt to new um new cell types and they spread. For example, we talk about chicken gunya having a single mutation uh able to adapt to new mosquito species and uh just single amino acid mutation can do that. So um yeah, that's that's my two cents.",

I think it's also a very nice link to that because these modifications are almost exclusively, not entirely exclusively, but almost exclusively being put in by host protein machinery and I just I don't know. I just wanted to let people know about that that's something we're working on and have evidence um for example the SARS RDR RDRP um complex being reconstituted in vitro really seeing massive changes in um in how it functions.

So any enzyme the machinery, right, the mechanism tends to be conserved, but how they target their individual their you know, the the targeting domains tend not to be so well conserved um between different species. So like eukaryotic pseudouridine synthesis species for example have really different um",

So if I if I think about this prompt here, can we identify within pathogens possible drug targets that would prevent spillover. So if I hear you correct, those enzymes that you are referring to could be targets that could prevent spillover if the modification is critical for either uh uh uh amplification of the viral pathogen or or whatever pathogen.",
