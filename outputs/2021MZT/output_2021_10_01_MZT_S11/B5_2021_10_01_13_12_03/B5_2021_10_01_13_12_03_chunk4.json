I didn't I don't know that data. I'm not a entomologist so it's not something I study but it's just one of those things, you know, how they have adapted to the to their differences in environments and to the insecticides or whatever, how does that actually affect the the pathogen replication and transmission and you know, is it enhancing it or is it actually inhibiting it? But that was just like one of the questions that had popped up yesterday as well and it could play a role in, you know, could this be a way for it to jump or for it to be a super spreader or anything like that.",

Um but but if you actually um if if you knew someone's susceptibility to the disease uh genetically such that, you know, maybe that person would actually foster more mutations because of um the way their immune system responded, shouldn't you actually be focusing on on treating those individuals faster um um and and you know, could you detect that? I I just haven't heard of of programs like that but but maybe they they do exist.",

I have a feeling that in the next year we're going to find out a lot of uh data that hasn't been accumulated in the past year and that people are now looking at from actually infection with with COVID. Uh but I think those studies are hard and and probably lengthy is my guess. Uh but I know we were talking yesterday in the reception a little bit. Here at Illinois, we started doing testing of all the students and all the staff twice a week mandatory last summer. And so that means that there is a whole year of data of about 53,000 people that were all tested twice a week. I I hope because all of that data is there that uh that this will be mined for all kinds of different uh uh uh parameters. Um I don't know if we will have enough data of the people that tested positive and if we have all of that information on host, host immunity, transcriptomics, uh epigenetics, my guess is probably not. but but if the samples were frozen, uh maybe, maybe we can go back and can do a lot of analyses of these positive cases. And of course, patient wide and globally, there's a lot of samples that can be looked at retrospectively for things we don't know. And so maybe making a list of what would be good things to look at that either people are already looking at or perhaps not because we don't know what other people are doing. That could be a very valuable uh way of using resources that are already perhaps out there.",

            "transcript": "if you have a host human or otherwise uh that that is more susceptible uh to to one let's say virus, um does that automatically tell you that there are features that will make them more susceptible to another? Um in in other words if you if you drug specifically or or treated specifically um for one susceptibility, how much of that actually translates to to others or would you have to, you know, get in the weeds and the details of of exactly which pathogen you're talking about. Yeah, yeah, like uh I think uh I I work on toxoplasma trying to look at how their host is is uh susceptible or resistant. Uh one thing I can tell you toxoplasma is an intracellular pathogen. So the mechanism that the host uses to counteract it is kind of uh similar to all intracellular pathogens, not just parasites, but uh is also quite related to the mechanisms that the host will use against tuberculosis for example, which is intracellular. Like all pathogens that go into the cell and form a vacu around them are attacked pretty much in the same way by the host. So it's basically dependent on how does the pathogen invade the host and how does it uh protect itself from the host. So if if it those path if a group of pathogens that are completely different but they have similar characteristics, the host do have pretty much the same mechanism of attacking whether it's a virus, bacteria or a parasite or whatever it is.",

That's actually cool system to look for. Like we know that methylation is important for some of these viruses and then their packaging etc.",
