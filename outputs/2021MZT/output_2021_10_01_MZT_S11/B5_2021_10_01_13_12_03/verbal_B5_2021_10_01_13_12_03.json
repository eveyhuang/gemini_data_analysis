        "utterance": "William Witola: So I I I can try and respond to that. So sometime back we did a study on toxoplasma. Uh this is a parasite that infects almost all warm blooded animals including human beings. So what we found was let me just go back a little bit. So the study was we selected two kinds of individuals, those that develop a severe infection after being infected while in utero. That's when they are babies in the womb. So if they are infected during that time, they are born with severe infection like brain damage, eye damage and often, you know, they don't live long. Then there are those who get infected while in the womb, but you know, they are born normally, but they have a parasite. It doesn't cause any damage. So what we did then, we observed where there was generational differences. So we followed up individuals who when they were born, they had the disease, but they had no specific symptoms or pathology and then they went on to have children and those children also were born infected and they had no pathology. The other way we followed up individuals who were born and they had some kind of pathology, either eye damage or brain damage, but they survived, grew up and went on to have children who also got infected and you know, they developed pathology. So what we did on we found two specific genes are called nap one and let me talk about nap one a little bit. So nap one is a gene that is involved in the formation of what are called inflammasome. So these are important for innate immune responses that, you know, activate the expression of cytokines, for example, that are involved in prevention of actual establishment of infection. We found that there were actually just small single mutations within the gene, you know, not so many. Just those simple mutations would, you know, kind of confer resistance or susceptibility to the parasite, which I think is all related to genetics of the host. But on the other hand, we did also a study using two right models, one that is completely resistant to toxoplasma, the other one that's susceptible, you know, once it's infected, it will eventually die from the infection. While the other one would get infected and within probably a few hours clear the infection completely, you won't ever see the parasite in the system. So what we found was there was a way that that rat that is susceptible, you know, kind of differs from the one that's resistant in that there are some molecules that the resistant rat over expresses and those molecules are involved in clearance of the parasite. So what that tells us probably there could be something to do with epigenetics, you know, that relates to expression or activation of expression of genes or something to do with activity of promoters and so on and so forth. So when we look at the sequences of those genes that were either over expressed or under expressed in the resistant and susceptible mouse rat rather respectively, we found that there was particularly no difference in the sequence of the gene. What we don't know is what is on the promoter and what's activating the expression of the genes in the resistant rat. So quite clearly, there is something at play in the way the host responds to infection vis-a-vis genetics or epigenetics, which will determine whether the host to be susceptible or not susceptible or whether you see pathology or you don't see pathology.

You know, there's very few changes between something like Reston and a little and a more virulent one and they've tried to make all these changes and they haven't been able to associate it with uh the differences in pathogenesis that they see. So I do agree with William that with that it's probably a lot of the host and the epigenetics and just the genetics can play an important role. Um, but you know with West Nile as it passed through the United States and have changed and even now with SARS CO2, um, you know, they they see the changes in the mutants, they're doing the sequencing and they're they're trying to correlate it to other stuff, but um, so for me it it can be very dependent, but it's a very difficult aspect to determine. Um, sometimes like I said with Ebola, I know they've been trying to do it for years and it just they just haven't been able to figure out the actual genetics because that I mean that was one goal that some people were having was to try and predict future outbreaks especially after the big 2013 one.
