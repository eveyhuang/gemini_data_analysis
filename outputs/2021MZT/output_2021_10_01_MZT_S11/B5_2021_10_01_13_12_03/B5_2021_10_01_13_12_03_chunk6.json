And it seems like uh based on their evolutionary history seems like one of them have been acquired somewhere else and that can and and you know, that could be a potential target where um target for antimicrobials for example, where um okay, it's been a while. Um the antimicrobials can target the bacterial version um of those synthetases without affecting the synthetases of the human host for example.

I guess maybe thing I one thing I'd be curious about is um this would be hard to study but it from what I'm hearing it seems like the pathogen jumps to a human host and it's has to adapt within that human host and then and then it can spread more widely. And so I'd be really interested in knowing if those initial human hosts where the pathogen jumps, are they what is their immune response like? Is it that they are slightly worse at controlling it and that gives it an opportunity to mutate and adapt or is it or is it that the mutations were already there that allowed it to go into that host and do well. So I mean what what how much of this is the pathogen's mutations and how much of it is the host's immune response.",

I know they're working on things like that. But you know, is would if we use something like that like the polyphenols or anything like that, would it be more broad based target where they're actually attacking more of like the transcription of viruses or something that's needed to actually that's applied to a lot of the RNA viruses. So it's more RNA virus based versus DNA virus based, something like that. So like a more broad based novel intervention that yeah up in the sky type of thing.",
