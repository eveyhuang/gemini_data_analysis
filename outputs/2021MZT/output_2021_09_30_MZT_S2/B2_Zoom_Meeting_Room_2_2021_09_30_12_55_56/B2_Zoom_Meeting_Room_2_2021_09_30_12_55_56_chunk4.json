And so they're in they're up close pen, they're getting ready to calf out. They're going to be over here. Once they calf out, they're going to the calf is going to go into this pen and the animal is going to go into that pen. At very well regulated dairies, yes, they do have that information. Um and they do track it, but if they don't keep solid records, which is sometimes hard to find, um you can't trace it within the farm.",

Um and the whole point of that work was to get to that understanding. Um yeah. So it is it's definitely possible and um could be really, really cheap. It could be maybe, you know, if it's needed, maybe that's something we propose um I have a lot of things written up on it.
