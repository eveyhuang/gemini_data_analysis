We can pick that up now on our radar systems. And so that's I think a really promising area for making larger scale forecasts than we could based on the idea of, you know, let's put lightweight tags on every single bird or bat or something that we can.",

And I wish there was a way that we could track individual animals based on the blood meals in these mosquitoes because I think, I know like in the Everglades, they've done this where they've detected the presence of certain critters that they're looking for because they're looking at these blood meals and it helps them to monitor the populations that are present. So, I mean, I think there is a possibility with using blood engorged insects to do some degree of monitoring, but I don't know how useful that is for small scale movement.",

Um, and I was part at some point of a group called Rapid, you know, research and policy in infectious disease dynamics and we talked a lot about movement. And we came up with, you know, a big limitation which is we don't even have open access data to really mine and and come up with these general patterns that might be there that could help you understand um some of the phenomena on on scalability, different animals or even humans, you know, which is what we were working on. Um, so I agree with this the big challenge is how can you translate from individual studies and and and settings to a trend of mobility, exposure and and I guess emergence. Um, and there are good studies. We did work with uh dogs in Tanzania trying to understand how SIV is jumping from domestic animals to chimpanzees. So we had to individually track all the dogs and see that they had common areas in the, you know, crop area next to the park where the chimpanzees are going and the dogs are meeting. So maybe it's not that much individual animals, but it's patterns that lead you to areas where these encounters occur and that's what really you should care about, you know, more than the individual tracks.",
