            "transcript": "of the caribou in Northern Canada, they found that insect populations actually drive these caribou migrations. You know, insect pressure can drive animals to move quite a bit. And then you're not just talking about the insects because then you also have to consider all of the factors that go into where those insects are at and why they're at the populations that they're at that are driving those movements. So you get many layers deep in the complexity of what's driving movement patterns in these different groups and I I feel like it's going to be very challenging to do a broad generalization on that.",

Um so I think there's some some big generality there that you can then sort of you know add whatever complexity you need to. Um but it's kind of a nice a nice starting point I guess.",

But even with migration, I will say that uh I mean it's very what's driving the actual migration or the factor that are determining the timing of that migration is could be very system and even like within ungulate species will be fairly can be fairly different. So uh yes, I think this I I still struggle to see like if we want to move toward generalize I think the only way we can move towards more generalizable models like for movement is to we need to move away from like specific kind of environmental co areas and more moving towards like more like first principles like well every animal move well most of them move in response to foraging but what is foraging for them is very different depending on the system you deal like what system you're dealing with. So it's somehow we still need to we can make them general generalizable but we still need to have that system specific insights before being able to get at that to an extent.",

Um but then there's particular aspects of movement patterns that are more relevant to disease than others. So you know, thinking about contact being the most the most obvious, but it also could be like time spent in a foraging patch that gains some sort of uh nutrient level that change susceptibility. So there's these different dimensions of movement too um that might be more important when we think about how do they influence disease and kind of wondering if those aspects are also generalizable rather than maybe other movement motifs that may might not be as important for um transmission or something along those lines.",

You know, what does that mean for contact patterns between individuals when we think about movement. Um and so if you think about your like your simplest situation where you have individuals are sort of moving randomly in some area, we have a very predictable contact pattern that emerges from that. Um but we sort of we sort of realize that in some cases that's not how animals are actually moving. And so what what do those what do those contact patterns actually look like and how do they link back to movement? I guess that's kind of what I was saying.",

So I wonder if it's possible that um that, you know, just just the the mechanisms that underpin specific kinds of interactions that are say or specific kinds of kinds of movement that are salient to disease should be it might be useful to focus more on those as opposed to like movement writ large, you know, because I'm not sure if we need all of movement to understand the salient portions for disease. We might. But I but I don't know.",

We take these hosts, we don't, you know, like when I work on megafauna, right? So we catch an animal, we get one cross-sectional sample, we can we are not calibrated to forecast disease dynamics well or or internal state well within the animal. And so we don't know how susceptibility is varying. So I think that in my mind at least, the information gap surrounding where everyone else is and what's actually happening in the animal seem like way bigger um obstacles than improved remote sensing.
