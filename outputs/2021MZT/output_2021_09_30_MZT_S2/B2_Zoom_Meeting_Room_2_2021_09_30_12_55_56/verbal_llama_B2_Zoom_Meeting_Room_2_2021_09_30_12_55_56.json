So uh yes, I think this I I still struggle to see like if we want to move toward generalize I think the only way we can move towards more generalizable models like for movement is to we need to move away from like specific kind of environmental co areas and more moving towards like more like first principles like well every animal move well most of them move in response to foraging but what is foraging for them is very different depending on the system you deal like what system you're dealing with.

Um, you know, potentially there's value even in, you know, doing more of those tracking individual animals uh, you know, over time in terms of uh, you know, maybe infection by various pathogens.

Um, often, you know, the specific characteristics of that will not extrapolate to other areas, but I think there's a big potential for gaining a better understanding of important mechanisms that are, you know, that are often broadly more important beyond an individual system. the other thing I I kind of hear everyone kind of also sort of maybe almost using that as a reference point but stretching toward this idea, you know, toward the the fuzzier picture of you know, what types of data, what framework do we need for a you know, maybe something in the context of much larger scale continental to global surveillance.
