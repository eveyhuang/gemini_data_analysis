I mean, we're relatively known for a while from some of these big data synthesis that and wildlife movement becomes definitely slightly more sedentary and aggregated in sort of human environments anyway, right? So, if we're thinking about areas where where wildlife have the most contact with people then you might see sort of I don't know about equivalent densities but equivalent kind of you know strengths of interaction or opportunities for cross species exposure um in more you know urban or agricultural areas whether it's wildlife or livestock.",

You know, I I I still very much hear the in terms of scales, you know, ideas coming from a variety of different directions. So, you know, there's a sense that at the you know, in terms of doing the more you know, localized and detailed measurements, that's often limited by, you know, resources, expense. But, you know, I I think I've heard a couple of examples of where we have newer inexpensive technologies that could help to maybe facilitate more of these study types of studies or local monitoring or increase the uh, you know, the volume of data. And, you know, then again on that on that upper end the, you know, talking about things like, you know, animal density. Are there, you know, sort of conceptual frameworks and abstractions that we can use to uh, you know, to extend some of these monitoring ideas over broader areas. I I think the other one that was brought up was the idea of looking at change. The fact that, well, maybe from a disease emergence standpoint, it's being able to detect where we're seeing a, you know, some type of a disturbance or a perturbation that's leading to a, you know, a shift in these contact patterns that uh, you know, could could provide the impetus for spillover events. So I I mean I I'm just kind of so I I guess I hear kind of the extremes but maybe not so much about the middle and making the connections between them.",

            "transcript": "I don't think this quite answers that question. Um that's a really good question. Um I I think one of the challenges with that is sort of how you partition your scales. So if you kind of imagine it where you have, you know, a bunch of like like nodes on the landscape. Maybe they're farms um or ponds or something that's very discreet where you can say, well, we have something happening within these within this farm. Um but then we might not necessarily know what's happening within that farm or maybe we don't care all that much about find the details what's happening within that farm. But understanding the connectivity between those nodes is something that would be slightly more feasible. Um both from obviously from a farm standpoint that's very feasible because you know what cow is moving from farm A to farm B. But then also in wildlife if you if you have a population that's structured like that more of a kind of standard metapopulation, um you can use, you know, potentially genetic tools where you only need to sample a few individuals to understand something about connectivity between those nodes.",
