Um, often, you know, the specific characteristics of that will not extrapolate to other areas, but I think there's a big potential for gaining a better understanding of important mechanisms that are, you know, that are often broadly more important beyond an individual system. the other thing I I kind of hear everyone kind of also sort of maybe almost using that as a reference point but stretching toward this idea, you know, toward the the fuzzier picture of you know, what types of data, what framework do we need for a you know, maybe something in the context of much larger scale continental to global surveillance.
