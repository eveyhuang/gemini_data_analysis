So malaria is part of the AP complexans, but in my lab we use toxoplasma gondi, which is think about as a model for AP complexan biology because it's really hard to work with plasmodium as some of you might know that. So, uh, we use that to understand conserve aspects of the AP complexan biology using molecular biology techniques and we are especially um interested in understanding how the parasites adapt to all the different environments that they encounter and how the mitochondria adapt to the mosquito stage versus the liver stage in plasmodium for example and in toxoplasma which can infect virtually any cell with a nucleus in your body and in any other warm blooded animal. So how do they adapt to being in maybe a um um muscle cell or a neuron or anything else. So yeah, next to me is Sarah.",

Uh, I did most of my work most of my training when when I when I move to when I move from from uh algae, uh I did most of my training in uh Trapanosoma Cruzi. Uh, but uh uh the fact is when I join when I when I got my own lab, I wanted to extend what we knew about T Bruci um gene expression and metabolism and just especially mitochondrial metabolism and find out you know, how conserved what we understand about those processes and those mechanisms in Bruci is conserved um in the other Trapanosome some of which also cause disease. Uh, and so I um, I started my lab then with T Cruzi and uh still have a little Bruci but then also I'm starting to incorporate into the lab um some of the Trapanosomes that um stay in insects and don't necessarily cause human infections and um try and try again, try and see um what's what's the same and and what's different. Uh, and then about a year or two ago, I got together with some people through a National Science Foundation initiative at you know, integrating biology and became really interested also in the um kind of nexus between energy and information. You know, so you you have energy and you have information and and what connects those two and how how um I guess uh you get a flow between those uh really establishes uh what is possible for an organism and what's actually utilized because you have limitations in both of those. And so um, so I kind of want to try and understand some of what I'm doing in this bigger context as well as, you know, at that discrete molecular level. But a lot of what my lab does day to day is very discrete molecular biology yet. Okay, sorry, Pilar is right under me.",

So if you have uh identified the parasite that is jumped from one host to another and then establishes infection successfully, causes disease, then it it means that that particular marker you're looking at is something to do with how the parasite invades the host and the immune response in order for it to establish infection. And then the other aspect is probably how the parasite then goes on to uh enter tissues and uh, you know, start the pathology. I mean, for the parasite to be able to do all that, then it means it has some molecular mechanisms it uses to avoid being destroyed by the host. Naturally, the host has its own innate molecules that it activates uh right upon being infected by a parasite. That's before the actual adaptive immunity kicks in. So that innate immune responses are the ones that are responsible for stopping parasites from affecting certain hosts and then parasites will be able to infect other hosts based on how they interact with the host at that level. So perhaps this is a classical example of looking at how parasite molecules interact with the host and how the host molecules try to stop the parasite and vice versa.",

So if these markers are very low in in the more um central for I'm simplifying it, but like in the central forest area, but they're more that they're higher in this in between area and maybe they're decreasing the further away from human contact, then that to me would suggest that there's some kind of fitness cost in the animal reservoir at least because it's not selected for it. It's not maintained, so you're going to lose it with the more um transmission is going on, right? And the same for the human transect, I suppose.",

I'm not saying it doesn't happen because it does. Um, but it's not the main uh pathway for spillover events to happen. So I think we should be thinking more about uh domestic animals, uh for example, dogs as indirect spillover pathways that can act as bridges between um more wild animals and and the domestic or pre domestic transmission at the interface or um those like animal like domestic animals that are used for I don't know, poultry or um uh pigs or cattle or animals that are might be at that interface. So maybe just focusing on that population and characterize that population and maybe the relationship with uh the actual the the wild animals because otherwise if they will never overlap, like you can find something that can remotely or like I'm not saying never, but if you you have a parasite that has a marker that has a potential to spill over, but it's in very low frequency in in a selvatic environment and they never or very rarely overlap with any domestic animals or even humans, you keep adding like independent probabilities.",

Then once you do that, then you have to proceed to the next stage, you get into the car, start it and you know. So if you can't open the door, then you can't drive it, right? So maybe that marker will be at the stage of only making the parasite open the door and get into the host. Then other markers will come in at a later stage. Yeah, so I I would think uh there are a lot of things involved, but what marker makes the parasite first get into the host perhaps would be more important if you're looking at uh you know, the pathogenicity of",

But they're going to need as William is saying, they're going to need to have that first mutation to for instance, be able to bind to a surface protein on a a human cell, right? Like on a membrane cell for instance. So that first that first mutation or a couple of mutations are going to be necessary to be able to infect humans and that's the marker I guess that we're talking about. But then once they they transmit in humans, that's when, I mean, then that's when selection is going to happen on those variants because they're spewing out mutations left and right, right? So those variations that make for a better, more efficient transmission are the ones that are going to transmit more. So now you're going to see more of those variations. I mean, SARS COV 2 is the prime example of this, right? Where we see continuous overturn of new variants and the initial like quote unquote Wuhan variants is extinct, doesn't exist anymore. But it it was very fit initially when it jumped into humans, but then new mutations came and they those took over and then we had the epsilon variant and you know, that did really well and then the alpha variant came and that sort of took everything over and now we have the Delta variant. So there is a continuous change and adapt adaptations to just there's always going to be selection for those variants that are more um capable of transmitting or evading our immune system, which might be the same or might not be the same.",

But um DTU 5 and DTU 6 circulating in the domestic environment, but you do see um a very like a different frequency of DTUs depending where we're talking humans or dogs, even within the same um domestic cycle and the same environment. So I don't know, there there's also that selection and when you go and look at the triatomines, you see a higher frequency of like most DTUs circulating in triatomines, but there's different tropism in the animals so you detect them differently and there is selection obviously there. And and even though we're talking about both hosts participating and perpetuating the transmission cycle. So that to me is fascinating.",
