      "transcript": "that I'm proposing is to have and I think yesterday we we discussed with Jenny actually to have like a like at least general picture, first picture of the what we have in bats, what we have in white mammals and what are in terms of the of the as soon as we have this this genetic market and how we can uh um we have uh in three months, six months, how is the the variation and if the bat that was initially in the bat we can now start observing in raccoons and these raccoons are very very close to humans, right? So how this the triatomine, the insect vector can start transmitting this new variant to humans. So the idea is check, we need to do this population based surveillance genetic, no? to see how is the variation.",

      "transcript": "Well, the thing I'm thinking of is is what is the fitness of these different mutations, right? In different hosts. So can we can we expect a high frequency of an adaptation that would make it a highly transmissible human pathogen already existence in the other host species, right? Like the reservoir host species. And I'm sure there's some examples where it is and I can I would imagine that in many examples it would also not be, right? Because the pathogen that's going to jump might be adapting in the human population quite quickly in those first couple of transmission events.",

So it depends on how quickly it adapts, but I guess what is the selective pressure in the in the animal species to have that high frequency of having of having these mutations that would make it very having a high fitness in humans, right?
