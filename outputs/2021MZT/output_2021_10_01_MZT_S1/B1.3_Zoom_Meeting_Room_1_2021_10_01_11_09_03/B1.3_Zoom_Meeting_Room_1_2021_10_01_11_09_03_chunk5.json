I'm not saying they don't happen because obviously, but it's just like how much are we going to invest on that type of surveillance and neglecting maybe other type of surveillance that might be giving you maybe yes, you're missing those rare events that might happen with some frequency. Um, but is what are we trying to anticipate all possible events? Are we trying to anticipate maybe we can't anticipate everything that's going to emerge. But if we detected early, so it's like what are we trying to do? What's the objective? Like detected early, anticipate or like prevent it to happen it all together. Because what what happens now and let's say let let's say we have a marker that predicts that it's going to be a jump into humans. What happens if we find it? Then what? What do we do?",

Sorry to bring like another perspective that hasn't like it's not really had to do with the like the discussion here, but it it's it might guide is like okay, so what? What do we what if we find this this marker? How is it going to be used?",

And the first is the actual jump, which I think is also yeah, as you're saying, it's most stochastic, right? And then what's happening is the adaptation within those first couple of individuals of adapting to humans. And I guess the third process is then that's going to spread, right?",

And the first would be, can we prevent the actual initial jump, right? The second would be, can we detect those first adaptations in the first human individuals and well, detect and then obviously do something about it. And then the third is try and just reduce massive spread, which is where we're now in in COVID, right? Um, so the last one is definitely not the right option.",

For example, if you're going to drive to work, the first stage is for you to open the door for the car. Then once you do that, then you have to proceed to the next stage, you get into the car, start it and you know. So if you can't open the door, then you can't drive it, right? So maybe that marker will be at the stage of only making the parasite open the door and get into the host. Then other markers will come in at a later stage. Yeah, so I I would think uh there are a lot of things involved, but what marker makes the parasite first get into the host perhaps would be more important if you're looking at uh you know, the pathogenicity of",
