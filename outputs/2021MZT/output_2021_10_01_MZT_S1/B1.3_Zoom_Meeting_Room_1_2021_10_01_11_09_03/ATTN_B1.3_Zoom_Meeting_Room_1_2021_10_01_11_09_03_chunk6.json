   "transcript": "Right. I mean, the way I see it is that there's there's just ongoing evolution, right? Like nothing is, okay, one step and then we're done. Now we can infect humans. But they're going to need as William is saying, they're going to need to have that first mutation to for instance, be able to bind to a surface protein on a a human cell, right? Like on a membrane cell for instance. So that first that first mutation or a couple of mutations are going to be necessary to be able to infect humans and that's the marker I guess that we're talking about. But then once they they transmit in humans, that's when, I mean, then that's when selection is going to happen on those variants because they're spewing out mutations left and right, right? So those variations that make for a better, more efficient transmission are the ones that are going to transmit more. So now you're going to see more of those variations. I mean, SARS COV 2 is the prime example of this, right? Where we see continuous overturn of new variants and the initial like quote unquote Wuhan variants is extinct, doesn't exist anymore. But it it was very fit initially when it jumped into humans, but then new mutations came and they those took over and then we had the epsilon variant and you know, that did really well and then the alpha variant came and that sort of took everything over and now we have the Delta variant. So there is a continuous change and adapt adaptations to just there's always going to be selection for those variants that are more um capable of transmitting or evading our immune system, which might be the same or might not be the same.",

Like so if you're if you're in a wild population of animals that um is very different situation than being in a single breed of domestic cattle or pigs or chickens which have been selectively bred to be as homogeneous as possible. So I I think that that might be an an element there that we haven't thought about that I",

   "transcript": "Uh no, no, I was going to say like going back to that, um to me it's always been really interesting for example in South America uh with Tripanosoma cruzi we had like the DTUs and we have for example in the domestic environments, um you can think about different lineages. But um DTU 5 and DTU 6 circulating in the domestic environment, but you do see um a very like a different frequency of DTUs depending where we're talking humans or dogs, even within the same um domestic cycle and the same environment. So I don't know, there there's also that selection and when you go and look at the triatomines, you see a higher frequency of like most DTUs circulating in triatomines, but there's different tropism in the animals so you detect them differently and there is selection obviously there. And and even though we're talking about both hosts participating and perpetuating the transmission cycle. So that to me is fascinating.",
