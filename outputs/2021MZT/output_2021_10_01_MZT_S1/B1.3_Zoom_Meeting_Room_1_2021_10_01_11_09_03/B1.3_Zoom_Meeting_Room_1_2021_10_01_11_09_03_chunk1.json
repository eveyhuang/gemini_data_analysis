            "transcript": "Hey everyone. Um, I'm also an assistant professor at University of Georgia, started the lab two years ago and I work on AP complexans. So malaria is part of the AP complexans, but in my lab we use toxoplasma gondi, which is think about as a model for AP complexan biology because it's really hard to work with plasmodium as some of you might know that. So, uh, we use that to understand conserve aspects of the AP complexan biology using molecular biology techniques and we are especially um interested in understanding how the parasites adapt to all the different environments that they encounter and how the mitochondria adapt to the mosquito stage versus the liver stage in plasmodium for example and in toxoplasma which can infect virtually any cell with a nucleus in your body and in any other warm blooded animal. So how do they adapt to being in maybe a um um muscle cell or a neuron or anything else. So yeah, next to me is Sarah.",

Uh, I did most of my work most of my training when when I when I move to when I move from from uh algae, uh I did most of my training in uh Trapanosoma Cruzi. Uh, but uh uh the fact is when I join when I when I got my own lab, I wanted to extend what we knew about T Bruci um gene expression and metabolism and just especially mitochondrial metabolism and find out you know, how conserved what we understand about those processes and those mechanisms in Bruci is conserved um in the other Trapanosome some of which also cause disease. Uh, and so I um, I started my lab then with T Cruzi and uh still have a little Bruci but then also I'm starting to incorporate into the lab um some of the Trapanosomes that um stay in insects and don't necessarily cause human infections and um try and try again, try and see um what's what's the same and and what's different. Uh, and then about a year or two ago, I got together with some people through a National Science Foundation initiative at you know, integrating biology and became really interested also in the um kind of nexus between energy and information. You know, so you you have energy and you have information and and what connects those two and how how um I guess uh you get a flow between those uh really establishes uh what is possible for an organism and what's actually utilized because you have limitations in both of those. And so um, so I kind of want to try and understand some of what I'm doing in this bigger context as well as, you know, at that discrete molecular level. But a lot of what my lab does day to day is very discrete molecular biology yet. Okay, sorry, Pilar is right under me.",

Um, I'm a disease ecologist. I'm a new assistant professor at Washington State University. I work on socioecological systems and particularly on vector born diseases. So I work on Chagas disease and tick born diseases in particular in South America and the in the United States. Um, and just trying to understand the the feedbacks and the interactions between the human dimension, so incorporating the the social context and the behavioral components um that people create uh and how that interacts with the ecological processes that determine um the disease risk. So, yeah, I'm kind of on the other side. I think like at least at the population level or even at a community level. So the different scale. Um, oh, I'm sorry. Below me is Sylvie.

Uh, and we have also the lines of plasma and malaria. Uh, this is the the the new line in in the lab, but mainly in in in Chagas disease. So we work on um trying to understand all the molecular epidemiology from the different cycle, epidemiological cycle, wild and domestic and how uh these differences between uh Trapanosoma DTUs for example or genotypes can be affected in the are different in in the different animals and how this can be affected in humans. So we are measuring the the risk of of of humans um disease and now uh we are doing uh metagenomic analysis working with next generation sequencing uh working with the whole genome of the detecting new markers for uh to improve to improve diagnostic for for uh Chagas disease in humans and and we also developing a new um diagnostic test of for dogs as sentinel for Trapanosoma Cruzi. Um, so uh in in general working with with metagenomics and genomics and next generation sequencing understand the whole picture of Chagas disease.",

So in the case of uh toxoplasma, I'm interested in uh, you know, um identifying innate immune responses that are important in eliminating the parasite. And uh that's one of the aspects that um on for. So with this regard, I have uh identified some special molecules within the animal host that when they are upregulated, they tend to activate the elimination of the intracellular parasite. And so I'm interested in uh you know, cloning those uh motives that are important in these molecules and then uh introducing them into infected host and see if they can be used as biologic uh therapeutics for eliminating the infection. Then in the case of uh cryptosporidium, I have been working on identifying uh molecular drug targets. So I um identify enzymes that are essential for the parasite and then develop asses that I can use to screen uh small molecule libraries to identify specific inhibitors for those and then test them for efficacy against the parasite.",
