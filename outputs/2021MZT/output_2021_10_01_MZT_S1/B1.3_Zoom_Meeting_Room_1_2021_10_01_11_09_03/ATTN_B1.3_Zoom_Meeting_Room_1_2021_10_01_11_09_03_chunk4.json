And that doesn't often spill over or or it's not really a fit in the in the animal population and therefore it's just a very low frequencies. Um then it that's going to make a difference on whether it's relevant, right? If it has a high fitness for both the animal population and the human population, so so you're going to get very frequent jumps. Vice versa, right? From humans to animals and animals back to humans, so they're a reservoir. That's where you really need to uh worry. So I mean, I would argue with this kind of work that it's it's important to identify these markers, but also to to to assess and to measure what the the level of fitness is of the different variants that you have.",

      "transcript": "So so can I just jump in the middle here? So um what we are trying to lead to right now, I think is looking at how the host responds to the parasite. So if you have uh identified the parasite that is jumped from one host to another and then establishes infection successfully, causes disease, then it it means that that particular marker you're looking at is something to do with how the parasite invades the host and the immune response in order for it to establish infection. And then the other aspect is probably how the parasite then goes on to uh enter tissues and uh, you know, start the pathology. I mean, for the parasite to be able to do all that, then it means it has some molecular mechanisms it uses to avoid being destroyed by the host. Naturally, the host has its own innate molecules that it activates uh right upon being infected by a parasite. That's before the actual adaptive immunity kicks in. So that innate immune responses are the ones that are responsible for stopping parasites from affecting certain hosts and then parasites will be able to infect other hosts based on how they interact with the host at that level. So perhaps this is a classical example of looking at how parasite molecules interact with the host and how the host molecules try to stop the parasite and vice versa.",

So if you can sample the animal population in the middle of the forest where there's limited human um human to animal transmission and then at the at the sort of um border zone and then, you know, a little bit further away individuals that don't have a lot of animal contact and then see what is the frequency of these um different markers, then you can make at least some inference on what is what is their fitness, right? So if these markers are very low in in the more um central for I'm simplifying it, but like in the central forest area, but they're more that they're higher in this in between area and maybe they're decreasing the further away from human contact, then that to me would suggest that there's some kind of fitness cost in the animal reservoir at least because it's not selected for it. It's not maintained, so you're going to lose it with the more um transmission is going on, right? And the same for the human transect, I suppose.",

Um, it's actually the intermediary host. And what I mean is like selvatic hosts that are completely isolated and they have the selvatic transmission cycle interacting with human. I'm not saying it doesn't happen because it does. Um, but it's not the main uh pathway for spillover events to happen. So I think we should be thinking more about uh domestic animals, uh for example, dogs as indirect spillover pathways that can act as bridges between um more wild animals and and the domestic or pre domestic transmission at the interface or um those like animal like domestic animals that are used for I don't know, poultry or um uh pigs or cattle or animals that are might be at that interface. So maybe just focusing on that population and characterize that population and maybe the relationship with uh the actual the the wild animals because otherwise if they will never overlap, like you can find something that can remotely or like I'm not saying never, but if you you have a parasite that has a marker that has a potential to spill over, but it's in very low frequency in in a selvatic environment and they never or very rarely overlap with any domestic animals or even humans, you keep adding like independent probabilities.",
