Um, I've been spending a lot of time um basing basically evolutionary models on on biophysical characteristics uh that that one can compute. Um, my broader interest and and Angad basically hit it experimentally is is trying to actually create um models that that would actually predict how evolution would proceed on different viruses and how they would change. And the key issue and this is where it connects to his is um we have terrible models of what's going on in the cells. Um, you know, one I I can I can give you binding affinities also wazu to screen compounds, but I can tell you that half of that is meaningless. Um, you know, yes, it could bind in this in this very clean setup, but then is it is it down regulated? Are other proteins expressed? What what is going on? Um, and I really think we need more work that is cross theoretical and and experimental there where we we do actually have genotypic platforms where we can quickly come up with models and design models so that we can do some some level of prediction rapidly. Um, so so I think that's very important. Um, from the prompt, um, I guess I'm most interested in in the notion of of uh, you know, how do you prevent jumping? Uh, you know, can can you think of uh, for example, differences in binding to different glyco proteins um on cell surfaces um that differentiate different species that one can then target. Um, you know, from the theoretical perspective, it's hard to model glyco proteins, it's still a challenge. Um, but but maybe that's that's one place where where people could could jump. ",

So this class of parasites called complexans. And we use in my lab uh model like a cousin of malaria, it's called Toxoplasma gondi as a as a yeast model for these very divergent organisms. And just thinking about the the prompts that we got and one of them is uh can one target genes that allow cross species infections so as to target pathogens in humans or hosts or limiting jumping events. Uh someone in my lab kind of like is trying to do that at least with my parasite and that I don't know if that can be applied to broader a broader approach but basically we use CRISPR to basically infect cells this you use your pathogen of interest and you infect cells of different hosts, let's say humans, bats, you name it. And then you those cells need to be crispered so those cells need to have uh need to lack certain genes because you basically you prepare them as a library and then you you infect them and then you just look at which ones did infect, which ones did not. And that way you can realize, okay, gene X was missing from these cells, so therefore gene X is used for entry in these cells and so on and so forth. So that's also that's that's something that the CRISPR biology just open up for us. Um, so I think that's something that's pretty pretty feasible. ",

So um that kind of relates to one of the prompts um where they say are there biologics uh that can be easily reprogrammed with common delivery platform. So what we've seen is these small GTPs are kind of highly conserved among all mammalian species and the active motif is pretty much the same in all mammals.

You know, once uh so if you have a population of these parasites when they get into the host, uh a large number of them, you know, express a particular antigen that then the immune system will sense and you know, try to uh raise antibodies and clear them off. Now, out of those parasites, there will be a tiny amount of them that will switch uh their surface antigen and then escape the immune system. So that has been the challenge with vaccine development. So uh uh it it would actually be interesting to see how, you know, for example, we can develop molecular scaffolds that can be rapidly diversified. For example, if you detect that the parasite has switched their antigen, can you quickly change the vaccine, for example, on an already existing scaffold. Now, when we talk about therapeutics against parasites, um again, they tend to mostly develop resistance quite quickly to drugs that are out there. Um there, for example, let's take an example of uh malaria again. Um there are quite a number of drugs that have been uh developed in the recent past, they don't last long before the parasite develops resistance. Uh because these parasites tend to, you know, salvage a lot of uh their nutrients from their host. So even if they are, you know, mechanism of survival, let's say you shut down an essential enzyme for the parasite, it will start salvaging the same nutrients from the host directly. Yeah, so so those are some of the challenges we've been facing. But um the other thing is to look at some of the very unique enzymes that uh you know, drive the generation of maybe uh nutrients that the parasite cannot salvage from the host. And uh then those enzymes are kind of very conserved, they don't change over time. Um yeah, then the other aspect would be obviously also to look at how, you know, we can use the host innate immunity to resist uh the parasite as well. ",
