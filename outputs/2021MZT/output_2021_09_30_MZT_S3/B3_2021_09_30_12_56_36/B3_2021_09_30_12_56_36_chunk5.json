            "transcript": "So so far we have talked about uh activating the uh the native immune response. We've talked about inhibiting enzymes, we've talked about inhibiting protein protein interactions and hence preventing the pathogen to get in. What are the the possibilities of of another approach? Uh I was thinking about this when William was saying like, well, you can inhibit something but uh if the host still makes the molecule that you're preventing being made, the pathogen still has another way. And I also was thinking about it when Angela was talking about uh um bacteria. So Murk a number of years ago was developing a molecule that actually disregulated protein degradation in bacteria. So rather than inhibiting something, essentially in that case they would turn on protein degradation so much that the the the bacterium was killing itself. Are there any any similar ideas that either are already pursued or that could be pursued in the space of viruses uh and uh parasites and I realized parasite is a very broad term. But in other words, can you use small molecules or or or or large molecules that uh turn something on, disregulate something in the pathogen such that now it isn't missing something, it is it is too active and it starts killing itself. Uh are there are there possibilities in that space that you guys think?",

And so it's now more there's high fidelity when the replication happens and then this can lead to viral extinction. So we we we would like to target that so that uh so that the viruses doesn't adapt to the changes to the selection pressure that is let's say stimulated by the production of antibodies or the treatment with other biotherapeutics uh because you know you always have the problems of resistance and the generation of of of new mutations as we have seen with the different variants for for uh COVID or for SARS-CoV-2.",
