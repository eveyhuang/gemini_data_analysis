            "transcript": "I'm Brenda Rubenstein, assistant professor of chemistry at Brown. Um, I've been spending a lot of time um basing basically evolutionary models on on biophysical characteristics uh that that one can compute. Um, my broader interest and and Angad basically hit it experimentally is is trying to actually create um models that that would actually predict how evolution would proceed on different viruses and how they would change. And the key issue and this is where it connects to his is um we have terrible models of what's going on in the cells. Um, you know, one I I can I can give you binding affinities also wazu to screen compounds, but I can tell you that half of that is meaningless. Um, you know, yes, it could bind in this in this very clean setup, but then is it is it down regulated? Are other proteins expressed? What what is going on? Um, and I really think we need more work that is cross theoretical and and experimental there where we we do actually have genotypic platforms where we can quickly come up with models and design models so that we can do some some level of prediction rapidly. Um, so so I think that's very important. Um, from the prompt, um, I guess I'm most interested in in the notion of of uh, you know, how do you prevent jumping? Uh, you know, can can you think of uh, for example, differences in binding to different glyco proteins um on cell surfaces um that differentiate different species that one can then target. Um, you know, from the theoretical perspective, it's hard to model glyco proteins, it's still a challenge. Um, but but maybe that's that's one place where where people could could jump.",

            "transcript": "It's it's actually French so I I'm it's it's pronounced usually but like Huet it's fine in English. Um, yeah, I'm I work with parasites with eukaryotic parasites so like um same thing uh as uh Danny on as well. I work with parasites that produce malaria. So this class of parasites called complexans. And we use in my lab uh model like a cousin of malaria, it's called Toxoplasma gondi as a as a yeast model for these very divergent organisms. And just thinking about the the prompts that we got and one of them is uh can one target genes that allow cross species infections so as to target pathogens in humans or hosts or limiting jumping events. Uh someone in my lab kind of like is trying to do that at least with my parasite and that I don't know if that can be applied to broader a broader approach but basically we use CRISPR to basically infect cells this you use your pathogen of interest and you infect cells of different hosts, let's say humans, bats, you name it. And then you those cells need to be crispered so those cells need to have uh need to lack certain genes because you basically you prepare them as a library and then you you infect them and then you just look at which ones did infect, which ones did not. And that way you can realize, okay, gene X was missing from these cells, so therefore gene X is used for entry in these cells and so on and so forth. So that's also that's that's something that the CRISPR biology just open up for us. Um, so I think that's something that's pretty pretty feasible.",

Um, and uh the work that I have been doing in the past has been focused in understanding virus host interactions in order for um developing better life attenuated vaccine candidates. And so at Plum Island we can actually design these uh alternative vaccines and then test it in animals and our focus is mainly to control um viral diseases in livestock animals, mainly uh pigs and cows. And something that caught my attention from the talk this morning was that um a lot of the domesticated animals including pigs are serving as amplifiers of uh these uh viruses. And something that I just thought based on the prompt uh questions is to understand perhaps the transcriptomics of these animals and and what I'm mostly interested is the interferon pathway because this is a um restriction natural restriction element that is found in um all mammals and but there is a significant variability among them. So as we compare bats or pigs, there are some evolutionary uh distinction that uh perhaps can help us uh in developing uh better uh biotherapeutics against a specific diseases.",

Yeah, so I'm a parasitologist and uh I know uh Dr. Van Dunk Donk very well because my my wife works as a technician in uh his wife's lab. So we we live in the same neighborhood. Uh, so uh what I do in my lab is um I work on uh protozoan parasites, particularly those that are intracellular. And then on the other side I also work on uh nematode parasites. Those are uh multi cellular organisms. So in the case of uh protozoan parasites, I'm specifically interested in uh you know, identifying small inhibitor molecules for essential enzymes that can further be developed into therapeutics.",

For this I use uh Toxoplasma gondi as my model of study. And so what what we have found is uh uh there are certain animal species uh that are inherently resistant to toxoplasma. And so in that regard we've identified uh host molecules called uh small GTPs immunity associated uh proteins. So what these do is they kind of activate if they are expressed in substantial amounts, they kind of activate the host immune uh system, innate immune system uh such as pyroptosis which kills off the infected cells themselves. So um that kind of relates to one of the prompts um where they say are there biologics uh that can be easily reprogrammed with common delivery platform. So what we've seen is these small GTPs are kind of highly conserved among all mammalian species and the active motif is pretty much the same in all mammals. The only difference is that uh some mammals express them actively after getting infected by an intracellular pathogen and those mammals we found that they tend to be more resistant to uh intracellular pathogens.",
