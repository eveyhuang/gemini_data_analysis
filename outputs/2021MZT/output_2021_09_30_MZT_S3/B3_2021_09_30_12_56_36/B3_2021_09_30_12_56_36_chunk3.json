            "transcript": "Yeah, so uh that depends on what we're looking at like uh in case of parasites, you know, uh the aspect of vaccine development has been very challenging uh because parasites uh for instance uh plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, you know, they keep on switching their antigen. You know, once uh so if you have a population of these parasites when they get into the host, uh a large number of them, you know, express a particular antigen that then the immune system will sense and you know, try to uh raise antibodies and clear them off. Now, out of those parasites, there will be a tiny amount of them that will switch uh their surface antigen and then escape the immune system. So that has been the challenge with vaccine development. So uh uh it it would actually be interesting to see how, you know, for example, we can develop molecular scaffolds that can be rapidly diversified. For example, if you detect that the parasite has switched their antigen, can you quickly change the vaccine, for example, on an already existing scaffold. Now, when we talk about therapeutics against parasites, um again, they tend to mostly develop resistance quite quickly to drugs that are out there. Um there, for example, let's take an example of uh malaria again. Um there are quite a number of drugs that have been uh developed in the recent past, they don't last long before the parasite develops resistance. Uh because these parasites tend to, you know, salvage a lot of uh their nutrients from their host. So even if they are, you know, mechanism of survival, let's say you shut down an essential enzyme for the parasite, it will start salvaging the same nutrients from the host directly. Yeah, so so those are some of the challenges we've been facing. But um the other thing is to look at some of the very unique enzymes that uh you know, drive the generation of maybe uh nutrients that the parasite cannot salvage from the host. And uh then those enzymes are kind of very conserved, they don't change over time. Um yeah, then the other aspect would be obviously also to look at how, you know, we can use the host innate immunity to resist uh the parasite as well.",

But like the problem is that the way I I try to approach it is like a virus is kind of simple compared to a bacteria. Think about it. tuberculosis. We still have the problem 100 years later. Brucella. All of these. So, so I I think all these new approaches have been very focused on virus which is kind of in the simple spectrum. Uh uh bacteria or a parasite like William said needs multiple receptors, multiple mechanisms involved. So I don't know how do everything it's it's going towards this but we're we're we're kind of like narrowing our spectrum versus am I making sense of what I'm I'm I'm trying to say like yes. So it's kind of like complicated that way. So I don't think we can narrow it just to one specific receptor, one specific pathway or one specific area. So that's where it becomes challenging like to to me.",

            "transcript": "Everything that I can add about working with parasites when you talk about parasites, right? Parasites can be worms that are animals or protozoa that are in unicellular eukaryotes. they all have, some are extracellular, toxoplasma and plasmodium are intracellular mostly. So there's so many different things that I don't think you can virus, I don't know anything about virus phylogeny but I think there as as um as was saying is like they're they're more simpler in their approach of entering a cell than uh than any other any other parasites that might enter a cell or might enter might infect a host, right? So and for example, toxoplasma speeds out its own receptors. So there's no there's no natural receptor and that's why toxoplasma infects a third of world population and every single warm blooded animal you can think of. So there's not a universal component. It just it just goes and does its thing. So yeah, it's it's way harder for parasites.",

And so it seems like both Will and Shazelle have ideas about how to harness various mechanisms involved in their immune response, the interferons and this pyroptosis pathway. And I'm wondering about sort of like delivery of the stuff that's going to activate those responses, like have you is that it seems like delivery to the right place in the animal is always a problem and have you thought about",
