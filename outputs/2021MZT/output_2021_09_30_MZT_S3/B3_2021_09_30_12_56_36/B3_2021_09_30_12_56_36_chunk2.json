Um but in my group, um we are interested in big data methods, experimental large scale mutagenesis to understand interactions between viral receptors and viral spike proteins. We use all of that data to engineer the viral receptors as possible. Um again, I apologize for the background noise. Um but to engineer them as as soluble decoy receptors for therapeutic and diagnostic applications, but the methods can also be turned around, we've done a little bit of that and um we can look at how mutations in the the viral spike proteins might impact their um evolution, how they they interact with receptors, how they might become more or less infectious over time.",
