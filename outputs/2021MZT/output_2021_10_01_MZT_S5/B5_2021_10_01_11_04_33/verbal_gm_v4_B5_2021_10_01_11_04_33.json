Um but when they took each other's predictive models and they tried to see how universally applicable they are, um the prediction was not better than random. So basically using the Texas model you would not be able to predict who is going to get a severe disease in the UK and and the same for France.

Is it because the data um collection in the UK and in France and in Texas was so different um or or are we missing some additional variables that that uh are actually the the actual determinants of disease severity that we just haven't taken into account and I think that's something that will that will be a big challenge going forward in terms of unifying um big data analysis and predictive models that are being collected all over the globe um in in trying to stratify um the the applicability and and try to to strive for a certain level of universality in in data collection efforts.

And I know one of the models that they've taken, they've tried to do successfully or not, is to kind of make it uh a group source platform, right? Where they develop certain tools in there, but they've really tried to provide a low bar of entry for other people to create plugins that'll also work in that Chime 2 environment. And so in that case there can be kind of this standard or at least a commonly used environment for analysis, but that has flexibility to add new analysis tools that are going to be sort of well documented within that same uh structure.

And even within say one category of parasite like Tripanosomacruzi, uh causative agent of Shaga's disease, can we identify some markers within even those parasites and say, you know, this one because it has this marker will likely um be more likely to be spread among humans rather than dogs for something like that. Uh, and then we realized that actually this process of crossing is three different steps. There's the initial jump, then there is an adaptation which it um involves connecting with the immune system and getting the parasite to where it could live in uh its new environment and its new host.

So, uh Brenda took the notes and I'll be doing the report out and this is kind of a great segue from the previous conversation on spillover. Uh, the precision surveillance room had a great conversation, um very lively. Um, and we identified several gaps, ideas and challenges uh to report out about. So, um from a gaps perspective, um infrastructure gaps are huge. So, technologically speaking, you know, having sensors and tools to do monitoring and precision surveillance, you know, there are some tools out there already, there are some sensors coming online, but really we need to be, you know, filling some of these infrastructure gaps to develop these these necessary tools. Having the people with the necessary expertise to do the surveillance can be a challenge, especially on the scale that we realistically need to do, you know, so much surveillance for so many diverse uh pathogen systems out there. Um, and then, you know, a similar concept that was discussed yesterday after the vector born disease is surveillance follows the money. Um, and, you know, there's not always a lot of money in in the prevention, there's the money in the cleanup after something happens. Um, and so realistically finding ways to fund um the surveillance aspects so we can prevent a problem before it even becomes an issue, um is going to be key. Um, we need to be developing novel and and newer technologies and deploying those in the field. I know there are several new technologies that are being tested right now all all around the world. Um, but really getting those up and online, um sooner rather than later is is key to preventing the next, you know, big outbreak. Um, we need to be optimizing where surveillance is being conductive. Um, and and this is kind of in reference to, you know, in areas where you've got a university or you've got a big city, you tend to have a whole lot of surveillance going around in a very limited scope around those locations, but then you've got the rest of the world that maybe isn't getting nearly enough surveillance, you know, effort going into them. So, are there ways we can model the best optimized surveillance networks to get the best bang for our buck? Um, we we talked about the possibility of having universal assays of pathogens that we can use in many, many different systems, so you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you can use the same assays across diverse systems, um using variable tech. Um, and we also talked about the possibility of using environmental DNA techniques for the surveillance of of smaller animals and vectors, um where you maybe can't put wearable tech on a mouse or a mosquito, um but you can use DNA that's present in the environment to kind of monitor and surveil those populations. Um, and and really we just talked about the gap of that communication barrier between the engineers and the biologists. So, you've got a biologist who knows exactly what they want to measure, but they don't really know the engineering challenges behind how they get there. And then you have the engineers who know how to get there, but they're not entirely clear on on what the biologists are looking for. So, finding a way to bridge that gap so we can make sure there's clear communication in the precision surveillance tools that we're looking for. So, we had a couple of interesting ideas. Um, and one of the big one that we talked about kind of at length was um using chemical signals to sense pathogens in the environment passively. Um, so, you know, possibly using color sensor technology, um, you know, for like a vector born disease, if a mosquito deposit deposits virus on this color changing card and the card changes color, then we know that there was virus deposited there, we know there's virus in the environment. So, talking about using um color changing technology to to possibly monitor uh pathogens in in the wild. Um, and and it also came up talking about nanoparticle sensors, um where we've got antibodies on these nanoparticle sensors that will change color upon detection of antigens and and you can use that in diverse systems, it's not just vector born diseases, but also in situations where you've got more directly transmitted pathogens as well in an animal, um animal to animal contact environment. Um, and then challenges and opportunities. This left us with a lot of questions and not always a lot of answers. Um, and that's because surveillance has to kind of assume a lot of different forms based on what you're looking at. So, surveiling for mosquito board diseases is going to be very different from surveiling for brucelosis and so we kind of talked about some of those differences and challenges moving forward. Um, and ultimately how does precision testing translate into action? So, we can test for everything in the world, we can do all the surveillance in the world, but how do we take those data and actually put them into action and and act on them? Um, how what do you do and when do you enact some type of action after after making that surveillance. Um, realistically a big challenge is coming out with simple tools that minimize personnel requirements. Not everybody has, you know, a huge group of people who can go in and do a million PCRs and do a million identifications of mosquitoes and do a whole lot of this work. We need simple tools that can be used by anybody, possibly even a citizen science approach, um that will improve surveillance on a large scale. And then we talked about a very serious uh surveillance challenge on kind of smaller family farms that can be the source of disease because there can be barriers there where, you know, people don't want you to make that detection on their farm. It can mean something bad for their farm if you detect something in their animals. So, so there's a very real challenge in uh kind of bridging those cultural barriers and even legal barriers with our our farms so we can do surveillance, but not in a way that harms anybody's livelihood. Um, so like I said, very good conversation in our group. We talked about a lot of things. I tend to think we're the best group. ",
