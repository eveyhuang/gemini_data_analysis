            "transcript": "the Zika virus outbreak in the new world. Um, and in that case, you know, we could very easily, we thought we were sequencing a lot of genomes, right? We could still take all of the genomes and basically put them into a single analysis, phylogenetic, phylodynamic analysis and you know, for some of these bigger data sets, maybe we had to let them churn for a few weeks to sort of push through these complex models, but it was possible. Um, the scale of this outbreak in the, you know, the ubiquity now of next generation sequencing and the people are sequencing these things everywhere all around the world. Um, it really has gotten to the point where we can't just grab all of the SARS, I mean, we haven't been able to for a long time, just grab all the SARS coronavirus two sequences and throw them into one of these analyses. And so I think it really has posed these challenges of how we deal with this data set. We can't look at everything. We either need new methods that are going to allow us to look at everything, or we have to somehow subsample this um to work with our existing methods and it's been kind of interesting to see. I mean, even the people who are developing these Bayesian phylogenetic methods, it's been really interesting to see their papers come out and how they've kind of worked through this process and how they've decided to navigate dealing with these gigantic data sets and they've all, they've all come with some caveats.",

Can people, I mean, is there are there challenges with everyone analyzing the same genome sets in different ways and coming to different conclusions and how do you is do you need to standardize that across the you know, how how do you come out of um different analysis methods for the same data sets.",

I don't know that I have a good good answer to that exact question, but when you bring up everybody having their own uh GitHub site and developing their own software, one of the biggest issues that I see there is that we all end up developing software for maybe this one paper or this one project and then it kind of gets abandoned. And so you just have all of this old non maintained code floating around and somebody wants to redo the analysis, but now they go to your package that's five years old and all the pieces aren't working on their machine and do they try to rebuild it? Do they try to salvage what you had? Um, that sort of uh the the the ashes of old computer science programs and and how we better maintain that for for people to use. I think is a really important topic uh as well.",

            "transcript": "But what do what do people think is the solution here? Um, there was uh let's say 10 five to 10 years ago the the sort of commensal microbiome field had the same had the same challenge. Everybody was for each paper there was a new method being developed to analyze one specific data set and it was basically obsolete two years later because the the technology had moved on. It was much more appropriate to use new analysis methods. Um, and there was there was no uh sort of authority in the field that would that would uh lead the way in terms of which kind of analysis methods are to be used and I don't think there should be an authority um because because a lot still depends on the creativity of each individual group um coming up with their own analysis methods. So I don't think we should undermine the general trend of uh you know, people developing their own methods because they think that that's what's working best in in their individual case. But but uh I was wondering what people think about um because in the in the in the commensal microbiome field it hasn't been solved. It's still very fragmented and and analysis outcomes definitely depend on the tool that is being used. But for something that is maybe um of more global urgency or or uh um immediate public health relevance, should there be um should there be uh an effort to unify the tools and and if yes, who do we who do we, you know, who charge with this task.",

I don't know. I don't see that kind of like forced unification uh as being really tenable. Um, I mean, I think so one example that is in the microbiome field that I'm I'm not a I don't study the microbiome, but I have a colleague here who leads kind of the lead development group of Chime 2. And I know one of the models that they've taken, they've tried to do successfully or not, is to kind of make it uh a group source platform, right? Where they develop certain tools in there, but they've really tried to provide a low bar of entry for other people to create plugins that'll also work in that Chime 2 environment. And so in that case there can be kind of this standard or at least a commonly used environment for analysis, but that has flexibility to add new analysis tools that are going to be sort of well documented within that same uh structure.",

You know, when these platforms get developed then it's key that there's continued funding to keep developing and maintaining those platforms, otherwise they become out of date and they're not useful anymore.",

But I think that maybe coming up with better tools in terms of that preprocessing, um, even with joining and joining disjointed data sets and tables together. Um, I've done some work with the NCBI, um, data sets that they have available looking at multi-drug resistance antibiotic and um or bacteria that are multi-drug resistant and just looking at AMR issues and kind of trying to um track that through these data sets. And the NCBI data sets are they're a disaster in terms of even being able to filter them together. So I think that even just developing, I mean, maybe the consistency is not in the data that's being put out, but maybe there's some consistency in how we preprocess and um join and create data sets of usable data that can then be um used in terms of put fed into black boxes, put into algorithms, you know, apply algorithms to data that has been processed in a similar way. Um, I feel like we we are lagging in that in terms of those tools developments.",
