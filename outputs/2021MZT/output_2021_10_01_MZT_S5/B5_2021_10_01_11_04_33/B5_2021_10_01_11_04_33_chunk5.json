So thinking again about this one of the questions about that infrastructure piece. obviously that stuff is expensive and even, you know, utilizing free data once you've downloaded and you have the storage issue and then you've got, you know, there's funds associated with that. Sorry, it was a little bit of a stream of consciousness. That was good.",

So um have no experience at Virginia Tech with this, but do have experience at Purdue, which is considered I mean it's one of the top five public institutions and it's got a really um big data science center and the storage limits on data storage and then the amount of cost associated with storing big data data sets was prohibitive. I ended up um buying my own server and it was actually cheaper for me as a assistant professor to use startup funds to purchase a server than it was to utilize storage space on the university owned servers.",

Um they do give a little bit of storage on there, but primarily so far I've been using the my Google account through the university and having unlimited storage on Google Drive, which has been fantastic. I'm a little bit worried how long Google's going to be able to keep that up. Um seems like they're always shifting the baselines there. So I guess I'm a little bit worried about that in the future, but for now it hasn't been an issue. Moving data between these various places can be a pain, but",
