Uh, so we um, we had a couple topics that you know, had been thrown out and we all realized that they kind of morphed into um, one of the questions uh and that was a question that somebody was currently pursuing, so we had a good um place to start. Um, but basically, and this is a lot from the parasite perspective, but not entirely. Uh, so, so ideally, of course, you know, we'd all like to know are there markers out there um for for these parasites that are, you know, are floating around of which there are many that um would allow us to differentiate between um different uh groups of different different hosts that this parasite would be more or less likely to be able to infect. And even within say one category of parasite like Tripanosomacruzi, uh causative agent of Shaga's disease, can we identify some markers within even those parasites and say, you know, this one because it has this marker will likely um be more likely to be spread among humans rather than dogs for something like that. Uh, and then we realized that actually this process of crossing is three different steps. There's the initial jump, then there is an adaptation which it um involves connecting with the immune system and getting the parasite to where it could live in uh its new environment and its new host. And then the ability to actually be spread among a human or livestock population and um the analogy of uh the step one there, the jump being the spark and um the step three being a raging wildfire is something that I'm going to come back to real quickly here. Uh, but um in addition, you know, it's just just looking at how would we look at these markers.",

Um, and um, we also brought up the fact that we can find these markers, but if they're in markers populations of reservoirs that never have contact with human and livestock, does it matter? So where as well as what gets samples is going to be very, very important. Um, what do we do if we find something uh is has been brought up a lot. Again, that relates to what does this ability to identify a predictive marker get us and we think we need to answer that. So is the science or the policy more important here? And then also, you know, maybe looking more at that step two, when we find a marker, you know, under understanding whether um these there's there's an inherent fitness or disadvantage or disadvantage when it comes to adaptation and spread is also going to be crucial and um how would we model the likelihood of this are is another outstanding question. So just a lot of questions that we have that we feel we should focus on.",
