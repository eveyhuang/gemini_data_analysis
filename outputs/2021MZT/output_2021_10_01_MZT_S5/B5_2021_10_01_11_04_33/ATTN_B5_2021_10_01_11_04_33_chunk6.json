I think this has worked pretty well in some in some early applications and in some regions that it was um um it where it reached a density of smartphone users that was sufficient to to successfully report outbreaks or to to anticipate outbreaks.",

Yeah, we haven't done any of this work ourselves and I I was wondering how um what's the um first of all what's the critical mass of people that are needed to to do this um type of work would this work in a let's say in an in an individual neighborhood of Philadelphia, could we could we protect ourselves by basically placing human sentinels and their smartphones strategically in different areas of the neighborhood to to basically catch thing catch catch developments very early and then respond on a local level before we wait for the you know the mayor of Philadelphia to take actions that are that are citywide. So can we can we basically micromanage the the pandemic in this way um by by generating very rapid sort of local feedback loops um and and if that's the goal um do we have the are are the tools accurate enough? Like can we solely rely on self-reported um temperature or or self-reported well-being for this to be effective.",

      "transcript": "Well, I was just going to speak from like the user perspective at NAU last year, they tried to mandate this type of self-reporting using their website or their app where every day they wanted every member of the community regardless of whether you were coming to campus or not to like answer these few questions about whether you had symptoms and what your temperature was and this and that and uh as sort of a I had no desire to integrate that into a standard part of my life, I can tell you. I just found it to be completely tedious and I would never just go out and do it and then then then they had another option where they would just start texting me to say, you know, are you feeling any symptoms every three days and I would just reply no and they'd say, okay, that counts. But it's like I think people are going to get tired of that very quickly. So in terms of something where the user has to actively enter data that needs to be accurate and useful, I just don't see it as being realistic.",

And I think we do have really fantastic tools that have already been developed like for instance, you know, most people are wearing this type of a tracking device on their body already and we can do things like add temperature sensors to smart watches and fitbits um those activity trackers where we can couple body temperature along with activity so you're not getting counted as having been febrile if you're actively working out or whatever.",
