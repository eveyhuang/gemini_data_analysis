            "transcript": "I think one one interesting aspect uh to the to this entire discussion is that um we haven't really figured out the problem of um uh differences that are generated by batches of measurement technologies or or even geographical differences. There was this very famous example that I'm sure many of you are familiar with where I think uh five or six years ago um people in the UK and France and in Texas independently tried to predict the severity of a flu infection based on multiple parameters that they collected on the host and they came up with predictive models that very accurately predicted um the uh the the expected severity of the infection based on the parameters that they measured. Um but when they took each other's predictive models and they tried to see how universally applicable they are, um the prediction was not better than random. So basically using the Texas model you would not be able to predict who is going to get a severe disease in the UK and and the same for France. Um so so the question is are these are these models uh locally restricted? Is it because the data um collection in the UK and in France and in Texas was so different um or or are we missing some additional variables that that uh are actually the the actual determinants of disease severity that we just haven't taken into account and I think that's something that will that will be a big challenge going forward in terms of unifying um big data analysis and predictive models that are being collected all over the globe um in in trying to stratify um the the applicability and and try to to strive for a certain level of universality in in data collection efforts.",
