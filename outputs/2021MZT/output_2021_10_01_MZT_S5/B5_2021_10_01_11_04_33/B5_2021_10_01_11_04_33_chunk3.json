Like the the models can't predict the the outcomes of data that they haven't seen. And and that's just that's reality.

Um I don't know exactly know how we do that, but I do think and I do think for some systems and so I was talking to somebody yesterday and he pointed me to a really interesting influenza paper. So for some systems where we have so this is it's funny. It's almost like a as a little bit of a not a totally counter example to what was just said because I don't know if they did sort of the out of sample from like Texas to France in that in that case. Um but what they were seeing is that they'd been a bunch of like CDC does the influenza prediction um kind of contest yearly. Um and you know, there's a variety of, you know, machine learn learning models, more mechanistic models and sort of hybrids. And so this group developed kind of a really simple kind of SIR type model compartmental model with sort of a hybrid um kind of a mechanistic statistical approach that was layered on. And so they were able to capture these kind of general mechanistic trends which you would expect given kind of the general mechanisms that we know influenza spreads by. Um and then we're able to sort of count for some of the the systematic biases with kind of an a mechanistic black box thing. We don't really know why we have these systematic biases, but we can use mechanisms to predict sort of the broader trend.",

So why we want to collect as many as possible measurement? The reason is if we know what X can indicate Y, we do not need to collect so many data, right?

You know, what what new information do we need in all of that sequence information to be able to you know, prepare for changes in the future and and you know, plan how for example, a SARS CoV2 might might change and have some new variant surge?

Um but like a great example here is Jesse Bloom's group at the Fred Hutch, who's been doing these really powerful studies to map sort of which amino acids allow for escape from antibody responses.
