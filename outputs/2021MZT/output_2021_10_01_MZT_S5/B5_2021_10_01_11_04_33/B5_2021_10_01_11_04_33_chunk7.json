And I think they've done a lot of improvements during the outbreak, uh but definitely in the beginning that was a total mess uh to deal with and to try to get data out of in a clean way. Um, so and having those two separate repositories, I don't think was really doing us much in the way of favors. I think the benefit of GISAID is that it sort of came with this built in protection for scientists that their data couldn't be used without proper acknowledgement or without contacting them prior to publishing the data and I think that that's probably why it took over over NCBI.",

There's also something to be said for having clean and accessible and usable data or data that's easy to integrate with other, you know, data sets that are already in existence. And I'm wondering if maybe that's that uncertainty around not not having a clear right answer is maybe the message that that goes onto a bullet point here. Because I think that with a lot of these issues, you know, it's the same thing as like balancing technology and privacy, you know, I I feel like there's a lot of these where there's there's a lot of nuance necessary to to come up with the best right answer, but I don't know that there is a right answer to some of these questions.",
