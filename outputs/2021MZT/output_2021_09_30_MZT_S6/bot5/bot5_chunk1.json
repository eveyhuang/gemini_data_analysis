Um, we often work at the wildlife livestock interface and so I'm super excited about this conference. Um, I'm currently working with rabies virus in raccoons in the Eastern United States and also rabies virus and skunks in the Mountain West. Uh previously worked with avian influenza virus, just studying genomics of avian influenza virus. Um, also a number of vector borne pathogens, I'm particularly studying vector ecology using genomic tools.
