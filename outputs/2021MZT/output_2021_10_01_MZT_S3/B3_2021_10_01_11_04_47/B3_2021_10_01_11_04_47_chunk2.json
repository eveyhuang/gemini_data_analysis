I want to just go back to the the prompt question that that I threw out there for you to consider. And of course we have some other big questions to think about. These these discussions I I'd like to be the facilitator, not the director. And so I hope you've had a chance to think about and write and maybe even write down what you think is is a point of of gap in in precision surveillance that you think needs to be addressed. and then we can kind of wander from there and and take the conversation in the directions that you as a group would like to go. I I recognize I'm trying to monitor the chat at the same time that Dr. Rubenstein's graciously agreed to take some notes. However, she's going to be work having to meet with a seminar speaker during the time in which we'll be reporting out. So would love for somebody else to to take the lead and agree to report out on on our notes from the session. Who would like to do that?",
