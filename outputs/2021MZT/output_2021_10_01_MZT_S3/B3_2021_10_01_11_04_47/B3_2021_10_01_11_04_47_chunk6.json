Uh, you know, uh, many years ago when I started nanotechnology research, the idea was you're going to do everything chemically. Things going to work really perfectly. You don't have to spend any kind of, you know, advanced, you don't have to use any kind of advanced instrument. You're going to use self-assembling processes to create structures, right? Uh, that sounded really well, but the chemistry is difficult to control. Uh, what happened over the years, the technology, the semiconductor technology improved to the point, we can make transistors like three nanometer size with feature sizes with three nanometers. That's like 30 atoms next to each other. So like, you know, I I believe top down approaches, basically taking technology and simplifying rather than starting with some simple and then expecting it to work.",

You're dealing with these five parameters, versus you have a complex technology, you start to simplify it, you bring it down. Uh, and that's actually pretty much what we observe in semiconductor technologies. Now they can make things like chemically impossible to synthesize, you know, uh at the scale comparable to tens of atoms, you know.",

Um perhaps it's time to provide uh Dr. McGregor with some guidance about um what we'd like to share back with the group in terms of uh challenges and opportunities that we think exist here in the uh the persistent surveillance uh set. Uh uh Dr. Yanik provided us with the with a really important perspective in terms of uh you know there there are ways to approach this from uh thinking about existing technologies and and trying to simplify things. Uh I I I certainly respect that um being able to detect things reliably reliably and within um small concentrations and making it relatively simple and inexpensive and um uh it's going to survive in the field are are all things that are uh that have to be taken into consideration. Um and and whether the that surveillance gathering is done by by you know by a human with with a device like this or whether it's it's um somehow telegraphed uh through um through a a network of uh broadband uh access which is another problem that we have in rural areas uh is is sort of left left to be seen but there there's no doubt uh I think opportunity in this space for for really sorting out some some complex challenges. So from what we heard this morning and this afternoon, what uh what guidance can we provide Dr. McGregor?",

So, um, I think for a vector born disease or vector born diseases, that's going to be much, much different than for something like I'm trying to do or a disease that's not um, you know, I don't have a vector. I I need to worry about the animal. Is it going to be a wildlife versus a domestic animal, right?",

            "transcript": "So it almost seems like the technology platforms are out there. Um, we just need to figure out, you know, what's our target? Are we trying to get a big picture that then we can say, okay, we know that there is a virus. Uh now let's go back to that side and figure out which virus, right? So, um, I I think Crystal was pointing to to that, right? That you can say, well, here we can tell you that there is some virus, but maybe go back later and so the precision is not necessarily telling you what the pathogen is, but maybe it's telling you that there is a viral infection or a bacterial infection or a parasitic infection. So it almost seems like um maybe the biggest challenge is that we need to think more closely in terms of what we are trying to what we're trying to accomplish and communicate that to the engineers, right? Because the engineers can say, oh yeah, yeah, we can we can develop that. We can we can do a color change, we can do um, we can we can develop a detection method, but then how do we use that information, right? How does that inform us? Is that really surveillance or is that just like, oh, we we have a color change, right? So, so maybe maybe that's part of of the problem is really identifying what true precision is for us and what does that precision mean in terms of decision making, policy making or going back and doing further, you know, further testing.",
