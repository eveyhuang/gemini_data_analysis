You've got a um, uh, a a chemical species that exists in that environment and that causes the plant to change color and in irreversible way. Um, or or express itself with a color in an irreversible way. Um, some of that research goes back to uh, Dira project that was very interested in looking at weapons of mass destruction and the presence of of uh controlled chemical species. So think Sarin, think um, uh chemical stimuli like that that uh, these plants could act as a passive sentinel and express a color change if there happens to be and relatively quickly by the way, uh, if there happens to be the presence of a chemical uh agent like that. Um, lots of things to consider in terms of of concentration of of the the the the molecule you're trying to detect. Uh, this is not this is not natural for plants to necessarily do this, so it's a bit of a genetic engineering into a plant species that could express this uh um, this response. But are there are there things that vectors could ex would express as molecular um uh uh molecular expressions that's a terrible sentence. But hopefully you're following where I'm going, but do ticks and um, mosquitoes express chemical agents um, when they are carrying a particular um disease as the host or as the vector I should say. Um, or or what about something that is the um really the um the well for a disease that is not the vector but exists as you know, that's the natural state of the disease, a vector takes it from animal A and brings it to animal B through a um, you know, a tick bite or mosquito um harvesting of blood. Uh, but are there chemical signals that are expressed by species uh that that could ness could be somehow sensed in a in a passive way.",

So it's literally just a small card with honey and the mosquitoes live in that trap will just continuously feed on that honey depositing saliva and then they'll test that honey card for virus as well. So yeah, if we could come up with something where there is a color change in a honey card from field collected um mosquitoes, that would be a game changer because that would cut the amount of effort you have to put into testing all of those cards in half.
