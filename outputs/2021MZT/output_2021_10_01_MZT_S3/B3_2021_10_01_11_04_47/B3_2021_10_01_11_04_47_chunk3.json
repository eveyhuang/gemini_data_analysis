The problem with those of course is that they're very heterogeneously applied even in our passive surveillance programs. We get some are rock stars who submit like once a week and then people who maybe submit once and then they're done. So so you'd need to to develop a way to actually get people to participate and give give you some really useful data.",

So they're only going to look for West Nile and St. Louis encephalitis virus and occasionally maybe Western Equine, but um anything else that could come in, that's not going to be detected because they're so specific on what they're looking for.",

Um and if not, I was thinking about it. So we use one thing that I think about when I think when considering viruses is that you know we've got pan flavivirus assays, we've got pan alpha virus assays, of course a pan coronavirus assay is what was used to identify SARS COV2. I think it would be really interesting to go along all viruses and develop pan assays for all of these different groups in a multiplex fashion where somebody could just run it on a gel, you know, just really low tech, right? So you're running it on a gel and there's size selected so you would know what banding size would end up corresponding to a particular viral family and then drill in there.",

It's feeding into an algorithm and then when there're changes in that pattern of behavior for that animal, it can flag of, you know, the manager, the supervisor and said there could be something wrong with that animal so at least it it keys you into you may not know what's wrong, but you know that something is not right. Um it's sort of that signal is coming to you. But again, I think the technology is there, it just needs to be developed and going back to, you know, how I started this conversation in terms of the infrastructure, right? Uh how are we going to pay for that? How are we going to pay for the, you know, the sensors that need to read um so there's quite a bit there, but I think the technology is working in that direction and at least in human medicine that's certainly taking off.",

That can be measured. I mean, I think that would if if you can make it pathogen specific, right? That would be wonderful.",

Um and anytime that animal comes into feed or comes into get a drink of water, there's just send, you know, there's a reader there that's measuring that response, right? So that way you don't have to go out into the field or into your barn space to detect that pathogen. Um it's sort of that signal is coming to you.",
