Um, some of that research goes back to uh, Dira project that was very interested in looking at weapons of mass destruction and the presence of of uh controlled chemical species.

Um, lots of things to consider in terms of of concentration of of the the the the molecule you're trying to detect. Uh, this is not this is not natural for plants to necessarily do this, so it's a bit of a genetic engineering into a plant species that could express this uh um, this response. But are there are there things that vectors could ex would express as molecular um uh uh molecular expressions that's a terrible sentence. But hopefully you're following where I'm going, but do ticks and um, mosquitoes express chemical agents um, when they are carrying a particular um disease as the host or as the vector I should say. Um, or or what about something that is the um really the um the well for a disease that is not the vector but exists as you know, that's the natural state of the disease, a vector takes it from animal A and brings it to animal B through a um, you know, a tick bite or mosquito um harvesting of blood.

What are the drivers that are making uh that these pathogens make the jump? a lot had to do with ecology of the host uh uh and uh also the human involvement. So we were talking about uh animal migration and animal density have how that affects uh this spillover effects. But one thing that uh we also talk about is how is human activities affecting this? And one of examples that were discussed in the group was in influenza, how human migration into a certain areas where there are infected wild birds increases the chances of that spillover effect. And how and how we should be putting this human movement into predicting models. Like uh how do we gather that data? And one possibility is the use of cell phone data uh to monitor uh human movement. Uh, when we are developing these uh models to look into uh the prediction of spill over events. And uh because of that we decided that it's a good idea to start looking at metabolic and immunologic markers that can uh be surveyed in specific host populations and that can be included into models to then put it at an ecological landscape level.

But then you've got the rest of the world that maybe isn't getting nearly enough surveillance, you know, effort going into them. So are there ways we can model the best optimized surveillance networks to get the best bang for our buck. Um we we talked about the possibility of having universal assays of pathogens that we can use in many, many different systems. So you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you can use the same assays across diverse systems, um using variable tech. ",

Um and and really we just talked about the gap of that communication barrier between the engineers and the biologists. So you've got a biologist who knows exactly what they want to measure, but they don't really know the engineering challenges behind how they get there. And then you have the engineers who know how to get there, but they're not entirely clear on on what the biologists are looking for. So finding a way to bridge that gap so we can make sure there's clear communication in the precision surveillance tools that we're looking for. ",

        "utterance": "Linda Detwiler: So we had a couple of interesting ideas. Um and one of the big ones that we talked about kind of at length was um using chemical signals to sense pathogens in the environment passively. Um so, you know, possibly using sensor technology, um, you know, for like a vector born disease, if a mosquito deposit deposits virus on this color changing card and the card changes color, then we know that there was virus deposited there, we know there's virus in the environment. So talking about using um color changing technology to to possibly monitor uh pathogens in in the wild. Um and and it also came up talking about nanoparticle sensors, um where we've got antibodies on these nanoparticle sensors that will change color upon detection of antigens and and you can use that in diverse systems, it's not just vector born diseases, but also in situations where you've got um more directly transmitted pathogens as well in an animal, um animal to animal contact environment. Um realistically a big challenge is coming out with simple tools that minimize personnel requirements. Not everybody has, you know, a huge group of people who can go in and do a million PCRs and do a million identifications of mosquitoes and do a whole lot of this work. We need simple tools that can be used by anybody, possibly even a citizen science approach, um that will improve surveillance on a large scale. And then we talked about a very serious uh surveillance challenge on kind of smaller family farms that can be the source of disease because there can be barriers there where, you know, people don't want you to make that detection on their farm. It can mean something bad for their farm if you detect something in their animals. ",
