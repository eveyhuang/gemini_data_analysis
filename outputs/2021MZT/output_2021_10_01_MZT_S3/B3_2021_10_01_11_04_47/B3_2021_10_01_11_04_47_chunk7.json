Most of what I've done so far has been individual, you know, manpower samples, but we do have some high throughput systems we're standing up right now that are going to improve that quite a bit. You know, I think that kind of to your earlier point, there is an opportunity here, you know, if we're from again, a vector of standpoint, I know that doesn't apply to everybody, but if we're if we're collecting mosquitoes, if we have a trap that also has one of these color changing devices in it, you still have all of those mosquitoes in that trap. They can feed on that card and and indicate whether or not they're depositing viruses, and then you've still got the individuals if you want to take them back, double check, test those mosquitoes and find out, you know, which species were positive, was it a false positive and there are ways to kind of double check those outcomes as well. So I I don't I I know that there are probably things that might cause a false color change or cause false positives, but I think there are ways to to, you know, have a backup system as well.",

So there might be an additional opportunity then to, you know, can you do a deeper oops, sorry. Um a deeper dive to see what what the blood meal was from.

Uh, someone mentioned earlier challenges in in the small farms, the family farms where um you kind of get that that primordial soup of of zonatic disease that involves pigs, people and poultry that um can can really represent some some significant challenges both from a um you know, a cultural view on on on those farms to introducing surveillance there.
