Um, but basically, and this is a lot from the parasite perspective but not entirely. Uh, so so ideally, of course, you know, we'd all like to know are there markers out there um for for these parasites that are, you know, are floating around of which there are many that um would allow us to differentiate between um different uh groups of different different hosts that this parasite would be more or less likely to be able to infect.",

Uh, and then we realized that actually this process of crossing is three different steps. There's the initial jump, then there is an adaptation which it um involves uh connecting with the immune system and getting the parasite to where it can live in uh its new environment, its new host. And then the ability to actually be spread among a human or livestock population and um the analogy of uh the step one there, the jump being the spark and um the step three being a raging wildfire is something that I'm going to come back to real quickly here. Uh, but um in addition, you know, just just looking at how would we look at these markers, um some of the unknown questions, some of the things that would have to be addressed is um we don't understand the frequency of these markers, how often they would change in in different reservoir populations, what the best reservoir to check would be and um whether the homogeneity of the reservoirs and the hosts should matter.",

Uh, so a lot of the questions that came at the inspiration that came uh in when we were talking about the spillover uh is what are the drivers? What are the drivers that are making uh that these pathogens make the jump? a lot had to do with ecology of the host uh uh and uh also the human involvement. So we were talking about uh animal migration and animal density have how that affects uh this spillover effects. But one thing that uh we also talk about is how is human activities affecting this? And one of examples that were discussed in the group was in influenza, how human migration into a certain areas where there are infected wild birds increases the chances of that spillover effect. And how and how we should be putting this human movement into predicting models. Like uh how do we gather that data? And one possibility is the use of cell phone data uh to monitor uh human movement. Uh, when we are developing these uh models to look into uh the prediction of spill over events. And uh because of that we decided that it's a good idea to start looking at metabolic and immunologic markers that can uh be surveyed in specific host populations and that can be included into models to then put it at an ecological landscape level. And to include also the microbiome data because we know the microbiome will also",
