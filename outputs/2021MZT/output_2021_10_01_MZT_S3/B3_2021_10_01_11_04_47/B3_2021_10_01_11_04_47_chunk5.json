You can take three to 3,000 in a matter of whatever K happens to be in that rate constant. I don't have a feel for that, but I I was just looking for maybe there's something really simple that I can sort of like",

Let's say gold nanoparticles are reddish. But then when you bind something to their surface, you can functionalize them so that when some a marker of that virus, a specific virus or specific pathogen would bind to them, their color will change, right? So you would have a paper based passive um sensor that as more and more mosquito feed from it if they release if there's a release of some agent on that strip, it would change color. And then it could be made so that different strip are sensitive to different pathogens and something like this would be very simple to it could just be printed once the the active material is known it can just be printed, it could be left somewhere and collected uh every so often. So that's I think that sounds like a cool",

In order when you start basically going into the washing aspects of things basically, you know, removing things that are not specific to the environment can stick for multiple reasons. So you have to remove those guys. And in order to remove them, you are talking about now something that cannot do it itself. You're going to need a power source. Uh, you know, so that requires you to start going adding things into your system. So every time you go something more specific, it is going to get more complex. Uh, you know, reading I'm not worried about it. The the the main part I'm generally worried about is uh is the fluidics. Uh, you have to have fluidics unless I mean unless you are looking for like the wearable tech kind of stuff. Uh, if you are looking for for biomarkers, you're going to need fluidics. Uh, that's why I was more interested in water because you can use that as your medium. Uh, and you can wash things away you can make it in a very simple way in these days uh things actually advance significantly. You don't need a 10 pound instrument.

So in other words, uh, there is a lot of devil in the detail. Uh, and that kind of comes out once you start testing it. Uh, and uh that is the part that I was earlier saying, uh, it generally happens when the engineers really start talking with the medical scientists or or, you know, uh, uh, you know, experts in the field and start testing things, you know, I'm sure there are things to be addressed. Uh, you know, there are technologies that can be used to address these things. Uh, but often uh the issue uh, you know, what I uh feel like it's it's it's creating a bottleneck is that communication. Uh, you know, without that uh, you know, the engineers write good papers uh, you know, show something fancy that is how you write a paper basically. Uh, but then it never materializes in real world conditions. So I think there is there is a balance. We need to strike some kind of a balance in terms of simplicity and and the sensitivity.
