Um, and they had like so they figured out how to get environmental covariance in there, which is really challenging, but they were working with ants and cells, so it was easier than uh than anything else. Um, but they they had like um features that describe social context, they had features describing like your turning angle to get to your longest view shed and like all these kind of like clever features that might be, you know, that you could broadly extract from Movebank and then do some kind of like I think you could do something really cool on the machine learning front. It wouldn't I don't know Mark that that would get to like the macroecology of movement in the way that you were thinking about it. It was definitely not how Becker answered. Um, but it seems like there might be something there that has a lot of potential to say like, you know, where do we see, you know, high you know, short step length, high turning angle movements writ large across you know, this taxon.",

So you could say, oh here's your turning angle to every single one of your neighbors and also to your big view shed, right? So you can let social and spatial forces compete with one another, which so now they're setting up systems like this with continuous time monitoring in monkeys and wolves in Ethiopia. Like Ian Cousins got like five of these going um on like big systems, megafauna systems. Um, and yeah, I I mean I think we don't I don't think we know like the extent to which social and spatial factors compete to drive movement. But um, I think there's I think it's coming. I think it's coming out of machine learning. I don't think it's coming out of conventional statistical inference because I just I think those problems are too hard.
