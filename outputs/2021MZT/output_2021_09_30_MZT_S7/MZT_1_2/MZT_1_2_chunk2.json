I I I it's it's it's mixed. And uh, uh, but uh, my contact with um animal movement has been during uh my PhD, I studied the statistical properties of movement of C Elegans, um, and it was a really good opportunity to link movement with behavior. Um, something that it's really hard unless you have an amazing data set, um, which um they are very hard to get, but in model systems that make becomes a little bit more feasible. And during my postdoc, then I I switched to another level. I worked quite a bit with cattle movements um to study bovine TB transmission. So cattle movements uh between farms. So it is more like from a network perspective rather than a statistical um or or let's say a trajectory um perspective.",

Like are and and what's unclear to me is to what extent should those axes kind of arise from like an epidemiological place versus from uh, you know, from an environmental context place or social social ecology place like do we care about all of those or not and what should they be?

It's kind of reiterating what you just said, but there are so many different factors that drive different movement patterns and just, you know, insects come to mind for me because, you know, talking about like the migration of the caribou in Northern Canada, they found that insect populations actually drive these caribou migrations. You know, insect pressure can drive animals to move quite a bit. And then you're not just talking about the insects because then you also have to consider all of the factors that go into where those insects are at and why they're at the populations that they're at that are driving those movements.
