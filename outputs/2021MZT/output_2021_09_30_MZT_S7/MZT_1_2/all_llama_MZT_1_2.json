It's kind of reiterating what you just said, but there are so many different factors that drive different movement patterns and just, you know, insects come to mind for me because, you know, talking about like the migration of the caribou in Northern Canada, they found that insect populations actually drive these caribou migrations. You know, insect pressure can drive animals to move quite a bit. And then you're not just talking about the insects because then you also have to consider all of the factors that go into where those insects are at and why they're at the populations that they're at that are driving those movements. So you get many layers deep in the complexity of what's driving movement patterns in these different groups.",

So I wonder if it's possible that um that you know, just just the the mechanisms that underpin specific kinds of interactions that are say or specific times of kinds of movement that are salient to disease should be it might be useful to focus more on those as opposed to like movement writ large, you know, because I'm not sure if we need all of movement to understand the salient portions for disease.

We take these hosts, we don't, you know, like when I work on megafauna, right? So we catch an animal, we get one cross-sectional sample, we can we're not calibrated to forecast disease dynamics well or or internal state well within the animal. And so we don't know how susceptibility is varying. So I think that in my mind at least the information gaps surrounding where everyone else is and what's actually happening in the animal seem like way bigger um obstacles than improved remote sensing.

Um I feel like the risk of migration to seating new infections in new areas is really dependent on what the infectious period of the pathogen is, right? So if I'm a a migratory bird and I start my spring migration for something like West Nile virus, which is infectious for about a week, like I'm not going to make it to, you know, Alaska for example and and spread the virus there to a new mosquito, but you know, depending on how long I'm infectious where I might make it further or not. Um and and the point about again, sorry, sorry, harp on migration bit, but the point about radar detection I think is a really exciting area for at least getting a sense of um when animals leave or when they arrive, right? We can pick that up now on our radar systems and so that's I think a really promising area for making larger scale forecasts than we could based on the idea of, you know, let's put lightweight tags on every single bird or bat or something that we can.",

But I agree that you said the big challenge is how can you translate from individual studies and and settings to a trend of mobility, exposure and and I guess emergence. Um and there are good studies. We did work with uh dogs in Tanzania trying to understand how SIV is jumping from domestic animals to chimpanzees. So we had to individually track all the dogs and see that they had common areas in the, you know, crop area next to the park where the chimpanzees are going and the dogs are meeting. So maybe it's not that much individual animals, but it's patterns that lead you to areas where these encounters occur and that's what really you should care about, you know, more than the individual tracks.",

So that's something I've been debating. It seems maybe there's a question of scale in the kind of like how you model and understand the movement process. Like if you go really fine scale, it seems you'll have a lot more actionable information and like maybe how to like you'll be able to build disease modeling on disease models on top of it and predict and even simulate different management. But it seems if we're if we're trying to even go at well, where will the next uh uh zone zone just like emerge in the global south. I don't think maybe we don't need uh like really fine scale understanding of movement and it's more almost a distribution problem like species distribution and like overlap with humans type of question that we need to to get at.",

The other thing I I kind of hear everyone kind of also sort of maybe almost using that as a reference point but stretching toward this idea, you know, toward the the fuzzier picture of you know, what types of data, what framework do we need for a you know, maybe something in the context of much larger scale, continental to global surveillance. And you know, I I kind of feel like what you're reaching for there is some level of abstraction. Because when you when you get up there, you're not going to be dealing with individual animals. You know, it's not going to be I think as we all recognize, it's not going to be feasible to track every single animal on the continent. But you know, what what is it that would be the most useful? You know, would it be, you know, just throwing out one example off the top of my head, is it, you know, much better uh, you know, detailed maps of key migration routes, being able to understand, you know, the timing of migration, how they might light up earlier or later in different years.

I mean there's thousands of thousands of animals um and people who are working them on a daily basis. And then wildlife I'd be concerned with hunters, um hunters interaction with animals, possibilities for disease transmission.

Um, and it really, you know, makes me think about how, you know, climate and different things are changing and they're um, you know, we're getting more of these natural disasters and they're they're coming and they're changing everything that we've known or that has been stable over the time. Um, and, you know, how how are we going to be able to understand or predict we can we're not going to be able to tell necessarily that um, you know, there's going to be a drought here or there's going to be a wildfire that's going to make all the animals run out or, you know, different things like that. But if we can understand how their movements change during those um, times and and that's I I don't know. I think so in my group at the lab we do a lot with machine learning and it's very hard for me to to step away from that right now, but um, I think the more examples of different scenarios and and data that we can get to kind of feed the models to help them understand how things change and what those um, changes will do, I think will end up much more successful. Um, I don't think we need constant monitoring of everything, but I think if we have a good baseline in most of the um, circumstances that could happen which is, you know, hard to do because natural events aren't predictable um, to know to tag all those animals at that time. predict the unpredictable.

So if you kind of imagine it where you have, you know, a bunch of like like nodes on the landscape. Maybe they're farms um or ponds or something that's very discrete where you can say, well, we have something happening within these within this farm. Um but then we might not necessarily know what's happening within that farm or maybe we don't care all that much about finding the details what's happening within that farm. But understanding the connectivity between those nodes is something that would be slightly more feasible. Um both from obviously from a farm standpoint that's very feasible because you know what cows moving from farm A to farm B. But then also in wildlife if you if you have a population that's structured like that more of a kind of standard meta population. Um you can use, you know, potentially genetic tools where you only need to sample a few individuals to understand something about connectivity between those nodes. But that begins I think to break down when you don't have that like nice partitioning, which in a lot of wildlife systems you don't. So then I'm then I think that scale becomes harder to bridge. But I think there's some cases where you could bridge that scale by sort of saying, well, I don't care too much what's happening within the node, maybe things are generally well mixed, but I can use targeted surveillance to figure out what's happening kind of between nodes.",

And so I don't think necessarily that we need to um, you know, come up with one solution, how do you deal with the the middle man. there's a potential of, you know, looking at the smaller scale and that feeding into something that's looking at the higher scale. Um, just for example, um, you know, the things that I'm working on, the machine learning models are able to determine when a disease may appear in a location first, but it doesn't really tell you anything about how it's going to move and things like that. And so then you apply, you know, some type of say mechanistic model that can um help you better understand those patterns there.",
