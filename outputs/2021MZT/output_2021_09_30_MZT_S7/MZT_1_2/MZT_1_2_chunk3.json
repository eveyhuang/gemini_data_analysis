Um and so if you think about your like your your simplest situation where you have individuals just sort of moving randomly in some area, we have a very predictable contact pattern that emerges from that. Um but we sort of we sort of realize that in some cases that's not how animals are actually moving. And so what what do those what do those contact patterns actually look like and how do they link back to movement? I guess it's kind of what I was saying.",

So I wonder if it's possible that um that you know, just just the the mechanisms that underpin specific kinds of interactions that are say or specific times of kinds of movement that are salient to disease should be it might be useful to focus more on those as opposed to like movement writ large, you know, because I'm not sure if we need all of movement to understand the salient portions for disease.

It is our ability to wall to wall collar everybody or alternatively to be able to predict contact in some other way. And then also we need a better handle on what's going on within the host, right? We take these hosts, we don't, you know, like when I work on megafauna, right? So we catch an animal, we get one cross-sectional sample, we can we're not calibrated to forecast disease dynamics well or or internal state well within the animal. And so we don't know how susceptibility is varying. So I think that in my mind at least the information gaps surrounding where everyone else is and what's actually happening in the animal seem like way bigger um obstacles than improved remote sensing. However, maybe there's a way to remotely sense moving animals without instrumenting them. That would be awesome.",

Um I feel like the risk of migration to seating new infections in new areas is really dependent on what the infectious period of the pathogen is, right? So if I'm a a migratory bird and I start my spring migration for something like West Nile virus, which is infectious for about a week, like I'm not going to make it to, you know, Alaska for example and and spread the virus there to a new mosquito, but you know, depending on how long I'm infectious where I might make it further or not. Um and and the point about again, sorry, sorry, harp on migration bit, but the point about radar detection I think is a really exciting area for at least getting a sense of um when animals leave or when they arrive, right? We can pick that up now on our radar systems and so that's I think a really promising area for making larger scale forecasts than we could based on the idea of, you know, let's put lightweight tags on every single bird or bat or something that we can.",

And I wish there was a way that we could track individual animals based on the blood meals in these mosquitoes because I think I know like in the Everglades, they've done this where they've detected the presence of certain critters that they're looking for because they're looking at these blood meals and it helps them to monitor the populations that are present. So I mean, I think there is a possibility with using blood engorged insects to do some degree of monitoring, but I don't know how useful that is for small scale movement.",

But I agree that you said the big challenge is how can you translate from individual studies and and settings to a trend of mobility, exposure and and I guess emergence. Um and there are good studies. We did work with uh dogs in Tanzania trying to understand how SIV is jumping from domestic animals to chimpanzees. So we had to individually track all the dogs and see that they had common areas in the, you know, crop area next to the park where the chimpanzees are going and the dogs are meeting. So maybe it's not that much individual animals, but it's patterns that lead you to areas where these encounters occur and that's what really you should care about, you know, more than the individual tracks.",
