The fact that well, maybe from a disease emergence standpoint, it's being able to detect where we're seeing a, you know, some type of a disturbance or a perturbation that's leading to a, you know, a shift in these contact patterns that uh, you know, could, you know, could provide the impetus for spillover events.",

And I'm kind of curious is it you know, maybe that's because that middle, you know, that middle part and the connections is uh the hardest part. But I I'm curious if anyone has any thoughts or insights on kind of bridging that gap and making the connection between local knowledge and research to uh, you know, to informing broad uh practical broader scale uh surveillance uh strategies.",

            "transcript": "I don't think this quite answers that question. Um that's a really good question. Um I I think one of the challenges with that is sort of how you partition your scales. So if you kind of imagine it where you have, you know, a bunch of like like nodes on the landscape. Maybe they're farms um or ponds or something that's very discrete where you can say, well, we have something happening within these within this farm. Um but then we might not necessarily know what's happening within that farm or maybe we don't care all that much about finding the details what's happening within that farm. But understanding the connectivity between those nodes is something that would be slightly more feasible. Um both from obviously from a farm standpoint that's very feasible because you know what cows moving from farm A to farm B. But then also in wildlife if you if you have a population that's structured like that more of a kind of standard meta population. Um you can use, you know, potentially genetic tools where you only need to sample a few individuals to understand something about connectivity between those nodes. But that begins I think to break down when you don't have that like nice partitioning, which in a lot of wildlife systems you don't. So then I'm then I think that scale becomes harder to bridge. But I think there's some cases where you could bridge that scale by sort of saying, well, I don't care too much what's happening within the node, maybe things are generally well mixed, but I can use targeted surveillance to figure out what's happening kind of between nodes.",

Basically, um, you know, when thinking about the different types of models, whether it's a statistical model or a mechanistic model or a um, you know, machine learning model, they all have their strengths, right? And so I don't think necessarily that we need to um, you know, come up with one solution, how do you deal with the the middle man. there's a potential of, you know, looking at the smaller scale and that feeding into something that's looking at the higher scale. Um, just for example, um, you know, the things that I'm working on, the machine learning models are able to determine when a disease may appear in a location first, but it doesn't really tell you anything about how it's going to move and things like that. And so then you apply, you know, some type of say mechanistic model that can um help you better understand those patterns there.",
