            "transcript": "uh the complexities of a local disease transmission cycle. Um often, you know, the specific characteristics of that will not extrapolate to other areas, but I think there's a big potential for gaining a better understanding of important mechanisms that are, you know, that are often broadly more important beyond an individual system. The other thing I I kind of hear everyone kind of also sort of maybe almost using that as a reference point but stretching toward this idea, you know, toward the the fuzzier picture of you know, what types of data, what framework do we need for a you know, maybe something in the context of much larger scale, continental to global surveillance. And you know, I I kind of feel like what you're reaching for there is some level of abstraction. Because when you when you get up there, you're not going to be dealing with individual animals. You know, it's not going to be I think as we all recognize, it's not going to be feasible to track every single animal on the continent. But you know, what what is it that would be the most useful? You know, would it be, you know, just throwing out one example off the top of my head, is it, you know, much better uh, you know, detailed maps of key migration routes, being able to understand, you know, the timing of migration, how they might light up earlier or later in different years. Um, you know, when particular species might be moving, how those might be shifting from year to year. So, uh anyway, I I just wanted to try to um, you know, try to frame some of those ideas in terms of where I hear you all going. But uh, I'll kind of put it back to the the group now.",

I mean we like to focus on focus on the animals, but I know a lot of the time like these animals are very close contact with humans whether it's the people working the animals or the people bleeding the animals for, you know, or doing testing, TB testing. I mean there's thousands of thousands of animals um and people who are working them on a daily basis. And then wildlife I'd be concerned with hunters, um hunters interaction with animals, possibilities for disease transmission. I know like brucelosis case there was a hunter who made cut his skin while he was field dressing the deer and so I think there's a lot of different interaction points to take into consideration.

Um, I was I was thinking something different, but um, about kind of because you were talking about, you know, would having, you know, finer grained migration patterns or or, you know, something like that would that help. Um, and it really, you know, makes me think about how, you know, climate and different things are changing and they're um, you know, we're getting more of these natural disasters and they're they're coming and they're changing everything that we've known or that has been stable over the time. Um, and, you know, how how are we going to be able to understand or predict we can we're not going to be able to tell necessarily that um, you know, there's going to be a drought here or there's going to be a wildfire that's going to make all the animals run out or, you know, different things like that. But if we can understand how their movements change during those um, times and and that's I I don't know. I think so in my group at the lab we do a lot with machine learning and it's very hard for me to to step away from that right now, but um, I think the more examples of different scenarios and and data that we can get to kind of feed the models to help them understand how things change and what those um, changes will do, I think will end up much more successful. Um, I don't think we need constant monitoring of everything, but I think if we have a good baseline in most of the um, circumstances that could happen which is, you know, hard to do because natural events aren't predictable um, to know to tag all those animals at that time. predict the unpredictable. Right. Exactly. Chaos theory. Um, so yeah, I don't know. That was that's that's what what I was thinking when you said that.",

As long as it's a good quality blood meal if it's partially digested already then you're probably not going to get a good match, but um, I've done thousands of them and you you get very high quality matches.",
