Like what what does that give us? we just did it in one population, is that useful?

If we had the ideal movement data, then you add in the disease on top of it, we could potentially more accurately understand what is going to happen actually happen when a disease gets introduced. Um, it will also help us understand control measures that could be used and put in place if we, you know, see hot areas of where um, you know, there's a lot of interface between humans and animals or the high risk animals, um, I think that would be important as well as um say understanding I think we would also need to know um have some sort of surveillance and understanding of what the disease is the the relative amount in those populations um in addition to, you know, the normal disease parameters.",

Um if we can, you know, categorize enough of that train the models to understand those nuances that we we aren't able to um, you know, pick out ourselves, which is traditionally how statistical models are run, you know, we say these are the things we're thinking about and this is how they play. Um, these other types of models are able to understand those nuances, take other types of data, um, you know, whether they're correlated or not and really um point to better picture as to what's going on and make it generalizable um to apply like we've we did tests on different countries that we've never even seen the data.

I guess I think of it from the end, we have this data and then if something happens, we're going to be able to use that data in a backwards like a trace back kind of fashion and say where did this occur. So you don't necessarily start here and go here, but you're working backward and I think that data that you have will become more relevant over time as long as you're collecting at enough data points and enough information to help you with that trace back because a lot of the time like when when I do animal disease investigations, I'm like, okay, where did this animal go? Of course, they're all supposed to be officially identified with RFID tags, so they're supposed to be traceable. Um, and that's that's just the kind of way we approach it.",

So that's something I've been debating. It seems maybe there's a question of scale in the kind of like how you model and understand the movement process. Like if you go really fine scale, it seems you'll have a lot more actionable information and like maybe how to like you'll be able to build disease modeling on disease models on top of it and predict and even simulate different management. But it seems if we're if we're trying to even go at well, where will the next uh uh zone zone just like emerge in the global south. I don't think maybe we don't need uh like really fine scale understanding of movement and it's more almost a distribution problem like species distribution and like overlap with humans type of question that we need to to get at.",

And and I don't really other than my my really real interest for animal movement, I don't really need much like very detailed information about animal movement. I just need to know actually if I have a a huge density of these populations in an area or not. So I think you're you're you're bringing a very good point that um maybe our efforts um which which because colors are expensive, you know, tracking detailed animal movement is very expensive and maybe I don't know. are they really necessary from a disease point of view?",
