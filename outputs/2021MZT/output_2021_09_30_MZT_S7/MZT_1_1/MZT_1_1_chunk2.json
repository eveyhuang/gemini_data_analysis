Um, my actually like Tavis, I have a little bit of a background in marine biology. So I did my PhD studying the evolutionary genetics of corals. Then I moved to study pathogens, mainly viruses, also some bacteria and fungi using evolutionary genetics and genomic epidemiology to study their spread. And then recently I've been using genomic technologies to move into the realm of highly multiplex serology. So looking at thousands to hundreds of thousands of antigens in a single assay and broadly characterizing antibody reactivity. And I'm excited to start looking at that within wildlife and at that human animal interface. Uh unfortunately, I'm going to have to run and teach basically now. Um so I'm going to miss most of this first discussion, but it was nice to meet everyone and I look forward to uh meeting up with you later.",

Again, um to go over the um the evolution, coevolution, the things again, can we track specific traits that identify organism organisms at at risk for spillover and what role does commensalism and mutualism play in the feedback between the pathogens and hosts and vectors, types of cross scale feedback occurs during emergence and transmission and in the case of phylodynamics, how can we model population sizes to estimate the magnitude of potential outbreaks and issues related to dominant variants or uh shifty populations of strain variation. So those were just topics that were suggested, but you you all can take it anywhere. So I'm going to throw it open again. I'm going to kind of step back and you know, please have the dialogue of what you think would be potential projects or areas that you could work on. Um and you heard everybody so far, they want you to be creative, think out of the box and and don't be afraid, you know, if to take risks or suggest something that might not have been done before.",

And something that I always think about is like I can get, you know, data on the infections, I can get data on, you know, immune parameters and stuff and but like what does that tell us? Like if you have a highly defended host or like, you know, they have high white blood cells, does that mean that they're sick? Does that mean that they are like ready to go or even if you look at it like from at evolutionary lineages, if something we can infer it's been under strong pathogen driven selection, does that make it any more or less likely to be a reservoir for infections? Does that mean like, oh, it's been under the strong pressure or maybe it's like really equipped and it pretty healthy. So I and with all this viral screening data and sort of data about hosts, what does that actually mean for spillover? So that first prompt might have been from one of my pre conference surveys.",

So those amplification hosts actually will produce more variants and if those variants are there then evolution can select for them to jump into another host. So I I I'm really interested in how these different systems can generate diversity uh itself. Um and and increase risk. I wasn't quite sure what they meant in that in that first question with tracking those traits, those host specific traits, uh what the at risk animal was? Like was that the at risk as being the source or at risk for being the sink and recipient of uh of the the pathogen. Yeah. Yeah, I think could be all the above. Yeah, I.",
