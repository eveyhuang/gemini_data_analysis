If you have a whole lot of variants out there, if you've got more and more of them then there's the increased probability that one of those is going to have the capacity to to spill over and infect a novel host potentially. So from from an intervention perspective then it's controlling the number of variants that you have within the course of infection and then that establishes the next infection within your host population. So trying to minimize variants over time. And so that got me thinking about host effects. And if we just remove all of our biases and ecological knowledge and biological knowledge and this goes to one of Kim's points, um so removing all of the the stuff that makes us love biology potentially, the details and just looking at a box and saying this is the box and this is the box in which a virus or a bacteria replicates.

So the secondary bacterial infections that they may may then take off antibiotic resistance stuff. And how can we then think about those transient dynamics and rare events and model those. So that was mostly me just rambling about the things that I'm thinking about trying to get out get out that bigger idea of how can we minimize the cloud of variance and if we minimize that cloud of variance, we might minimize the probability of spillover and emergence. And it could be done by thinking about the immune response within an individual host and how that impacts within host evolution and then between host evolution. And we may not need to have really highly parameterized models. We could just say this host has an immune response to this pathogen and then what happens subsequently.

There's really no uh standing immunity that's built in the population. Uh there's for a lot of these animals it's just constant turnover. Even with even with pigs, right? That they're constantly turned over. So you don't actually get a strong immune selection to reduce that diversity um that that happens uh at that after jump. But this relative differences in immune selection I I think is something that we know very little about beyond the individual scale. At the population scale, we we really don't know much about it and we don't know much about it uh between different populations either. We just sort of we like from my side we'll look at a phylogenetic tree and say the shape of the tree it's clearly because of immune selection and then maybe move on.

        "utterance": "Kim Pepin, NWRC (USDA): the different within host immune factors and what they mean in terms of traits. So, you know, we know and I mean like epidemiological or evolutionary traits of a pathogen. So if we think about the epidemiology side, we know that, you know, high host growth rates, you know, can lead to more transmission and therefore more viral replication and more genetic diversity. Um, and then we have this other side of things which is these immune factors that, you know, might cause bad physiological conditions in the host. So worse replication for the virus, not as much genetic diversity. And then we have these other situations where you get a high immune response and so there's like a strong immunity pressure, strong selection. So these kinds of I I thought about these questions like way back during my PhD with is there can we predict evolution based on environmental conditions. So if you have a situation that, you know, the pathogen can't propagate in very well, but a hard selection pressure, are there fewer ways to adapt in that context than if you're able to replicate to high rates, um, and maybe selection is weak. Um, so I just started thinking, you know, more recently I've been working in the world of epidemiology and thinking about all of the ecological processes and then folks who keep on the um evolutionary side, I still feel like these fields are a little bit siloed and our techniques, you know, the file dynamics have really been trying to bring in the demographics into um inference about evolution. But there's so much more to do, like we're still not really bringing in like the um environmental conditions and these different selection pressures that are in the environment as well as we could, you know, because like when we want when we want to go about predicting, you know, out there, where should we look for or where where is the high risk for an emerging disease, we got to be able to link these environmental conditions to this these evolutionary processes and I feel like that's kind of what we're missing. So I really I think what Hannah suggested in trying to understand, you know, what host immune factors should we be looking for. If we can be able to correlate those host immune factors to different within host conditions that affect the virus evolution, it seems like that's a good sort of avenue of questioning. Um, and I was thinking like it would be nice to sort of like list very broadly because I'm not an immunologist, but I've tried to dabble in like immunologist data and I'm like this is so confusing. Um, but like if an immunologist could tell me like, oh, when I get this reading, essentially that means the immune system is primed and there's like strong selection on the virus. Um, versus like when I get this reading, the host is super stressed out, it's not good conditions for viral replication. You know, then we could have these real basic traits that we could be putting in epidemiological models that are directly correlated to effects on viral evolution. ",

But there's the more we know, the the clearer that this is just, you know, one of the millions hurdles that these organisms have to. So I think like looking at it from a holistic perspective on both sides, right? You know, a the the most random factor in the environment might be actually selecting for some traits that we don't really know have a major advantage in in colonizing the host. Again, we know that if you can, you know, avoid getting, you know, immune cells to detect you, that's a that's a wonderful thing if you want to kill us. But how about, you know, Sarah mentioned metabolic processes. Uh, how about the ability to use some some um, some nutrients and out compete things like the microbiota because you know, these guys if you want to colonize the gut, there's been somebody living there way longer than you. So you you have to take care of that as well. So there's like um, so this kind of juncture, right? juncture of what do you need to become a pathogen and what is giving you those traits in in the environment, you know, the training ground basically. So I I think that you know that kind of I it was useful that uh Kim mentioned that right after Sarah. So I think those two are one and the same, right? Uh two sides of the same coin. ",

Uh and then there could be different things taken at each at each spatial scale and at each of those scales we could run file dynamic analysis as well. So in Justin's web for example, or with collaborators here, we can take an individual Petri dish that's made up of a layer of cells and infect that layer of cells and then sequence everything that is within that cell, that that cell layer and then do phylogenetics on that. And a broader scale then we can look at individual animals and and do sequencing during the course of infection and look at phylodynamics there across the herd and then across populations and scale there um with a targeted study. Uh and then look at each of those levels, try and control predictive variables that we believe are are important in driving the evolutionary dynamics of these viruses. So within individual Petri dishes we could do a heat wave treatment or a nutrient limitation treatment. Somebody mentioned energy limitation in one of the their studies, I think it might have been Sarah. You know the idea we've got there an Eltonian pyramid, right? Where you've got restriction of energy all the way up and then viruses and bacteria filtering off that energy at different traffic levels. But the the idea would be that we could manipulate abiotic environments at each of those different spatial scales and then have targeted sequencing at each of those scales as well and track the evolutionary dynamics with the prediction that at particular time points there's going to be these clouds of variants that uh can emerge and spill over and cause pandemics.

Um and then most of those oaks when there's a mass year, they fall right around that that's a curve, right? So most of the oak acorns are falling right around the base of the tree. And then there's one of those acorns that gets grabbed by a little squirrel and then dashes off and that seeds that next big oak tree that forms the forest. So how can we capture that dynamic with our pathogens and pandemics? Do we just apply plant dispersal curves to pandemics or do we come up with a different framework theoretically and think about it that way? I don't know. The rare events with long distance dispersal.
