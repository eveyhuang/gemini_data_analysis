            "transcript": "And then there's also the order and timing of how these things happen. So if you get infected by something at point A, what happens at point B if you're challenged by a subtly different pathogen. So when we think about the swine respiratory disease complex and this was a Justin point, this enormous cloud not just of influenza, but of RSV, of other viruses and then bacterial infections. So the secondary bacterial infections that they may may then take off antibiotic resistance stuff. And how can we then think about those transient dynamics and rare events and model those. So that was mostly me just rambling about the things that I'm thinking about trying to get out get out that bigger idea of how can we minimize the cloud of variance and if we minimize that cloud of variance, we might minimize the probability of spillover and emergence. And it could be done by thinking about the immune response within an individual host and how that impacts within host evolution and then between host evolution. And we may not need to have really highly parameterized models. We could just say this host has an immune response to this pathogen and then what happens subsequently. And then you could run evolutionary models on that or or network based models or landscape based models as well potentially. So that's my two two cents there.",

            "transcript": "Great. uh yeah, I I think with my comment on immunity before was really on the recipient in a in a inter species transmission event. But sort of extending on what what uh Tavis just said is that if you have these animals this animal population like a domestic population, domestic chickens are not alive very long. There's really no uh standing immunity that's built in the population. Uh there's for a lot of these animals it's just constant turnover. Even with even with pigs, right? That they're constantly turned over. So you don't actually get a strong immune selection to reduce that diversity um that that happens uh at that after jump. But this relative differences in immune selection I I think is something that we know very little about beyond the individual scale. At the population scale, we we really don't know much about it and we don't know much about it uh between different populations either. We just sort of we like from my side we'll look at a phylogenetic tree and say the shape of the tree it's clearly because of immune selection and then maybe move on. Um so yeah, I I think that was putting that on a on a larger scale at landscape and going from from individual to to uh uh between and then population. I I think that's a very interesting approach or suggestion.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I actually really like that idea as well that Tavis had because there are uh I think it's not just like looking at how much immune response there is, but also like uh are we seeing a different sub cell of cells coming into like where infection is happening because what happens between a species and we don't think about it is that we don't all have the same immune cells. We don't all have the same population of like the same immune response. So how is the immune response in animal one different from animal two that in animal one they can serve as a reservoir whereas in uh animal uh two they don't serve as a reservoir and why is this happening is it because there are different innate immune responses and different cell populations.",

Um I also had some experiences in meeting with other diverse scientists looking at the intersection of energy and information and that nexus and how that informs what happens to organisms and how systems are. And um so the question of fitness flexibility is what I look at because I'm looking at a parasite so that's uni or or multi I'm looking at a unicellular parasite that it's more complicated than a viral system that I understand that a lot of you are looking at. So this what I have to say may be partially applicable.",

So what I'm wondering is if it's possible to develop um some sort of I I guess um uh some some sort of modeling based on some tests that we might be able to do in the laboratory about how flexible organisms are in terms of their metabolism, how flexible organisms are in terms of their ability to withstand various things that a system could throw at them in terms of immune response and.",
