Uh, so I think both of them are part of the of the risk of that spillover and they both are going to uh represent different pressures, right? Because you would think that the first animal that normally gets infected, let's say like a bat, uh, they have a different immune response than a pig. So like what Justin was saying, because of that immune pressure, they are going to be different variants of the virus and that's why you see changes on the epito, right? You you you change you see changes in epito and you change see changes in receptor and that's when they then become able to infect humans. Like this is very well known like in influenza. In influenza the the influenza virus has the the per influenza has to pass through pigs in order to be able to infect humans. So we do know that there are pressures. We just don't know like to what extent these pressures uh are necessary for the for these pathogens to then spill over to humans.",

It's not necessarily telling us what is going what is happening with that that jump. Uh but from the genome sequencing, if we could do deep sequencing within a within the reservoir host and compare it to the sync host, then that might just tell us, hey, there has been selection there.

And then so we can have a more extensive um, you know, genomic surveillance of all those different reservoirs and potential amplification hosts. Um, I think that's at least for me that's where epidemiology now is moving and then if we can extend this to non-human hosts, you know, because whole genome sequencing has been widely used for in in uh infections of humans, if we can you know, extend that to different animal hosts, that would be great.",

Um and obviously I'm I'm close to Justin's comments on on variants. it sounds like there's like a sampling effect. If you have a whole lot of variants out there, if you've got more and more of them then there's the increased probability that one of those is going to have the capacity to to spill over and infect a novel host potentially. So from from an intervention perspective then it's controlling the number of variants that you have within the course of infection and then that establishes the next infection within your host population. So trying to minimize variants over time. And so that got me thinking about host effects. And if we just remove all of our biases and ecological knowledge and biological knowledge and this goes to one of Kim's points, um so removing all of the the stuff that makes us love biology potentially, the details and just looking at a box and saying this is the box and this is the box in which a virus or a bacteria replicates. What I'm what impacts that replication process and transmission process within the individual host between hosts and then across the landscape. And identifying the core drivers that may be influencing those dynamics because all of those dynamics are going to impact that huge cloud of variants that emerges.",
