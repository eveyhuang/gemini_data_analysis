You you you can find uh microorganisms that have a clonal offshoot that only a tiny little subset of a tiny little subset can cause disease in humans and then you have the crazy ones where, you know, you have pathogenic isolates, you know, popping out of every single cluster or or clay and the one that's next to it cannot really uh harm um in in our case some other vertebrate hosts. So uh I I I think that that that question could be kind of like slightly modified in why some only one and why some they are scattered all over the place because it it doesn't seem to be that you know, the only way to do it is if you have some sort of like, you know, phylogenomic uh conservation because some are insanely conserved and some are insanely divergent.

There's some um theoretical advancements that could be done, but I also think it would help to to collaborate with the folks who understand those data sources really well. Um, but but in terms of like he was just saying, let's try to make some theoretical advances in maybe geographic or dynamic methods, like they provide a really good platform for incorporating other data streams, but we haven't done that yet and there needs to be some theoretical advancements for us to incorporate those data. So it's a little bit, you know, like I was saying earlier, a lot of times we think we need to collect data uh before we do the modeling. At least that's the the cultural view in the in my agency and the folks I work with. But you know, if we have data in hand that we have no frameworks to use and don't know how to incorporate, then there's going to be a giant lag before we actually use that data and know if it's useful. So I think there's a project here in trying to propose some theoretical advancements that could um incorporate some of these new data streams that haven't been incorporated in existing approaches like the dynamic frameworks and what not.",

Is that possible? And then possibly even, you know, extend that again to what about some of those um vectors that could also be considered parasites or, you know, or pathogens and or or the unicellular or multicellular ones. So, um, so it looks like there's it feels to me like there's two different places the theory can advance. One is just uniting that those those things that we haven't thought to add in those environmental factors or or whatever.",
