            "transcript": "the different within host immune factors and what they mean in terms of traits. So, you know, we know and I mean like epidemiological or evolutionary traits of a pathogen. So if we think about the epidemiology side, we know that, you know, high host growth rates, you know, can lead to more transmission and therefore more viral replication and more genetic diversity. Um, and then we have this other side of things which is these immune factors that, you know, might cause bad physiological conditions in the host. So worse replication for the virus, not as much genetic diversity. And then we have these other situations where you get a high immune response and so there's like a strong immunity pressure, strong selection. So these kinds of I I thought about these questions like way back during my PhD with is there can we predict evolution based on environmental conditions. So if you have a situation that, you know, the pathogen can't propagate in very well, but a hard selection pressure, are there fewer ways to adapt in that context than if you're able to replicate to high rates, um, and maybe selection is weak. Um, so I just started thinking, you know, more recently I've been working in the world of epidemiology and thinking about all of the ecological processes and then folks who keep on the um evolutionary side, I still feel like these fields are a little bit siloed and our techniques, you know, the file dynamics have really been trying to bring in the demographics into um inference about evolution. But there's so much more to do, like we're still not really bringing in like the um environmental conditions and these different selection pressures that are in the environment as well as we could, you know, because like when we want when we want to go about predicting, you know, out there, where should we look for or where where is the high risk for an emerging disease, we got to be able to link these environmental conditions to this these evolutionary processes and I feel like that's kind of what we're missing. So I really I think what Hannah suggested in trying to understand, you know, what host immune factors should we be looking for. If we can be able to correlate those host immune factors to different within host conditions that affect the virus evolution, it seems like that's a good sort of avenue of questioning. Um, and I was thinking like it would be nice to sort of like list very broadly because I'm not an immunologist, but I've tried to dabble in like immunologist data and I'm like this is so confusing. Um, but like if an immunologist could tell me like, oh, when I get this reading, essentially that means the immune system is primed and there's like strong selection on the virus. Um, versus like when I get this reading, the host is super stressed out, it's not good conditions for viral replication. You know, then we could have these real basic traits that we could be putting in epidemiological models that are directly correlated to effects on viral evolution.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, because I I think it's really nice that uh basically what Kim just mentioned and what Sarah mentioned, it's kind of like I I wanted to bring both of them within what the context of a understanding, you know, the the the ecological drivers, but also this kind of like um, you know, dark matter of of what it takes to be a pathogen and we understand that immune evasion is you know, the bread and butter of how to kill a human. But there's the more we know, the the clearer that this is just, you know, one of the millions hurdles that these organisms have to. So I think like looking at it from a holistic perspective on both sides, right? You know, a the the most random factor in the environment might be actually selecting for some traits that we don't really know have a major advantage in in colonizing the host. Again, we know that if you can, you know, avoid getting, you know, immune cells to detect you, that's a that's a wonderful thing if you want to kill us. But how about, you know, Sarah mentioned metabolic processes. Uh, how about the ability to use some some um, some nutrients and out compete things like the microbiota because you know, these guys if you want to colonize the gut, there's been somebody living there way longer than you. So you you have to take care of that as well. So there's like um, so this kind of juncture, right? juncture of what do you need to become a pathogen and what is giving you those traits in in the environment, you know, the training ground basically. So I I think that you know that kind of I it was useful that uh Kim mentioned that right after Sarah. So I think those two are one and the same, right? Uh two sides of the same coin.",
