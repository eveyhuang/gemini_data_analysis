Um, I'm a modeler. I've worked on these kinds of problems like emerging disease um for many years from the modeling side, but I actually started out I did my PhD in experimental evolution, so evolutionary biology with a virus model system. So although lately I've been focusing more on the modeling the epidemiology and the ecological processes. I have a strong foundation and interest in evolutionary processes as well. So especially like drivers of host jumps, um, what sort of environmental environmental factors drive viral adaptation. So I kind of wanted to join this group because I would like to get these pieces sort of back into my current research.",
