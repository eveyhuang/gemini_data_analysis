So is that a big challenge like you know, the models are working well.",

Um I didn't want to make this whole conversation about vectors so I've tried to hold back on the uh the vector side of things just a little bit. But one thing that people are using a little bit more is called um Xeno surveillance. So you know, insects, especially biting insects tend to approach animals and they don't typically care too much if your animal is sick or not. In fact, a sick animal is an easier host to bite on, right? So you have insects that are going out and blood feeding and landing on and interacting with animals in the field all the time.",

If they've taken a blood meal and they have virus in that blood, you can detect the virus in the blood even if it's not a vector born disease.
