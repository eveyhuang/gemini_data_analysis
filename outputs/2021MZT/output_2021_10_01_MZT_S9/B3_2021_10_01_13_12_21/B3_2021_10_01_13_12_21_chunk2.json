So have a real interest in diagnostics, the surveillance and detection of diseases and um, so appreciate the chance to join this group. I also am the APHIS lead to work on the National Bio and Agro Defense facility. So as we look at having the new facility in the future. So and really enjoyed your presentation yesterday. Thank you.",

I can't even believe how like almost goes through the full life cycle of what we might consider in terms of tackling those challenges in surveillance. Um, the way we do this and Peter, please correct and chime in. I mean we're not going to have time to tackle all these questions. It's much better if we um, if we just pick one or two that we want to really focus on and then bring in the others as is helpful. Um, and I think it helps for us to have um a little bit of think time as well. So um,",

I think those are the emerging pathogen surveillance is really challenging. We might want to include like what what we could do it as far as what's already known. We've got some key like literally agency people who are looking for help trying to detect SARS COV2 in animal reservoirs. That is a huge challenge. Um, super rare. Um, what do we want to say about that? There's already been really good points brought up like we're talking about sampling. So what do we do for sampling for rare diseases? How can we make it more efficient? Um, so please take a look at those questions and then um, maybe we can converge on on just, you know, one or two that I mean I think the first one is usual kind of covers it. It's very overarching and we can bring in the others. But let's let's take a pause and um and see what you think. Does anyone want to top up or or redirect?",
