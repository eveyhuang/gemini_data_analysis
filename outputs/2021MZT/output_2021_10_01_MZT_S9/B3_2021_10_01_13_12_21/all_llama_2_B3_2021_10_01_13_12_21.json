We've got some key like literally agency people who are looking for help trying to detect SARS COV2 in animal reservoirs. That is a huge challenge. Um, super rare.

But even with other companies like Pearl and Mars, those VCAs, those are each hospital is its own electronic medical record system and they don't even court like they don't even correspond with each other. And we're doing a national data set with dogs where we are asking for electronic medical records and it's shocking how many of these medical record systems can't even upload into a different system.
