Is it something that's um, uh, I'm rambling, but basically the point is does it really matter exactly what it is if we know how to treat it and we know how it's going to act in the host. Um, you know, that's that's kind of a question. I guess thinking about synthetic biology and all of the different things that um, can be made that aren't natural that aren't on our list of things that we're trying to identify um, based off of uh, you know, a list, you know, is it is it more worth um, trying to do that sort of threat agnostic approach and I'll stop talking.",

Um, and I think they also get human data and you can request those data um, from the Arbonet people. So, um, but the problem you run into is it's very biased collections because it's just wherever there's a lot of collecting going on and it doesn't give you a full picture of all of the disease transmission going on in the country. So.",

And and in these you know high level discussions it almost felt like it was a barrier more than a great idea. Uh and I think you know that's crucial because you know zonatic pathogen, especially if you are looking now at agricultural pathogens too and vector borne, you really have to have not only the public health surveillance which is in a way uh improving but also how do we link these two bubbles. And I and I believe that there is core interest in both public health and and and you know agricultural health of why we should need to integrate data sources, you know?",

And and oftentimes we don't have those data in the same place. Maybe we have human movement data uh to study human diseases. We may have some um animal movement data uh to study like uh animal diseases, but I I think sometimes we don't have the combined exposure history or likelihood of that.

Um, or are we do we need do we need the infected animals so we can get that sequence or that virus cultured out of that individual.

Um, and it it goes back to one of these questions which was on um urban animals. So, um, when we think about surveillance of animals, I think we always go to agricultural or, you know, the big wildlife, right? We don't look at the pets that are sleeping with us, you know, in bed with us or the urban wildlife, like the squirrels or the raccoons or all these things that are around us all of the time.
