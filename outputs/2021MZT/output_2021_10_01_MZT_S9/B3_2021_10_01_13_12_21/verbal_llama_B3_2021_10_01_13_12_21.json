We've got some key like literally agency people who are looking for help trying to detect SARS COV2 in animal reservoirs. That is a huge challenge. Um, super rare. Um, what do we want to say about that? There's already been really good points brought up like we're talking about sampling. So what do we do for sampling for rare diseases? How can we make it more efficient? Um, so please take a look at those questions and then um, maybe we can converge on on just, you know, one or two that I mean I think the first one is usual kind of covers it.
