Uh, you know, like if I am letting my pet outside, you know, I am informed that, you know, there is a chance I can get something from them. I might be willing to pay like 10, 15 dollars, not 300 dollars maybe.",

So, um, you know, I think about Banfield and how there are so many of them and they're all over. And to me, I was like, oh, they must have a surveillance system and, you know, they're they're able to tell each other. They don't even know within their own clinic what cases are going high and what's going on. Um, let alone between different clinics. So you could find out, but is that information going anywhere? Um, at this point in time, no. And it's not informing even just the vet community in a silo, it's not informing the human community, um, for sure. So",

In fact, it all gets uploaded at the end of the day, right? Like there is like a mainframe that collects the information from all across. But even with other companies like Pearl and Mars, those VCAs, those are each hospital is its own electronic medical record system and they don't even court like they don't even correspond with each other. And we're doing a national data set with dogs where we are asking for electronic medical records and it's shocking how many of these medical record systems can't even upload into a different system. Like it's we have a real data sharing issue.",

It seems that a lot of us um in a way moved into this idea of um sources that would be more uh broad for detection of pathogens given that we cannot um very likely detect specific um um things that we don't know, you know, they're emerging.",

Um, so I'm thinking like the the modeling frameworks and those kinds of tools because, you know, like when I think about optimizing surveillance, I think about it in an adaptive context where, you know, you have a model, your model predicts risk and then you can optimize your surveillance by focusing in on the places that are highest risk, go do surveillance there and it's this feedback mechanism. And that that modeling piece kind of needs to be developed on the front end as much as possible.",

Yeah, so and that's why I had brought up the um what's our sort of management objective with the surveillance system because you got to start with that in order to develop the modeling framework that you optimize over. And so I was going on the one that, okay, I what I want to optimize where I'm looking for like where I could find virus to analyze. So let's say I have this surveillance system that's opportunistic with collecting serology and I can use that in a model to predict where I'm most likely to find um I don't know, I guess antibodies and animals and I might then assume that that might lead me to virus and then when I've actually find virus, I update the model to say, okay, now I have more information about where I'm actually going to find virus that I can sequence.",
