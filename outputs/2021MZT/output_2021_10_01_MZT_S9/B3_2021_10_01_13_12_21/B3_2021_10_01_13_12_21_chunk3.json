I do one health epidemiology and one of the things that we talk about in one health is animals and other things we talk about is humans. we typically leave out the environmental piece, which is actually where most of that transmission is occurring. And so I think that um I would really like for that surveillance optimization conversation to include more holistically an environmental piece, not just vectors, but also water and soil and fecal contaminants and you know, those types of things too because I think that there's a lot of um zosis that are being spread through um environmental impact environmental drivers rather than actual direct contact between animals and humans.",
