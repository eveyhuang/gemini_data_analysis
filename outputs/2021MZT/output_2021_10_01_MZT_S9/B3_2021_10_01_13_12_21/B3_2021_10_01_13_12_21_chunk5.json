Um and it's being transmitted detected for a long time, but hey, there is an invasive tick species that not only will be a more competent vector, but it will actually sanguinate domestic, you know, cattle, you know, sheep. So the whole ecology could change from the addition of a vector that is not necessarily even changing uh bringing its pathogen is actually changing the ecology of the pathogens uh that already circulate.",

Or other times we want to have a surveillance system because we want to be able to figure out how we're going to best respond when we get a detection or other times we want to be able to understand, you know, how is this pathogen transmitting?
