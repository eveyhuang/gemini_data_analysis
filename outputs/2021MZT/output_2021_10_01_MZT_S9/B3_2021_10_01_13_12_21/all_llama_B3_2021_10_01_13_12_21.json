We've got some key like literally agency people who are looking for help trying to detect SARS COV2 in animal reservoirs. That is a huge challenge. Um, super rare. Um, what do we want to say about that? There's already been really good points brought up like we're talking about sampling. So what do we do for sampling for rare diseases? How can we make it more efficient?

In fact, it all gets uploaded at the end of the day, right? Like there is like a mainframe that collects the information from all across. But even with other companies like Pearl and Mars, those VCAs, those are each hospital is its own electronic medical record system and they don't even court like they don't even correspond with each other. And we're doing a national data set with dogs where we are asking for electronic medical records and it's shocking how many of these medical record systems can't even upload into a different system. Like it's we have a real data sharing issue.",
