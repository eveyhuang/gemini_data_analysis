And uh actually, as far as I I know, they just do the prediction and to try for this year 2021, what will be the mainstream flu in the coming winter. And in one shot, actually, they will to insert three different kinds of vaccine in one shot. And uh this is kind of probability. You'll never know in the coming winter, which kind of uh virus will be the the dominate one. So this is a kind of a prediction problem, but I'm not sure is how what what is the data they use to do the prediction. And uh yes.
