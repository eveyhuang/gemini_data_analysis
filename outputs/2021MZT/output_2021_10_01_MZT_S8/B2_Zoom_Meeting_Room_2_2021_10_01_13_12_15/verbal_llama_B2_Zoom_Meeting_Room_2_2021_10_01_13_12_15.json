And you also don't want to have a attenuated virus that is not too attenuated that it will revert to wild type.

So the vaccine that might work from one strain might not work against the other. So what they have been doing is produce this multi uh like sort of like it's not a multivalent vaccine because it's a single protein but having epitopes uh from the different strains. Uh and take that and also couple it with something that could be targeted. So in cancer uh vaccine development they are trying to do target immunity. So they put receptors in whatever protein or molecule uh you are vaccinated uh your subjects with uh so that it uh increases the interaction with a specific innate immune cell because now we know how to trigger specific immune responses like if we target dendritic cells, we're going to have interferon gamma and that is going to lead to IGG antibodies of this class. So if we take all the information together and start that we have been seeing in vaccine development for cancer and we put it in infection disease development and we do something like that like right now if you think about the COVID vaccine, that is a liposome. So the the delivery of the messenger RNA is through liposome.

If we're talking about mRNA vaccines, um is it when when someone doesn't respond to the vaccine, is it insufficient expression of the antigen? Is it insufficient antigen presentation? Is it insufficient uh generation of of T follicular helper cells or is it is it uh the engagement of P cells? So we there are so many steps along the way and we don't know where it fails that I think um I I I agree with what Matt said earlier that that probably individualizing adjuvants would be the way to go because it's an easier um logistical process as opposed to individualizing the the vaccine itself. Um but but even for adjuvants we need to know where the bottleneck is. Um I think if we if we were able to and maybe that's that's something that can be done because of the the large scale of the current vaccine campaign, but if we were able to bin individuals into a finite number of response types, I think then we might be able to to classify them according to their individual bottlenecks. And and if it ends up being, I don't know if it would just be a gradient or if if we would end up with a finite number of clusters of of individuals according to their um specific host properties. But if that was the case, if it was a finite um number, then we might be able to um to have a more targeted approach and understand which response type would would uh um benefit from having a specific adjuvant. And I think that's something that at least in the mRNA space because it's so new is is definitely not explored sufficiently. Because I think as far as I know there there is um um at least the Moderna and uh and the Pfizer Biontech vaccines are are primarily using uh um the same type of of lipid nanoparticles without much variation to to enhance efficiency. And I think we also know that that much of the adjuvant activity comes from those lipid nanoparticles. But that might be a a space for immediate future development.

So, um to me it's it would be ideal to to combine something that would be most likely for bigger pathogens, you need a combination of of antigens, right? It's not one antigen will fit all. And how do we come up with that combination and the delivery system to me is the is the most crucial thing.
