            "transcript": "Yeah, and it's somewhat to somewhat related to the point that uh Gille made earlier about um is the future in in non specific vaccines? Can we can we generalize the approach to maybe not through trained immunity, but maybe through uh through an approach that would um boost resistance to a broader class of of uh pathogens as opposed to going, you know, strain by strain, which is essentially what the MRNA vaccines do. Um and should we as opposed to limiting the sequence space that we can cover, should we broaden resistance and and if so what what would be the way? Um I guess it's not it's not feasible to passively immunize the the global population, but are there is this something that can be conceptualized into maybe a yet unknown class of vaccines that that would um broadly boost innate immunity or or uh um mucosal resistance um sort of barrier integrity or or uh um the antiviral state of mucosal surfaces.",
