In this case for for COVID is just a spike, but we don't know whether other uh potential neutralizing antibodies from different pieces of the of the viral uh genome that code a protein may also have an impact in neutralizing or controlling the um the the infect the infectivity of the virus. Um, I think that the problem with live attenuated vaccines is again the balance because you don't want to have a too attenuated virus that doesn't replicate enough in the host and therefore doesn't elicit or stimulate the production of a particular threshold of antibodies or a immune response that is required to neutralize or control the infection. And you also don't want to have a attenuated virus that is not too attenuated that it will revert to wild type. So those are are I think critical issues with with the concept of that, but I like the idea of having a product like that so that um there are more diversity in the production of specific uh antiviral um antibodies.",

So what happens with lime disease is that the lime uh lime disease have outer membrane proteins that changes from strain to strain. So the vaccine that might work from one strain might not work against the other. So what they have been doing is produce this multi uh like sort of like it's not a multivalent vaccine because it's a single protein but having epitopes uh from the different strains. Uh and take that and also couple it with something that could be targeted. So in cancer uh vaccine development they are trying to do target immunity. So they put receptors in whatever protein or molecule uh you are vaccinated uh your subjects with uh so that it uh increases the interaction with a specific innate immune cell because now we know how to trigger specific immune responses like if we target dendritic cells, we're going to have interferon gamma and that is going to lead to IGG antibodies of this class. So if we take all the information together and start that we have been seeing in vaccine development for cancer and we put it in infection disease development and we do something like that like right now if you think about the COVID vaccine, that is a liposome. So the the delivery of the messenger RNA is through liposome. Can we take liposomes and put different epitopes from different proteins from different organisms to then make a multivalent vaccine that is a single molecule that targets a specific immune cell and then we can trigger a specific immune response that is long lasting.",

If we're talking about mRNA vaccines, um is it when when someone doesn't respond to the vaccine, is it insufficient expression of the antigen? Is it insufficient antigen presentation? Is it insufficient uh generation of of T follicular helper cells or is it is it uh the engagement of P cells? So we there are so many steps along the way and we don't know where it fails that I think um I I I agree with what Matt said earlier that that probably individualizing adjuvants would be the way to go because it's an easier um logistical process as opposed to individualizing the the vaccine itself. Um but but even for adjuvants we need to know where the bottleneck is. Um I think if we if we were able to and maybe that's that's something that can be done because of the the large scale of the current vaccine campaign, but if we were able to bin individuals into a finite number of response types, I think then we might be able to to classify them according to their individual bottlenecks. And and if it ends up being, I don't know if it would just be a gradient or if if we would end up with a finite number of clusters of of individuals according to their um specific host properties. But if that was the case, if it was a finite um number, then we might be able to um to have a more targeted approach and understand which response type would would uh um benefit from having a specific adjuvant. And I think that's something that at least in the mRNA space because it's so new is is definitely not explored sufficiently. Because I think as far as I know there there is um um at least the Moderna and uh and the Pfizer Biontech vaccines are are primarily using uh um the same type of of lipid nanoparticles without much variation to to enhance efficiency. And I think we also know that that much of the adjuvant activity comes from those lipid nanoparticles. But that might be a a space for immediate future development.

So, um to me it's it would be ideal to to combine something that would be most likely for bigger pathogens, you need a combination of of antigens, right? It's not one antigen will fit all. And how do we come up with that combination and the delivery system to me is the is the most crucial thing. And um I don't know why we moved now completely out of live attenuated things because they have worked in the past and there's there's commercially available. I don't know why we completely switch that and say okay, that's all technology, forget about it. And I don't know how you guys feel about it like the most some of the most successful vaccines have been live organisms. And now we have the way to provide extra safety precautions. So I don't know, are we are we just worrying about viruses in the future as threats? this is what everything is focusing now. I and I'm not I'm not being uh kind of like well I am a little bit biased but but is that really the only thing that we need to worry now in the future? because that's how it looks now like everything is I'm sorry, I'm being very honest and very and I I",
