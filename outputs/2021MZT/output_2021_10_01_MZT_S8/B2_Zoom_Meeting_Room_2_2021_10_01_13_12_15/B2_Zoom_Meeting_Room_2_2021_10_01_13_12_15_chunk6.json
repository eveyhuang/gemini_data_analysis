One is like the chronic endemic diseases from that affect like 99% of the population that kills many people where cold chain is the main factor that we mean we we are struggling with that we understand that but and completely different things like we know for 100 year history that a single antigen or protein is not going to create the next vaccine for a for all of these other pathogens. We know that for sure because otherwise we wouldn't have bacterial infections right now. So yeah. Sorry, I went over completely different but",

I don't yeah, and and again, uh I understanding it has to be cheap, it has to be quickly deployed and it has to, of course, nobody's going to find the perfect vaccine that it's going to cover the the entire population and I don't think that's the point either, right? When developing vaccines, we're not trying to prevent 100%. We're just it's it's basically like a a public health or like a concern, right? I don't think but I don't know.",
