So there is there has been some uh studies that they have examined by transcriptomics and also uh some metabolomics that there are specific uh transcription factors that are involved in uh innate immunity that uh in patients that have that suffer from diabetes, uh they seem to have a over glycosilation of certain transcription factors and this uh leads to heavy inflammation. And so for for those patients that get infected with uh respiratory diseases, the uh inflammatory process goes uncontrolled and it's because of this uh glycosilation in specific uh transcription factors. So that could be another way kind of to I don't know, to individualize uh therapy based on those markers.",

            "timestamp": "02:45-05:02",
            "transcript": "Yeah, going back to what Kurt just said, I I think the um the issue with individualized markers is that we don't really know what the what the bottleneck is. If we're talking about mRNA vaccines, um is it when when someone doesn't respond to the vaccine, is it insufficient expression of the antigen? Is it insufficient antigen presentation? Is it insufficient uh generation of of T follicular helper cells or is it is it uh the engagement of P cells? So we there are so many steps along the way and we don't know where it fails that I think um I I I agree with what Matt said earlier that that probably individualizing adjuvants would be the way to go because it's an easier um logistical process as opposed to individualizing the the vaccine itself. Um but but even for adjuvants we need to know where the bottleneck is. Um I think if we if we were able to and maybe that's that's something that can be done because of the the large scale of the current vaccine campaign, but if we were able to bin individuals into a finite number of response types, I think then we might be able to to classify them according to their individual bottlenecks. And and if it ends up being, I don't know if it would just be a gradient or if if we would end up with a finite number of clusters of of individuals according to their um specific host properties. But if that was the case, if it was a finite um number, then we might be able to um to have a more targeted approach and understand which response type would would uh um benefit from having a specific adjuvant. And I think that's something that at least in the mRNA space because it's so new is is definitely not explored sufficiently. Because I think as far as I know there there is um um at least the Moderna and uh and the Pfizer Biontech vaccines are are primarily using uh um the same type of of lipid nanoparticles without much variation to to enhance efficiency. And I think we also know that that much of the adjuvant activity comes from those lipid nanoparticles. But that might be a a space for immediate future development. Thinking even even inside the the realm of of RNA vaccines.",

And I don't think with the current uh capabilities that we're seeing so successful in in the for viruses can be just directly applying to bacteria because basically it doesn't it doesn't work like that. So, um to me it's it would be ideal to to combine something that would be most likely for bigger pathogens, you need a combination of of antigens, right? It's not one antigen will fit all. And how do we come up with that combination and the delivery system to me is the is the most crucial thing. And um I don't know why we moved now completely out of live attenuated things because they have worked in the past and there's there's commercially available. I don't know why we completely switch that and say okay, that's all technology, forget about it. And I don't know how you guys feel about it like the most some of the most successful vaccines have been live organisms. And now we have the way to provide extra safety precautions. So I don't know, are we are we just worrying about viruses in the future as threats? this is what everything is focusing now. I and I'm not I'm not being uh kind of like well I am a little bit biased but but is that really the only thing that we need to worry now in the future? because that's how it looks now like everything is I'm sorry, I'm being very honest and very and I I",
