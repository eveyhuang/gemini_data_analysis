I think because um, I think we know that that has to be very tightly regulated and excessive regulation of Taiwan interference can also lead to inflammation and that could be detrimental. So it's just keeping it all in the right balance. But I think the concept of live attenuated vaccines, um, I mean just going back to the to to the use of MRNA vaccines, you're just putting a single coding sequence, right? In this case for for COVID is just a spike, but we don't know whether other uh potential neutralizing antibodies from different pieces of the of the viral uh genome that code a protein may also have an impact in neutralizing or controlling the um the the infect the infectivity of the virus. Um, I think that the problem with live attenuated vaccines is again the balance because you don't want to have a too attenuated virus that doesn't replicate enough in the host and therefore doesn't elicit or stimulate the production of a particular threshold of antibodies or a immune response that is required to neutralize or control the infection. And you also don't want to have a attenuated virus that is not too attenuated that it will revert to wild type. So those are are I think critical issues with with the concept of that, but I like the idea of having a product like that so that um there are more diversity in the production of specific uh antiviral um antibodies.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, so I one thing that I I have been thinking is uh chimeric vaccine. So it's something like the people are studying right now with lime disease. So what happens with lime disease is that the lime uh lime disease have outer membrane proteins that changes from strain to strain. So the vaccine that might work from one strain might not work against the other. So what they have been doing is produce this multi uh like sort of like it's not a multivalent vaccine because it's a single protein but having epitopes uh from the different strains. Uh and take that and also couple it with something that could be targeted. So in cancer uh vaccine development they are trying to do target immunity. So they put receptors in whatever protein or molecule uh you are vaccinated uh your subjects with uh so that it uh increases the interaction with a specific innate immune cell because now we know how to trigger specific immune responses like if we target dendritic cells, we're going to have interferon gamma and that is going to lead to IGG antibodies of this class. So if we take all the information together and start that we have been seeing in vaccine development for cancer and we put it in infection disease development and we do something like that like right now if you think about the COVID vaccine, that is a liposome. So the the delivery of the messenger RNA is through liposome. Can we take liposomes and put different epitopes from different proteins from different organisms to then make a multivalent vaccine that is a single molecule that targets a specific immune cell and then we can trigger a specific immune response that is long lasting.",

Um because what I mean what we're seeing right now in the in the global population is that there is an incredible range of vaccine responses and that um among the people at least here in Philadelphia that that uh end up being hospitalized for for severe COVID-19 despite the fact that they were vaccinated are primarily the individuals that didn't develop antibodies.",
