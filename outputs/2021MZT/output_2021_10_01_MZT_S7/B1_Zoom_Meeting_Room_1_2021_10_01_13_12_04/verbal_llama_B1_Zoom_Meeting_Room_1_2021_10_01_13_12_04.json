Um kind of combining those two streams will be important. And then like Sarah, you were saying, if you have data on and people do this, if you have data on um like the reservoir potential of mule deer and a couple other servants, then can you make a prediction about what reservoir potential is going to be like in white tail deer.

So that way it's well positioned to to pick up mutations and and adapt to bind with high affinity to different H2s and different bat species and the likelihood of breaking the viral spike with any single mutation is low.
