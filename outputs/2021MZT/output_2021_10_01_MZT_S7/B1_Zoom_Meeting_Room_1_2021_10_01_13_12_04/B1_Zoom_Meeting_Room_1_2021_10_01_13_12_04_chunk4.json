Um how would somebody who is looking I guess at team development be able to tap you know like how could how what's so friendly to them that will allow them to be able to extract those data out of there. You know because you know like I can tell them to just read my papers and get right right? Um and the other modelers can read modeling data will be able to access you know access a certainly accessing um end product and I I don't think I could access an end product right now that is is only something that he licenses and is there a way that we can get that you know get get get some of that good stuff that that's going to come out of that that sort of thing across right.",

So it would be nice to have the ability for work on modelers or with people that are tracking tracking populations and start making some of these predictions that may allow us to get ahead of the disease right right before that transmission takes place but in my head I jump from I have some animals and I want to know where the next transmission events is happening but I don't know how to do that in the in the in the in domain. I have an idea of what my end product is going to be but I'm definitely talking to people that can actually make it happen or can develop the system or things like well we're also tracking these other you know surrogate parameters or perhaps animal movement or other diseases and things like that that we can then use to inform you know the question that I'm trying to ask.",

So when you're thinking about white tail deer and and ranchers, you know, um hunters and you know, I don't know, they didn't in some other states but in Montana, you know, they'll cut off the head and then they're looking for prion diseases. So I wonder if you could do serology analysis during hunting season, but at the same time maybe involve um to understand what um potential reservoirs could be surrounding agricultural animals, you could involve farmers and ask them to start tagging animals that are around their locations. Um and I guess coming from farm, I know that that's something that the farmers in our community would be really interested in doing. And I feel like those two data streams could be really interesting together and then eventually start doing more pathogen types of analyses after you know.",

It's like yes we're 20 degrees warmer and you know this is when they come into heat here versus there and therefore this is the best yes. Um you know so.",

I mean one way to do that is through uh people who are, you know, who work at those interfaces. And you see them in some fields, you know, like meteorology is a huge, you know, a lot of it's founded on like a massive modeling and forecasting enterprise. And a lot of people are, you know, very interested in that information for a whole variety of reasons. So, you know, you have like the the modelers who develop and test and validate these incredibly complicated models. Uh but they're typically not the ones who are going out and interacting directly with stakeholders. You know, you have a lot of other professionals whose, you know, because they're such a well established range of applications, you have a lot of people who are, you know, trained and do a lot of work at that interface.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I think that's yeah, awesome point. I really like what people have said. Yeah, it seems like in order to identify reservoirs and the risk of reservoir potential and the risk, yeah, I totally agree. So we need we need to recruit information from multiple different dimensions. I mean you can have you can have your lab studies that are testing, you know, competence at whatever molecular level you're testing competence at. That can tell you something important about one dimension of reservoir potential, but you also have your surveillance studies in the field that are telling you something about well what is what is serology looking like or true prevalence looking like at different locations. Um kind of combining those two streams will be important. And then like Sarah, you were saying, if you have data on and people do this, if you have data on um like the reservoir potential of mule deer and a couple other servants, then can you make a prediction about what reservoir potential is going to be like in white tail deer. So kind of combining these different sources of information seems like a really rich way to go. Um rather than kind of just being like, oh, I did a lab study called it reservoir species or oh, I saw this prevalence in the field call call it called it a reservoir species, but kind of this integration, I think that's a really cool point.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, and there are initiatives about so for example like the human the the animal movement. Um and I it's funny that you bring up the the example with deer because in Europe they have a really big network of people working on deer movement uh that they all connected and there's like a central uh system where they collect all that data in in an effort to try to understand many well, it's mostly from like the the animal behavior point, but it just I I know people that are using it for study tickborne diseases. So it's a very rich data set. Um and there are ways so I'm participating right now in a big mammal survey across the US with camera traps. So there is a lot of information that it's being leverage, I think also we're moving into a new area era that it's it's slowly taking off. Um there's a lot of I I being on the field so I I understand um the perspective of being in the field collecting all this data and then just putting out there and there's just a modeler that takes all the data and publishes a lot of papers and then I'm like I took three years to collect this data. So there's a lot of that and understanding how we navigate those relationships that are not straightforward. So that's still how we're I and I really appreciate.",
