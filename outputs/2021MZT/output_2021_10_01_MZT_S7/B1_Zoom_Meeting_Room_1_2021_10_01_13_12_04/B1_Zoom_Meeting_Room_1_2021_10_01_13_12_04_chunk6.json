I don't know if they use these kind of antiviral responses that you're all talking about to make predictions, but they do use kind of general, more general like life history traits of animals and many dimensions of different traits of particular animals that, you know, within sample you can say yeah, it's a reservoir and then kind of predict out of sample to other species. So it seems like the infrastructure for that and the uh, the sort of model development is there. I think that's like it would be really cool to have sort of a different data stream that's actually feeding into this structure that already exists and maybe make improved predictions out of sample to new new reservoirs.",

I I just add my understanding of immune systems of well even of vertebrates that are not mammals, um, is right now non-existent. So, um, and I even have like I understand that even the murine system and and the human system is different and there have been a lot of maybe predictions made that should not have been because of the differences between these um, immune systems, but I I think like the structure of like what a B cell does and what a different T cells are, that stuff is at least conserved. Um, it'd be kind of useful to know how conserved immunology is, you know, for for thinking about um, reservoir host responses, immune immune responses or um, protective mechanisms. Uh, maybe they would have to be categorized rather than specific immune responses by protective mechanisms. You know, basically, you know, is it is it something where you've got a cell that will engulf another cell versus a protective mechanism where it excretes something that will kill it versus, you know, um, uh, it it you know, basically it puts out um, reactive oxygen species or something.",

Are we thinking that they will maintain low viral loads, um, they're going to be highly super infectious. So what is the how are they going to contribute to onward transmission and the the transmission change in general. So defining that it's I think it's not trivial and we're just talking about like infection, um, being infected as the same as being able to contribute to onward infection when those are two complete different, well, I mean, depends, but not necessarily are related.",

So okay, there is a response, but then overall what happens afterwards, does that animal clear it or not?
