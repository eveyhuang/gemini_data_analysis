So it's it's managing that it's a little bit more tricky and it's just not think about just yeah, let's just collect all the data and just model it. Um, but I think there's certainly many initiatives in that sense that it's about integrating different data sets, data uh different data streams and also working with the communities as you someone mentioned with the the people in the farms and and trying to do that. But also understanding that if we're asking people to submit and do work in for the good of science that they understand what they're getting back from that.",

Um, so for example, we're now working on a model that was developed for CWD and trying to adopt it to elks and like thinking about elk cough disease in Washington, but also like CWD is expanding. So what it means if we actually get transmission of CWD in elk or in in how is the interaction between deer and elk and do they coexist in the same environments? Are they using the same environment? So we there's our problems that we're already thinking about too.",

So think about very different kinds of problems, but I just thought I might mention one um way in which biochemist in my community are very much interested in in future reservoirs for say SARS COV2. Um, where we've noticed that some of the new variants coming out, um, they no longer interact with bat receptors. Um, they you know, so you might view them as becoming more human specific variants of the virus or they interact now with receptors in other animals and then that may mean that the reservoirs in the future from which um virus might come back, you know, go into a new reservoir, come back and reinfect people, you need to consider because then they may um be sources of new genetic diversity. So for example, people are testing monoclonal antibodies against variants of SARS COV2 that moved into mink and became mink adapted. And we'd like to know will those monoclonal antibodies for use in humans, do they will they still work against the mink SARS COV2, which might come back and reinfect us and and have different diversity. So anyway, I just thought I'd throw that out there because I I think about different things than than a lot of the conversation. Um, those are the kinds of things that we think about.",

Yes. you start to see, you know, you may be able to infer from those mutations and then then you look out and you see how the virus is is adapting in in different hosts. You may be able to make some inferences without directly testing every time. Um SARS COV2 is an interesting case because um the binding site for the receptor in in the virus even though it's functionally conserved for binding to a certain key receptor, um it's sequence diverse because in bats, the receptor H2 is very polymorphic. And so it's thought that these coronaviruses have adapted so that the the viral spike at some level can tolerate lots of mutations without breaking its activity. So that way it's well positioned to to pick up mutations and and adapt to bind with high affinity to different H2s and different bat species and the likelihood of breaking the viral spike with any single mutation is low. So that means it can tolerate a lot of sequence diversity and that has huge implications for the you know potential resistance and you know many antibody drugs for example, they're all targeting the receptor binding site and yet that site can easily change.",

So I'll apologize for loud sounds in the background. Um, so so one thing we haven't perhaps incorporated into this multidisciplinary approach, right? To determining what makes a good reservoir host, um, potential for spread, um, migration, proximity to domestic species, etcetera, is actually looking at the pathogen itself, right? So so do we have a database out there that's looking at that evolutionary, you know, biology of that pathogen and how the pathogen is is changing through that particular reservoir host. So obviously for something like bacterium, I I don't necessarily worry about uh having escape mutants or anything like that. The evolution of that particular path particular pathogen is is really not of concern necessarily within, you know, a generation. But certainly for viruses is is that something else that we perhaps need to include into this model, right? That may just by looking at the pathogen and how the pathogen is is changing may make predictions about movement and what the next reservoir host may be or or how that would change how good or how bad a reservoir is for that particular pathogen.",
