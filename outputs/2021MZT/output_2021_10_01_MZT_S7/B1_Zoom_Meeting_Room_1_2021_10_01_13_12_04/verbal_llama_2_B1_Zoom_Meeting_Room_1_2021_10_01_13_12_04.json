Um kind of combining those two streams will be important. And then like Sarah, you were saying, if you have data on and people do this, if you have data on um like the reservoir potential of mule deer and a couple other servants, then can you make a prediction about what reservoir potential is going to be like in white tail deer.

You may be able to make some inferences without directly testing every time. Um SARS COV2 is an interesting case because um the binding site for the receptor in in the virus even though it's functionally conserved for binding to a certain key receptor, um it's sequence diverse because in bats, the receptor H2 is very polymorphic. And so it's thought that these coronaviruses have adapted so that the the viral spike at some level can tolerate lots of mutations without breaking its activity. So that way it's well positioned to to pick up mutations and and adapt to bind with high affinity to different H2s and different bat species and the likelihood of breaking the viral spike with any single mutation is low.
