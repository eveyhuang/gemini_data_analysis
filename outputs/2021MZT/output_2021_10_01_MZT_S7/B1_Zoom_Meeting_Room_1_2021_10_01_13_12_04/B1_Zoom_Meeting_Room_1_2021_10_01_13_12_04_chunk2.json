So exactly what kind of host immune response data are we interested in? Are we interested in simply are they infected or not infected? Are they um are they protected and not protected?

And of course it makes sense to think about um think about uh all of these sources of very or many of the sources of variation on a species to species basis. I'm I'm curious what your opinions are. Are there prospects of looking at higher levels, you know, groups of species, something along the lines of functional groups? You know, the reason being that if we try to frame this in uh a practical standpoint from surveillance, one of the challenges is that there are just a huge number of species out there, really more than we can deal with. So, you know, is I'm just curious your thoughts, is, you know, kind of like aggregating types or groups or guilds of species potentially um an effective way to try to simplify the problem or is there, you know, just too much species to species variability to be thinking about doing that.",
