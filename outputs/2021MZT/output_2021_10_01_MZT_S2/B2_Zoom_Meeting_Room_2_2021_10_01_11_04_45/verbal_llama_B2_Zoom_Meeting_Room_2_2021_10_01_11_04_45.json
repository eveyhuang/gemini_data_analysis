So I think there's these huge data gaps and um a classic one I often think about too is like the bluetongue virus is the predictability of it moving with climate change has been it's been assumed that vectors in an area if they're not phylogenetically related to the current vector that they're not going to be able to transmit that. But that was actually shown in Europe in the late 2000s that the virus completely jumped to another species of biting midge that was not even closely related phylogenetically and it was assumed throughout Europe that none of these vectors were actually um none of these species were actually able to transmit the virus and that testing was all based on just phylogenetic predictions. Um so I think evolutionary history being a component of this can be informative um and in context with ecology too and so I go often go back to what Kim's talking about different data types and how can these data types be joined in some type of predictive model and weighted based on the different systems to lead to a predictive outcome.

Like we're never wall to wall or if we're wall to wall in one system where it's not replicated, you know, I mean now maybe we're good for SARS COV2 but maybe not anywhere else. Um, I I was asking Becker about this in the chat but I I wonder it seems like it'd be really useful to be able to infuse like model like dynamic systems, you know, we know that force is going to be driven by the size of the susceptible pool and how susceptible they are. So disease history is going to matter. It's going to um be driven by the size of the infectious pool. It's going to be driven by probability of transmission given contact and by contact and contact's got to be both the intra specific contact and then with humans too. Um, and we kind of know that dynamic and we've got bits of it well estimated in a bunch of different systems. It would be really nice to be able to like prime machine learning algorithms with some of the dynamic information we already have, like put priors on these ML algorithms to kind of get them winnowed into some space and then maybe we could and we what we I think that we've got to be able to combine sparse data across a bunch of different systems. And and by sparse I mean like some systems we've got great movement information and nothing on post establishment factors, you know, and in other systems we've got great movement on evolutionary dynamics of the pathogen and nothing on host contact. You know, like we've got to be able to combine data in that kind of patchy way and like I I don't know how to do that, but it does seem like maybe we could get somewhere if we could leverage dynamics with machine learning in tandem. Um, and I have no idea if that's something people are chasing around, but um, I think I I I think that gathering data is not the answer. Like we should do that, but also we're never going to do that well enough.

It's at a lake where they started I I don't know if the farms preexisted but they started farming a lot of animals in and around these lakes where migratory birds were coming in and landing. And so you had birds living, you know, domesticated birds which people are living in very close proximity with their birds that are being exposed to wild birds and that um, you know, H5N1 won the lottery, it had the right features to then uh infect humans and highly pathogenic avian influenza only evolves in chickens. It does not evolve in wild birds. So that was where actually the the chicken, the human behavior of raising all of these chickens actually um led to evolution of that virus that then have farther downstream um effects. Um, so I I I think human behavior is probably the only way we're going to get a handle on some of this because we cannot just we we don't have the resources to monitor every wild animal out there.

And and I just, you know, one thing that popped in my mind is the example of earthquakes, predicting earthquakes. Um, you know, they're similarly they're highly probabilistic, almost impossible to predict. And you know, in some ways we could say that the disease emergence is sort of a biological earthquake. But, you know, so what what they've done in that field is they've gotten a long way by breaking it down into different levels. We can't predict every individual earthquake, but knowledge, you know, data and knowledge of plate tectonics does a great job of predicting areas that are earthquake prone. Um, in areas that are earthquake prone, you can deploy, you know, sophisticated and very expensive uh monitors to give early warning. But, you know, you wouldn't be able to do that all over, you know, all over the planet. And, you know, of course, it's not a direct comparison, but thinking about breaking the problem down by scale like that, uh, and potentially having, you know, some different pieces that work together, not to predict everything, but to, you know, get us potentially a lot further than we are right now, might be a fruitful way to, you know, start thinking about and organizing some of these ideas.

It's like how do we refine predictions like a mechanistic based prediction at the intermediate scale that would let us move across species, which I think we're maybe not doing all that well, but still stay grounded in the environment, still be able to make a prediction on the basis of environmental covariance, which I think is eventually maybe what we're going to want to be able to do. Um, but I I'm still struggling to understand how like microbiome there is harder for me like like I I can't tie microbiome as tightly to the environment as I feel I can tie metabolism.
