Um, is that would that be accurate?",

That's just what I was thinking. I don't know about everybody else.",

We have data on where the human are and even we can start also integrating well what will be the impact of climate change or landscape change by humans on both like humans behavior and and host like I don't know yeah, can we get at that level like instead of focusing maybe on one species that might tell us everything is there a general landscape features that are and then are we able to kind of make spatial predictions and all of that. I feel we have the guiding sometimes there's a lot of finding like like landscape change lead a lot a lot of these uh outbreak we had in the past for example. So can we use that data to make those spatial predictions?",

I know this is kind of the overall goal of what what has been mentioned before with like remote sensing and these big ideas but I just we don't have the I guess enough fine scale data to get there but I often think about it as systemic traits for predictability.",

We've got a kind of global predictions of where spillover should occur through um, kind of through data mining approaches, but we're sort of missing the intermediate scale and I think um, it seems to me like maybe yeah, like I guess what I'm sort of looking for and metabolism maybe seems promising and maybe there's a microbiome component here that's promising as well. It's like how do we refine predictions like a mechanistic based prediction at the intermediate scale that would let us move across species, which I think we're maybe not doing all that well, but still stay grounded in the environment, still be able to make a prediction on the basis of environmental covariance, which I think is eventually maybe what we're going to want to be able to do. Um, but I I'm still struggling to understand how like microbiome there is harder for me like like I I can't tie microbiome as tightly to the environment as I feel I can tie metabolism. Um, so I I totally hear the point that it's going to be pretty salient.",

I think kind of the at the intermediate scale is thinking sort of about, you know, where where and when are are animals most likely to be infectious or shedding. Um, and that's really hard to, you know, get like virus isolation or what not. So, you know, having whether it's a metabolic signature or immunological signature of of shedding and kind of how that, you know, actually varies over over space and time and can start linking that into, you know, what are the the temporal covariance or you know, are the environmental covariance are they really localized like micro climate? Are they more broad scale like habitat fragmentation? Um, and can we try to at least identify course times of the year seasonally is it you know do with migration or or reproductive pulses. Um, that might give us a general sense of, you know, maybe starting in one or two well studied host systems, you know, what are those times and places of high spill over risk and then can we start extrapolate that across across different host systems is is maybe one kind of good way to go.",
