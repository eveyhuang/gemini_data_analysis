So I don't know, it's not really a question but just kind of I guess a challenge to think about in this sort of thing. Yeah, no, no, it's it's you're right, it's a challenge to think about.

Uh, is it just the uh, density of the pathogen in reservoir populations? Because right now that's what we're looking at. We are looking at uh, the incidence of a pathogen in a reservoir and that's when we're uh, then we go to the risk assessment. many of the cases, uh, many of the pathogens we don't even know that they are human pathogens until they make the jump. Like one of the pathogens that I work with it was a bovine uh, pathogen in Europe for 200 years. And suddenly in 1995, it made the jump to humans. So why is making what is it that is allowing these pathogens to start infecting humans? We don't understand that and because we don't understand that, it's really hard to predict when this is going to happen. Uh, right now we're being more rather than predicting is is we are being reactive rather than proactive.",

Is there any way we can kind of come up with like maybe kind of general principles that might help us like instead of it seems a lot of the work we're doing is very sometimes pathogen specific. But yeah, like can basically do we have at some point enough data that we can start building more general like yeah, first almost principles of like well this these types of pathogens will be maybe transmitting like we should expect this and then that might help because it seems right now a lot of and we had the same I feel the same discussion yesterday in the movement section. It also I think it links to Kim's. The point is that the notion of scale and I think sometimes the scale of the data and the scale of like of what we're trying to accomplish as well. Sometimes like if you're trying to predict at a global scale before it happens, you probably don't need the same level of data. If you're trying to basically intervene or the minute it's detected, then you need a probably finer scale data about the system.",

Um, and we know a lot of viruses and we even detect a lot of human infections with zootic viruses. Probably like right now, I think every week there's been a new human infection with a zootic virus. And so this is happening and where we struggle as a field is we we don't know how big a threat these are. Basically our our ability to detect threat is oh, there's an increase in human infections. Um, and so I mean the predictions, I think at least for flu is very challenging in terms of what is going to be what's going to make that jump. Um, and that that's where I think the flu field, which is well funded to do a lot of surveillance struggles to to make sense of.",

So um, been working with a group who were basically doing a bunch of different machine learning algorithms to try to predict um uh bat hosts of beta coronaviruses. So including but not limited to to SARS like viruses. Um, we just try to compare different kinds of of model structures and one of the things that we found when kind of validating everything was definitely that if you take um you know, models that incorporate any kind of trait information on in this case that ecology, but you know, any kind of host ecology, those seem to to definitely outperform other approaches using, you know, kind of network structure of the the host pathogen network or something like that. So it's not I guess that's not really as much about um, you know, contact or fine scale ecology per se, but you know, even just thinking about this really big macro scale prediction, you know, we we do kind of expect the the ecology of the reservoir host to play a really important role and even describing very broad scale um predictive patterns. I'm sure as we we dig down more into actual, you know, contact and all of that with humans that that only kind of improves it more, but um yeah, I guess just seconding Kim on on just the importance of kind of even just basic ecological information about about different species almost sort of like natural history work is really foundational.

I mean in the literature do we have any, you know, do we have a body of knowledge that indicates whether um, you know, there's greater potential for major outbreaks from uh, you know, pathogens emerging from within the the ecosystem as opposed to newly imported ones. I mean West Nile virus is kind of a classic example of a pathogen hitting a new continent and going wild. Um, but then, you know, you can cite counter examples as well, you know, maybe Lyme disease in the US in terms of something that was probably around for a long time and then, you know, went wild as a result of, you know, gradual land use and ecosystem change. So yeah, you know, listening to you talk, I'm just curious if anyone has a sense of whether we know anything about that one way or the other from the literature.",
