We are looking at uh, the incidence of a pathogen in a reservoir and that's when we're uh, then we go to the risk assessment. many of the cases, uh, many of the pathogens we don't even know that they are human pathogens until they make the jump. Like one of the pathogens that I work with it was a bovine uh, pathogen in Europe for 200 years. And suddenly in 1995, it made the jump to humans. So why is making what is it that is allowing these pathogens to start infecting humans? We don't understand that and because we don't understand that, it's really hard to predict when this is going to happen. Uh, right now we're being more rather than predicting is is we are being reactive rather than proactive.",

But yeah, like can basically do we have at some point enough data that we can start building more general like yeah, first almost principles of like well this these types of pathogens will be maybe transmitting like we should expect this and then that might help because it seems right now a lot of and we had the same I feel the same discussion yesterday in the movement section. It also I think it links to Kim's. The point is that the notion of scale and I think sometimes the scale of the data and the scale of like of what we're trying to accomplish as well. Sometimes like if you're trying to predict at a global scale before it happens, you probably don't need the same level of data. If you're trying to basically intervene or the minute it's detected, then you need a probably finer scale data about the system.",

So it's not I guess that's not really as much about um, you know, contact or fine scale ecology per se, but you know, even just thinking about this really big macro scale prediction, you know, we we do kind of expect the the ecology of the reservoir host to play a really important role and even describing very broad scale um predictive patterns. I'm sure as we we dig down more into actual, you know, contact and all of that with humans that that only kind of improves it more, but um yeah, I guess just seconding Kim on on just the importance of kind of even just basic ecological information about about different species almost sort of like natural history work is really foundational.

I mean West Nile virus is kind of a classic example of a pathogen hitting a new continent and going wild.

And then sometimes we often make the assumption that pathogens that are more closely related to each other are more likely to affect the same type of host. Well we also see that's not often the case. So I think there's these huge data gaps and um a classic one I often think about too is like the bluetongue virus is the predictability of it moving with climate change has been it's been assumed that vectors in an area if they're not phylogenetically related to the current vector that they're not going to be able to transmit that. But that was actually shown in Europe in the late 2000s that the virus completely jumped to another species of biting midge that was not even closely related phylogenetically and it was assumed throughout Europe that none of these vectors were actually um none of these species were actually able to transmit the virus and that testing was all based on just phylogenetic predictions. Um so I think evolutionary history being a component of this can be informative um and in context with ecology too and so I go often go back to what Kim's talking about different data types and how can these data types be joined in some type of predictive model and weighted based on the different systems to lead to a predictive outcome.",

Like we're never wall to wall or if we're wall to wall in one system where it's not replicated, you know, I mean now maybe we're good for SARS COV2 but maybe not anywhere else. Um, I I was asking Becker about this in the chat but I I wonder it seems like it'd be really useful to be able to infuse like model like dynamic systems, you know, we know that force is going to be driven by the size of the susceptible pool and how susceptible they are. So disease history is going to matter. It's going to um be driven by the size of the infectious pool. It's going to be driven by probability of transmission given contact and by contact and contact's got to be both the intra specific contact and then with humans too. Um, and we kind of know that dynamic and we've got bits of it well estimated in a bunch of different systems. It would be really nice to be able to like prime machine learning algorithms with some of the dynamic information we already have, like put priors on these ML algorithms to kind of get them winnowed into some space and then maybe we could and we what we I think that we've got to be able to combine sparse data across a bunch of different systems. And and by sparse I mean like some systems we've got great movement information and nothing on post establishment factors, you know, and in other systems we've got great movement on evolutionary dynamics of the pathogen and nothing on host contact. You know, like we've got to be able to combine data in that kind of patchy way and like I I don't know how to do that, but it does seem like maybe we could get somewhere if we could leverage dynamics with machine learning in tandem. Um, and I have no idea if that's something people are chasing around, but um, I think I I I think that gathering data is not the answer. Like we should do that, but also we're never going to do that well enough. I think it's got to be there's got to be some methodological I think we got to make progress on the methodological side first.",

I mean a lot of the the data that we're using are just, you know, infection status, you know, in the in the reservoir um and it's hard to differentiate whether we're looking at dead end hosts or actually competent reservoirs and so I think trying to incorporate more immunological data is a really nice thing to be thinking about, but it's hard to think about maybe how to do that at a scale where you can generate enough data across enough different species um to actually have it be a meaningful feature in the predictive predictive modeling um analysis.",

I think that's a huge factor because you don't get spillover if humans don't go out and handle these animals and change our behaviors and avian influence is an example of that where um the H5N1 virus you're talking about evolved in a certain area of China. It's at a lake where they started I I don't know if the farms preexisted but they started farming a lot of animals in and around these lakes where migratory birds were coming in and landing. And so you had birds living, you know, domesticated birds which people are living in very close proximity with their birds that are being exposed to wild birds and that um, you know, H5N1 won the lottery, it had the right features to then uh infect humans and highly pathogenic avian influenza only evolves in chickens. It does not evolve in wild birds. So that was where actually the the chicken, the human behavior of raising all of these chickens actually um led to evolution of that virus that then have farther downstream um effects. Um, so I I I think human behavior is probably the only way we're going to get a handle on some of this because we cannot just we we don't have the resources to monitor every wild animal out there. Um but we can we can follow humans especially with our wonderful use of cell phones and things like that.",

As I hear the the discussion, you know, I think a lot of what comes up is this idea that, you know, wow, this is complex, multiscale, you know, we tend to think about it at, you know, the level of individual level with respect to transmission, but that's not, you know, it's not practical at, you know, regional to global levels. And and I just, you know, one thing that popped in my mind is the example of earthquakes, predicting earthquakes. Um, you know, they're similarly they're highly probabilistic, almost impossible to predict. And you know, in some ways we could say that the disease emergence is sort of a biological earthquake. But, you know, so what what they've done in that field is they've gotten a long way by breaking it down into different levels. We can't predict every individual earthquake, but knowledge, you know, data and knowledge of plate tectonics does a great job of predicting areas that are earthquake prone. Um, in areas that are earthquake prone, you can deploy, you know, sophisticated and very expensive uh monitors to give early warning. But, you know, you wouldn't be able to do that all over, you know, all over the planet. And, you know, of course, it's not a direct comparison, but thinking about breaking the problem down by scale like that, uh, and potentially having, you know, some different pieces that work together, not to predict everything, but to, you know, get us potentially a lot further than we are right now, might be a fruitful way to, you know, start thinking about and organizing some of these ideas.",

We have data on where the human are and even we can start also integrating well what will be the impact of climate change or landscape change by humans on both like humans behavior and and host like I don't know yeah, can we get at that level like instead of focusing maybe on one species that might tell us everything is there a general landscape features that are and then are we able to kind of make spatial predictions and all of that. I feel we have the guiding sometimes there's a lot of finding like like landscape change lead a lot a lot of these uh outbreak we had in the past for example.

It's like how do we refine predictions like a mechanistic based prediction at the intermediate scale that would let us move across species, which I think we're maybe not doing all that well, but still stay grounded in the environment, still be able to make a prediction on the basis of environmental covariance, which I think is eventually maybe what we're going to want to be able to do. Um, but I I'm still struggling to understand how like microbiome there is harder for me like like I I can't tie microbiome as tightly to the environment as I feel I can tie metabolism.

So, you know, having whether it's a metabolic signature or immunological signature of of shedding and kind of how that, you know, actually varies over over space and time and can start linking that into, you know, what are the the temporal covariance or you know, are the environmental covariance are they really localized like micro climate? Are they more broad scale like habitat fragmentation? Um, and can we try to at least identify course times of the year seasonally is it you know do with migration or or reproductive pulses. Um, that might give us a general sense of, you know, maybe starting in one or two well studied host systems, you know, what are those times and places of high spill over risk and then can we start extrapolate that across across different host systems is is maybe one kind of good way to go.",
