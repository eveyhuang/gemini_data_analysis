Basically sort of across the hallway from Kim, so we do know each other quite well. Uh so my discipline tends to fall in area of like molecular ecology and disease ecology and that's the application of genetic and genomic tools towards wildlife population and disease management. Um I've worked with a variety of pathogens from avian influenza, uh currently working with rabies virus and I've also worked with some vector ecology as well as host and reservoir ecology. And my current focus as I mentioned is rabies virus and understanding reservoir species movement uh to help facilitate uh rabies management in the United States. We're also interested in spillover from the standpoint of how rabies um ecological side of how rabies variants jump hosts and move into from one host to another.",
