But now you're seeing more and more um strains that are identified that cross into humans. So you don't really do a human to human transmission well, but these appear to be mostly in China. So taking what Adela said and some of the others is it, is it because the human behavior, is it that different over there? Is it something genetically different about the strains or or the evolution of these? Um, but that's a real life thing, right? And H5N1 spread a lot in different countries and now you have these other strains that are also jumping versus like I said in the 80s we never saw that. And maybe it was just surveillance, maybe we didn't have enough surveillance and these were these random events without this transmission.",

            "transcript": "I I can add some context to that. So, um, you know, we were talking about including humans in the ecological models. I think that's a huge factor because you don't get spillover if humans don't go out and handle these animals and change our behaviors and avian influence is an example of that where um the H5N1 virus you're talking about evolved in a certain area of China. It's at a lake where they started I I don't know if the farms preexisted but they started farming a lot of animals in and around these lakes where migratory birds were coming in and landing. And so you had birds living, you know, domesticated birds which people are living in very close proximity with their birds that are being exposed to wild birds and that um, you know, H5N1 won the lottery, it had the right features to then uh infect humans and highly pathogenic avian influenza only evolves in chickens. It does not evolve in wild birds. So that was where actually the the chicken, the human behavior of raising all of these chickens actually um led to evolution of that virus that then have farther downstream um effects. Um, so I I I think human behavior is probably the only way we're going to get a handle on some of this because we cannot just we we don't have the resources to monitor every wild animal out there. Um but we can we can follow humans especially with our wonderful use of cell phones and things like that.",

            "transcript": "Uh I I I was going to just chime in. As I hear the the discussion, you know, I think a lot of what comes up is this idea that, you know, wow, this is complex, multiscale, you know, we tend to think about it at, you know, the level of individual level with respect to transmission, but that's not, you know, it's not practical at, you know, regional to global levels. And and I just, you know, one thing that popped in my mind is the example of earthquakes, predicting earthquakes. Um, you know, they're similarly they're highly probabilistic, almost impossible to predict. And you know, in some ways we could say that the disease emergence is sort of a biological earthquake. But, you know, so what what they've done in that field is they've gotten a long way by breaking it down into different levels. We can't predict every individual earthquake, but knowledge, you know, data and knowledge of plate tectonics does a great job of predicting areas that are earthquake prone. Um, in areas that are earthquake prone, you can deploy, you know, sophisticated and very expensive uh monitors to give early warning. But, you know, you wouldn't be able to do that all over, you know, all over the planet. And, you know, of course, it's not a direct comparison, but thinking about breaking the problem down by scale like that, uh, and potentially having, you know, some different pieces that work together, not to predict everything, but to, you know, get us potentially a lot further than we are right now, might be a fruitful way to, you know, start thinking about and organizing some of these ideas.",

I think um uh I mean there's been a fair amount of work that's tried to delineate those different stages and um and I think they're maybe fairly well articulated. I think that one of the I mean this is a little far a field for me so I should probably let Becker talk about this but but but it seems to me like, you know, one of the challenges is that different things, you know, different pathogens emerge in really different contexts and so a global prediction is a little bit more challenging. you're we're still kind of on a case by case basis where, you know, density of reservoir host A looks like this but density of reservoir host B looks this other way and how do we combine those, you know, that I think that's to me that seems like the challenge.",

You can look also like because we know even in humans the depending on the metabolism, you have different processes like a person that has obesity tends to have a stronger inflammatory response than a person that is lean and exercise.
