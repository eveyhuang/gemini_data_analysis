Because I think those two things are could, you know, lead to different focus in terms of like what you might what data you might want to collect and what questions you might want to pursue.

We're not going to be able to wall to wall sample in humans either at the resolution that we'd want. So I guess I don't know that it like I agree with you. I don't think they're mutually exclusive, but um, what I wonder in my mind is do we need to think about what we're trying to get out of data.",

We need to try to predict and um, have effective surveillance, but as we saw with SARS COV2, you know, even our surveillance of human diseases is not very good and takes a long time to catch things. So we really need effective surveillance and increased knowledge about predicting um, and I think to do both of those, you know, it's a big effort. Um, kind of seems insurmountable, but I think that's what what it we need to to work on.",
