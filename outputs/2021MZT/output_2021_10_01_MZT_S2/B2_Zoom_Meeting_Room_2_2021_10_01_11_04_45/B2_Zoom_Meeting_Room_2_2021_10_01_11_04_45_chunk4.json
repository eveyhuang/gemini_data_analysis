And then sometimes we often make the assumption that pathogens that are more closely related to each other are more likely to affect the same type of host. Well we also see that's not often the case. So I think there's these huge data gaps and um a classic one I often think about too is like the bluetongue virus is the predictability of it moving with climate change has been it's been assumed that vectors in an area if they're not phylogenetically related to the current vector that they're not going to be able to transmit that. But that was actually shown in Europe in the late 2000s that the virus completely jumped to another species of biting midge that was not even closely related phylogenetically and it was assumed throughout Europe that none of these vectors were actually um none of these species were actually able to transmit the virus and that testing was all based on just phylogenetic predictions. Um so I think evolutionary history being a component of this can be informative um and in context with ecology too and so I go often go back to what Kim's talking about different data types and how can these data types be joined in some type of predictive model and weighted based on the different systems to lead to a predictive outcome.",

Because many of like for example SARS. SARS happened because as human we went to the wild, got animals in the wild, brought them to a market and then it went over board. Uh, so how are we uh accounting for the human role, like yeah, the host behavior it matters, but we are a big driver of these spillovers. So are we counting this in the models when we make them?",

            "transcript": "Um, yeah, it's interesting listening to what you're you all are saying about this and um, and you know, Mike's question about do we know what the big drivers are and you know, it seems to me like in every system we're data rich somewhere and data poor somewhere else. Like we're never wall to wall or if we're wall to wall in one system where it's not replicated, you know, I mean now maybe we're good for SARS COV2 but maybe not anywhere else. Um, I I was asking Becker about this in the chat but I I wonder it seems like it'd be really useful to be able to infuse like model like dynamic systems, you know, we know that force is going to be driven by the size of the susceptible pool and how susceptible they are. So disease history is going to matter. It's going to um be driven by the size of the infectious pool. It's going to be driven by probability of transmission given contact and by contact and contact's got to be both the intra specific contact and then with humans too. Um, and we kind of know that dynamic and we've got bits of it well estimated in a bunch of different systems. It would be really nice to be able to like prime machine learning algorithms with some of the dynamic information we already have, like put priors on these ML algorithms to kind of get them winnowed into some space and then maybe we could and we what we I think that we've got to be able to combine sparse data across a bunch of different systems. And and by sparse I mean like some systems we've got great movement information and nothing on post establishment factors, you know, and in other systems we've got great movement on evolutionary dynamics of the pathogen and nothing on host contact. You know, like we've got to be able to combine data in that kind of patchy way and like I I don't know how to do that, but it does seem like maybe we could get somewhere if we could leverage dynamics with machine learning in tandem. Um, and I have no idea if that's something people are chasing around, but um, I think I I I think that gathering data is not the answer. Like we should do that, but also we're never going to do that well enough. I think it's got to be there's got to be some methodological I think we got to make progress on the methodological side first.",

So whether it's something about receptor use or immune system or adaptive immunity. Um, you know, a lot of times the the the features that we're using in these models are are kind of coarse things like um, you know, body mass or the the size of a species or something and those are you know, probably proxies for for something sort of immunological that's actually determining um, you know, transmission within within the reservoir host or the ability to actually generate new infections. I mean a lot of the the data that we're using are just, you know, infection status, you know, in the in the reservoir um and it's hard to differentiate whether we're looking at dead end hosts or actually competent reservoirs and so I think trying to incorporate more immunological data is a really nice thing to be thinking about, but it's hard to think about maybe how to do that at a scale where you can generate enough data across enough different species um to actually have it be a meaningful feature in the predictive predictive modeling um analysis.",
