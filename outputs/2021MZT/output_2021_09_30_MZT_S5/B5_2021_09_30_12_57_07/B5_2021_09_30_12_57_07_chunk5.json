Couldn't we start looking at homology protein structures on all of the proteins that are on cell surfaces and compare those across species? And you wouldn't even have to look at a pathogen. You could say, you know, what is similar and if you start seeing pathogens that are using similar receptors, you could make some guesses in terms of what human susceptibility is. Gets more complicated because there's also, you know, glycosylated sugars and things like that, but if you wanted to dream big and start trying to make predictions about what would be threatening to humans, that would be one way of going.",

Uh but you identify um that um hotspot that cluster and you act upon it before it it spreads to another cluster.
