            "transcript": "solution. The the solution right now is, oh, it's infected a person, we better characterize it. Um, and one of the breakout sessions I mentioned it, one of the problems we have is that we're also a little hand tied right now in terms of the the types of experiments we can do to uncover is a new virus a threat or what happened if this changed, would it cause a problem. Um, so there has to be a bit of a a change in our mentality towards how we view these viruses and um, and a change in how we allocate resources. I think there is good news. I think um, you know, the Sears influenza network has focused its resources on more of these animal human interfaces instead of just going out and sampling birds in Delaware Bay endlessly. Now we're focusing on you know, animal interfaces, um, but again still we're stuck trying to translate that knowledge.",

Um, but even still then, the response is they detect a high path virus and then they start they just start killing chickens. And they just depopulate millions and millions of chickens and that's that's the response. And so it's this hammer type approach that you probably don't need that we probably can move past.",

And I've heard interventions is like, well, we just is like, let's kill all the dogs as a serious proposal and I'm like, you can't. Uh, but they're the good the good thing is like you can think about targeted interventions. like, okay, we understand that dogs may be a problem for this sonatic diseases, especially for some of them are really infectious um to the vector to other hosts. So maybe we can think about how we limit the trans the onward transmission if we cannot limit the population or if limiting the population just get us to a point but we cannot uh we can't eliminate dogs. So we maybe we can do some population control, but that's not going to be just the only intervention we can do.",

So if you're if you have farmers, you know, a lot of these rural locations have their farms that abut upon natural habitats, sampling the farmers, looking in the farmers, I think is a good place to start. Um, and then also places like wet bird markets or live live animal markets where you have densities of animals and people.
