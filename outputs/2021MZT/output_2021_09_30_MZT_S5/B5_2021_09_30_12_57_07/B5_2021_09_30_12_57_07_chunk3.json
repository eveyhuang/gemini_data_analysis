It seems to all be interconnected and I would like to add going back initially what was talking about and some others is like this interface area where you have livestock, wildlife, humans coming into contact. I feel like one of the shortcomings here is is some type of early detection system, right? As as the pathogens are moving into these habitats whether it's through environmental change, we've now created an environment where domestic species like can now move into that area where they previously didn't or we've increased human populations in these areas but or we've increased livestock deforestation and then growing livestock in these areas. Um we don't know what's happening as we're cutting down these trees and changing these ecosystems, what types of pathogens, what types of threats are actually there and we're often reactive. Oh now we see the the infections are happening but it's already too late at that point because it's already kind of taken off or got the snowball effect. But the development and this is probably futuristic but some type of technological advancement that allows us to early detect in these interface systems threats. And I don't know what those are but I'm just throwing out Star Trek type ideas of where we could go with this in the future.",

And uh when we isolate viruses from them, we can see their uh growth kinetics or their uh their properties are different. Uh so so there is always difference between a group of viruses being isolated or uh sequenced versus you isolate different types of viruses and then you characterize them is uh different.
