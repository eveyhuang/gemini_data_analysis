I think when it especially when we are we're talking about um host sensors or or biological sensors that indicate an infection like the like the interferon uh test that we talked about because um I don't know much about interference in animals, but I don't know how um or I wonder how how conserved the sequence is and if we can rapidly detect interference in humans, can this be done in a pig, in a cow, in a in a um in a bat with with equal degree of efficiency and effectiveness or do we need for each uh substrain of that do we need a different interferon test which would of course limit uh the ability to deploy this at a large scale. That's why something like temperature is very easy because temperature can be done in in all kinds of animals or or a microbial sequence will be the same in all kinds of animals. But a host based sensor even though it's very attractive and and is probably very um amenable to um artificial intelligence monitoring um just comes with the limitation that it's that there might be very strong animal to animal variability in terms of how much the test can be used.",
