Like picking out the useful information from um, so I don't know if anybody that's not certainly not my area of expertise. I don't know if anybody has anything they want to add to sort of an important key point for thoughts on that.",

Uh, why is uh whether our current machine learning tools and intelligent artificial intelligence um can help to automate uh those detection process. Of course, it has to be guided. Um, uh, but if you can hand over a certain level of tasks to uh those um uh automation, right? Those uh intelligence methods, then then we can free some of the resources.
