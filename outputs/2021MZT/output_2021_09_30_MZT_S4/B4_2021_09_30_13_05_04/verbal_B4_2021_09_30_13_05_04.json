So if we have the possibility to have in in in in one test or in like rapid test, the possibility or one or two to detect in general different species that can be affecting a specific population in a specific area that we have uh I don't know I'm I'm talking by by by my my experience for example here in in in Louisiana that we have this climate change that we have all these new uh these uh animals uh moving from different areas. How this movement how we can surve make a surveillance trying to detect what those animals are coming or um bringing sorry, I don't know uh to an area that we we we haven't that before. I don't know if that makes sense what I'm saying. So if we have the possibility to have an work in in in an specific question uh what we have in these areas that we have uh animals that we have vectors transmitting uh not only viruses, uh we have uh transmitting parasites, transmitting uh bacteria. The question is how we can predict or how we can do a surveillance with this general question. No? Okay, we have this new, we have this parasite that we we haven't seen this before, this this genome or this strain here. How is this going to to be a risk for the other animals in the area and human. Or the bacteria or and what will be in these animals or the um as as uh mentioned or no Jenny where exactly we are going to detect. I think you you you ask about the different materials, no? Is is not the same when we are doing uh diagnostic in blood that we are doing diagnostic in in feces or you know? So what is is the also for us or in terms of surveillance to collect from animals. So so these these are things that we need to think to to to put this this this area, this area and this area, the question that we have for this specific uh animals in this area regarding the environmental changes that they are suffering what this is different south southern US uh US from northern US.

Um, uh, but if you can hand over a certain level of tasks to uh those um uh automation, right? Those uh intelligence methods, then then we can free some of the resources. When we deal with the pandemic, uh, the major problem is we do not have we do not have enough resources. Our resources is really limited. How you prioritize those resources. ",
