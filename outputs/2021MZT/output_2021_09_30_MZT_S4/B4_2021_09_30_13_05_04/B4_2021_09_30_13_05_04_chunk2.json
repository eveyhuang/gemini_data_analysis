So is there a way that we can simplify that process and and I don't know what the answer to that is, honestly, so.",

So you could talk about the vectors, you can talk about the livestock, you could talk um Jenny mentioned the fecal uh testing, you know, so you could test air, you could test insects, you could, you know, test so but we're always relying on a test if it's NGS based, we know what the genome is. So we can we can get you know, the known knowns, the some of the unknown knowns, but we can't get the unknown unknowns and that's a real challenge for finding the the the next uh uh outbreak or pandemic agent.",

I think what would be ideal is not the immuno compromise because then every non pathogenic thing will start killing it. Um secondly is the host species barrier. So like the receptors in human cells are really different from pigs, from cows and all of that. So if if pathogens cannot engage the human cell receptor, there's not going to be infection.",

But, um, so I I'm currently working on a sensor that is an implantable sensor that would measure say interfering gamma, right? So interfering gamma, I mean that could be anything, right? Could be viral, could be parasitic, could be bacterial. Um, but maybe we we switch it over, right? We make it, okay, it's going to be type one interference. So, you know, you you put this under the skin of an animal and when that animal gets a viral infection, you don't know what that infection is, uh, that sensor is capable of detecting circulating type one interferon alpha, let's say. And it triggers a change in that receptor, sends a radio frequency signal that can be read from an, you know, from an RF reader say at a water tank. Um, you know, inside a dairy at the milking parlor, right? And it tells you that that animal isn't like something is going on with that animal, right? And it may not tell you what it is, but it tells you that something is wrong with that animal. And again, you can you can um utilize that information with a bunch of other things, right? As I was mentioning before, you know, motion sensor activity, temperature as was being suggested earlier, right? You can have all these things that are feeding, they're sort of feeding the system. Um, and and yeah, sure. I I think the answer is, yeah, I think the technology is there, we we could do that.",
