At the end of the day, carbon will change to different forms. You're putting energy in some form, right? Hybrid means you're turning one form of energy to another one and feeding it to another unit. That's how you can view it. So for example, Betar's technology, if you want to get magnesium from for example magnesium silicon materials, if you need a lot of acid and base. If you can electrochemically make acid and base, there's so many decarbonization you can do. People don't think about it, right? So there are a lot of technologies out there already existing. Just doing bipolar membrane with the electrolysis, you can make huge amount of acid and base and it doesn't seem like it does do anything to carbon decarbonization or negative carbon technology, but like Betar is doing, in a sense that by putting them together, you're moving energy such a way that you can make it net benefit. I think that's what hybrid means in my opinion. Go ahead.",

            "transcript": "That that's absolutely what I think the key question is and can you create you almost need two very different reaction environments on different sides of a cell, right? So you basically want to be able to break down rocks, rocks are cheap and abundant, and then you want to be able to create rocks and then the thermodynamics has to work out and then the CO2 mass balance has to work out, which is the challenge. But what I find really exciting are these processes, you know, natural processes do this actually fairly well, they just do it very slowly and are very site specific and we have many logistical challenges and so on. So I find the idea of distributed mineralization very compelling where we can decouple it from geologic formations but then yeah, that's the key question.",

So with all of the approaches that are being proposed and specifically even the electro-biochemical integrated approaches, the the question of carbon negativity is something that I've not seen addressed or answered in any sort of detail, right? So so presumably what we're looking at, let's say it's an electrochemical process, the the amount, the CO2 emissions associated with the electrochemical or the electrical input need to necessarily be lower than the mitigation in CO2 output that is resulting from the process, right? So have you seen studies that address this question or do we is there a way or a framework even to discriminate between processes that are truly carbon negative versus those that would necessarily be carbon positive, right? And for folks that are working in the area like Chong clearly, is there I mean in terms of the fundamental science clearly there's a lot that is interesting that's going on. But are there are there options out there that are truly carbon negative or are we just doing fundamental science that is not leading to carbon negativity especially in the context of CO2 utilization?",

So you know when Google runs their their server farms, they buy renewable energy to do it. So the idea that you can run these electrochemical processes today on 100% renewable electricity is entirely reasonable. So the idea that you run your calculation as if it was grid electricity is I think just wrong. So that simplifies it a lot. You can assume that your electricity is carbon free and go ahead and do your chemistry.",

            "transcript": "So there was an earlier session had that report out just briefly about carbon negative technology, what does that mean? So you need to see you to the chemicals and fuels, usually the best you can do is carbon neutral. Because when you say carbon negative means that whatever carbon was in the atmosphere, which is a fossil based because we emitted more than we had to, we should have, and then went back into the earth so that there was a net negative direction. That's what negative technology means. If we keep circulating using that carbon above the ground, that's zero, right? So carbon neutral. So the reason a lot of times somehow CO2 utilization got lopsided with the conversion, negativity and all that so that we put it together, but I think it serves a very different role because at the end of the day, like this is not only about long bridge of CCUS, like from now on in the future if you care about climate change and the earth, you should stop using fossil carbon. So I don't even call it decarbonization of materials, it should be defossilization of materials because we can't without carbon you can't make anything. As long as that carbon came from air or somewhere, it'd be fine. So where should we get that carbon, that's the question, right? We are talking about that in a sense indirectly because there's one in air, one in ocean you talked about, and then also in rocks. So let's not touch the one in the rock because it already got stored and it doesn't move around, great, let's not touch that. Means that you have ocean or air only. That's why there's a lot of research on direct air capture and ocean capture, right? So that as long as you get those which is non-fossil carbon, you defossilize your chemical industry which should be forever and ever because we're never going to go back after lowering the CO2 concentration, taking out more fossil out of the ground millions of years from now, right? Hopefully not. So I think this is kind of new way of looking at the material cycle above the ground. So calculation of carbon negativity is kind of very tough on this case because you'll be best at best neutral.",

If I can dig out the good report, I'll share with you guys, but there are definitely many reports. Another thing is in order for CO2 conversion to chemicals and fuels, regardless any of the pathways you're talking about, hybrid or single or whatever, if you want to have a final product other than carbon, if you want to have hydrocarbon or polymers or whatever, then you need hydrogen. So cost wise, you're highly depending on the renewable energy, either electricity or heat. Second, how are you going to get carbon-free hydrogen at what cost? That makes a huge difference in techno-economic analysis as well as carbon footprint of the overall gain or loss or whatever it is. So there's a lot of people actually working on this area. Great group in Germany and Delft, both of them are doing really great work, Andreas and Andre, oh both start with A. They're great. And in US, we have great group at Argonne National Lab. They have a whole entire protocol, so LCA by EERE, how they're evaluating CO2 hybrid systems are the protocol is developed by Argonne National Lab. Michael Wong is a great person. He actually did the LCA for corn to ethanol long time ago, the correct version of it, not the incorrect version.",
