      "transcript": "It's a thing that you can't let stop you from thinking about clever ideas right now because there are some very strange ideas about what they should cost. People who think it should cost a small amount of money and it's not going to. We're we're going to pay to have our climate fixed. It's not going to be thousands of dollars but it's certainly going to be hundreds of dollars per ton and so don't let the cost be the thing that keeps you from developing these processes right now. But at the same time don't let yourself get trapped into you know like this discussion of about where you're going to get your calcium and magnesium ions. That's a big deal they're heavy. You have to think about those kinds of things but I would discourage you from thinking too much about the cost right now and more think about the overall systems. Land use is a big deal. You can come up with more money but you can't get more land. Things like that.",

      "transcript": "Following up on Roger and Alissa's comments I think one of the things this brings up is that if you're going to interface renewable energy with CO2 capture and utilization I think one thing that doesn't get enough attention in terms of creative ideas is now you're talking about energy inputs that vary as a function of time right and the question of not steady state chemical processes for making products but intermittent processes that are that are not only I think flexible towards intermittent energy inputs but also maybe take advantage of those spikes and you know troughs in energy input if you will maybe at a process level maybe at a molecular or atomic scale that's something that is a question I think that hasn't been asked to the best of my knowledge and I just wonder if there are following up on Roger's comment about trying to come up with creative solutions right are those variable energy input non-constant energy inputs do they allow you to allow you to develop molecules I don't know catalysts and processes and adsorbents that are atypical if you will for lack of a better term. That's something that just comes to my mind.",

So so at least and we we did experiments say that you just you don't need to feed the the intermediate feedstock for the microorganism all the time. You just and you can do it half a day and take another half day off and they they they preserve.",

      "transcript": "Interesting so Chong maybe if you maybe you can elaborate on that so if I think about as a as a person that's not not good with biology right I if I if I look at a classic noble metal catalyst or a metal oxide based catalyst I have to retain a certain chemical potential environment above the catalyst to let's say prevent it from deactivating or I have to I have to if I'm not operating my reactor for a certain period of time I have to be careful about what environment I expose it to so that. So what what about the biological system makes this not to be the case?",

      "transcript": "So I think biological system has a benefit is they are tested for millions of years under all the potential scenarios you you can think about that's called evolution. So what it means is that if you don't provide energy source for them for extended period of time they they anyone you see all the living organism you see here have been tested pressure tested already. So so in that context if you couple with electrochemistry with microorganism it doesn't mean you have to feed them all the time. Of course if you stop feeding them for a year they probably will die but if you don't feed them for a couple of days once you're providing energy again they pick up and they replicate themselves they grow and so the amount of you can if you think about microorganism as a catalyst the amount of catalyst you have is dependent on how much energy you're providing because they're self-replicating. You don't need to control how much catalyst you have there.",

      "transcript": "So if I can if I can maybe follow up and extrapolate on that so for example if I use a traditional non-biological catalyst right I would need to the catalysts are typically optimized for a certain set of reaction conditions. So let's say let's say in this particular case we're talking about a hybrid capture and conversion device right so let's say I'm capturing CO2 using from air using an absorption process and I put in a temperature input energy input to desorb CO2 at close to atmospheric pressure right. Let's say that if I have an intermittent energy input my concentration of CO2 can vary right. If I'm using a standard absorption process that that may not be the case but for an intermittent energy input let's say that sometimes my CO2 pressure is is let's say 0.1 bar and let's say sometimes it's 2 bar. Is it fair to say that if you had downstream a biological catalyst versus a traditional heterogeneous catalyst the biological catalyst would be less sensitive and more flexible to something like the the reaction temperature and the CO2 partial pressure that it could convert the CO2 at.",

When we in our system when we did experiment we have a gas tank of CO2 but sometimes we we get bored and we just blow our our breath into the reactor it works and that's much lower concentration of carbon dioxide and it also works. Um and one tricky thing about biological system is temperature. It's much and because um 35 degree they survive 40 degree they die. Um but beyond that um right because the temperature wise that's a much you need to have better control. Um but if you think about pressure wise they they they are much adaptive very adaptive to that.",

So you're saying that if I have a biological system that is converting CO2 downstream of my capture unit there's a maximum temperature that my desorption can occur at right that's what you're implying I think.",

      "transcript": "So what I would say is um because you know in biological a big issue in biological fermentator is the local heat because the biological metabolism is exothermic and so from engineering point of view you think about why sometimes a big fermentator has an issue you get if you if your fermentator beer it get too big sometimes the beer doesn't taste that good. Um partly because the heat is not uniform the temperature profile is not uniform anymore and the change of the um process there. Um so so in that is what I would say is a consideration is um biological system are much more sensitive to temperature because 35 degree they survive 40 degree they die. Um but beyond that um right because the temperature wise that's a much you need to have better control. Um but if you think about pressure wise they they they are much adaptive very adaptive to that.",
