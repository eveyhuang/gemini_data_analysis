      "transcript": "carbon mineralization as well and then interesting thing kind of bring it up about hybrid how to view hybrid technology right at the end of the day carbon will change to different forms you're putting energy in some form right hybrid means you're turning one form of energy to another one and feeding it to another unit that's how you can view it so for example Betar's technology if you want to get magnesium from for example magnesium silicon materials if you need a lot of acid and base if you can electrochemically make acid and base there's so many decarbonization you can do people don't think about it right so there are a lot of technologies out there already existing just doing bipolar membrane with the electrolysis you can make huge amount of acid and base and it doesn't seem like it does do anything to carbon decarbonization or negative carbon technology but like Betar is doing in a sense that by putting them together you're moving energy such a way that you can make it net benefit I think that's what hybrid means in my opinion go ahead",

      "transcript": "that that's absolutely what I think the key question is and can you create you almost need two very different reaction environments on different sides of a cell right so you basically want to be able to break down rocks rocks are cheap and abundant and then you want to be able to create rocks and then the thermodynamics has to work out and then the CO2 mass balance has to work out which is the challenge but what I find really exciting are these processes you know natural processes do this actually fairly well they just do it very slowly and are very site specific and we have many logistical challenges and so on so I find the idea of distributed mineralization very compelling that where we can decouple it from geologic formations but then yeah that's the key question",

      "transcript": "I have a a beef about the way a lot of people think about this is that people will imagine these electrochemical systems and then they'll use grid electricity to run them and that's wrong because today when people do big electrochemical processes just like any big electrical buyer they they buy dedicated sources so you know when Google runs their their server farms they buy renewable energy to do it so the idea that you can run these electrical chemical processes today on 100% renewable electricity is entirely reasonable so you know the the idea that you run your calculation as if it was grid electricity is is I think just wrong so that simplifies it a lot you can assume that your electricity is carbon free and go ahead and do your chemistry",

      "transcript": "so there was a earlier session had that report out just briefly about carbon negative technology what does that mean so you need to see it to chemicals and fuels usually the best you can do is carbon neutral because when you say carbon negative means that whatever carbon was in the atmosphere which is the fossil based because we emitted more than we had to we should have and then went back into the earth so that there was a net negative direction that's what negative technology means if we keep circulating using that carbon above the ground that's zero right so carbon neutral so the reason a lot of times carbon somehow CO2 utilization got lopsided with the conversion negativity and all that so that we put it together but I think it serves a very different role because at the end of the day like this is not only about long bridge of CCUS like from now on in the future if you care about climate change and the earth you should stop using fossil carbon so I don't even call it decarbonization of materials it should be defossilization of materials because we can't without carbon you can't make anything as long as that carbon came from air or somewhere it'd be fine so where should we get that carbon that's the question right we are talking about that in a sense indirectly because there's one in air one in ocean you talked about and then also in rocks so let's not touch the one in the rock because it got stored and it doesn't move around great let's not touch that means that you have ocean or air only that's why there's a lot of research on direct air capture and ocean capture right so that as long as you get those which is non-fossil carbon you defossilize your chemical industry which should be forever and ever because we're never going to go back after lowering the CO2 concentration taking out more fossil out of the ground millions of years from now right hopefully not so I think this is kind of new way of looking at the material cycle above the ground so calculation of carbon negativity is kind of very tough on this case because you'll be best at best neutral I totally agree and I think that's where we go wrong when you say one versus the other it serves a different purpose",
