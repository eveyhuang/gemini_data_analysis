            "transcript": "electrochemically or thermochemically. Once we have that, we can feed that to biological system which can upgrade to C2 plus much bigger molecule much more selectively. So interesting thing is people who are working on electrochemical conversion for example, they were all used to work on formic acid, producing formic acid because it's easiest. But then the problem with what Chong was saying, separation was an issue because it's highly dissolved in low concentration in the soup, right? So you have to get that out. So what you're saying, well, why don't we make CO or something else which bubbles out a little bit more so that there's inherent separation of your product so that you don't have energy penalty in the back end. But then now, if you want to attach the biological system, you degas your gas, gaseous product, now this low solubility gas you have to redissolve to feed it to the bug, which is not a good idea in a sense when you think about it. So now everybody's moving back to soluble intermediate, right? So that if I make formic acid and bugs can just continue to eat it up. But when you think about it, we're going to have intermittent renewable energy, making your intermediates intermittently, and then now you have a bugs producing whatever rate, can you turn on on and off on and off easily seamless this system? Or the pH condition which is favored in electrochemical system would be okay for bugs down in the downstream because fluid will go in around the circle. So there are a lot of questions and the good thing is this is really beginning of conversation. And I think that's why a lot of people are going into this.",

            "transcript": "Appreciate that because when I was a grad student when I did that, nobody else was thinking about it. But that was five years ago. So yeah and another thing I thought about is as you said that converting the CO in the intermediate, another drawback of CO is that CO is toxic, I mean to human being, so probably CO is could be also toxic to organisms. And so and and so that is an actual design engineering design challenge because you want to give them enough CO so it can be further upgraded, but you still want to make sure you don't give them too much CO so it will kill them. So so that is another challenge if you're using CO as an intermediate. Hydrogen fermentator as fermentation as Alissa said, that's one of the approach, but another approach at formate I think is gaining favor now again because the formate dehydrogenase is a very well very widespread enzyme to loop into the ATP synthesis synthesis pathways. So that is I think people are working on now. And but depending on the there are different ways you can design the process and there will be different challenges. I agree with that. And I appreciate ERE are interested about that because I was trying to find how which which which agency can fund our project. But thanks for letting me know about this.",

            "transcript": "Alright good. Go ahead. Okay. So so it depends right? It depends on what kind of microbe you're using. The the most appropriate and easier ones they make a tons of there are bacteria can make 99% of acetate. Bacteria can make 99% of methane or maybe 99 90% of polymer, polyhexanoate. You can directly get polymer out of CO2. We also work on bacteria that just fix ammonia, just fix nitrogen into ammonia. And we're and because they are bacteria that's a natural way of doing that. So is this their waste? Like they they release these things as waste? So so it really depends also depends. So in the case of acetate and methane, those are waste if they secrete it out. In the case of polymer, it's actually a rainy day fund for their energy budget. So what they do so they store the polymer inside their cell just in case that later they got starved they can reuse those. So that's a natural way they do it and but you can break up the cell later. That's why I talked about the separation challenge. You still need to break out the cell and you got a polymer out of that. In the case of of nitrogen, it's more complicated depending on the strain. If you think about natural symbiosis, actually bacteria secrete ammonia for plant to use. So those in that case it's a natural it's a soluble ammonia. But in other cases they make urea for themselves. And and in that case what we demonstrated is you don't need to separate those because it's organic fertilizer anyway. And those bacteria happen to be accumulate phosphate too. And if you think about the biggest use of ammonia it's a fertilizer. You have phosphate and nitrogen, it's the probably the best you want to get for the agriculture. So you don't need to you don't want you can just spray the bug in the field and that's how it works. But also sorry.",

So you know people have these systems that exist at the surface and you know you imagine things that you could plow in but that's pretty disruptive. So that combination of the the the chemistry of making fixed nitrogen and then delivering it to the roots that need it. If any of you could do that we'd be done. Just go ahead do that.",

            "transcript": "So it's already done and actually when I was a postdoc in Dan Nocera's lab at Harvard, we we I we have the technology and we patented and now it's a startup company now in Cambridge. What it does is we're using a microbe that it's a soil microbe anyway. It eats hydrogen and it fix carbon dioxide and nitrogen. It accumulate phosphate in the solution and you basically you apply electricity by generating hydrogen and the bug basically using hydrogen as an energy source to make itself, accumulate phosphate and polyphosphate and fix nitrogen, ammonia and carbon dioxide from the air. And what's beneficial more is as you know for agriculture there are people like to use plant hormones to stimulate the root development. And it turns out that bacteria because it's soil it has a loose loosely defined symbiotic relationship with plant with soybeans at least. So so if you spray that into the field using the microbe itself, not only provide nitrogen source, ammonia and phosphorus source, it also provides some organic stimulus that facilitate the development of root system. So so it's so we thought that's organic anyway it's organic because you can think of microbe as a bag, you have nitrogen, phosphate there. So it's also have a beneficial is leaching. You don't have much leaching because they are encapsulated by the cell membrane. So because a big issue about agriculture now is using synthetic fertilizer is if it rains they washed away but with the organism they don't.",
