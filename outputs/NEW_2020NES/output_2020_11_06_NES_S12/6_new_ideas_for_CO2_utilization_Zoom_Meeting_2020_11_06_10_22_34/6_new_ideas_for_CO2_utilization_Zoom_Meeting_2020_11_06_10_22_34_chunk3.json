Um another um thing I brought up in the last breakout session which is a little sort of interest of mine is thinking about whether you can capture stuff from the ocean as opposed to direct from air. Um you have a lot of carbonate in the ocean and you can think of the ocean as a big carbon sink so if there are ways you can take seawater and extract it sort of react bicarbonate um and you know take it take it out of the ocean water you essentially um have a way of sort of enabling um negative emissions that way as well.",

Um I'm we're working on uh trying to do essentially ex-situ mineralization uh but looking at how we can uh try to do away with the energy intensive regeneration step thermal regeneration step and do electrochemistry directly on the uh CO2 in solution and we've been trying to learn about the basically the science of how amines interact uh well we know the chemistry of course of how amines react with CO2 but we've been looking in some more complex environments beyond just aqueous so looking at um you can think about aqueous non-aqueous solvent blends uh if you're doing electrochemistry directly in the captured state it becomes complex because you have additional salts uh supporting electrolyte salts they can interact with amine carbamate ammonium in interesting new ways so uh you can get different kind of states in solution and then and then doing electrochemistry directly on that rather than on uh CO2 that's you know dissolved in aqueous in the kind of classical approach. And what we've found is um it's complicated if you try to do these reactions in aqueous it's not impossible it's very you know challenging to um to to do the analysis actually because you have many branching um pathways depending on how you prepare your electrolytes but we've been looking in non-aqueous systems so far and uh and see the feasibility that you can electrochemically cleave the nitrogen carbon bond directly and um take CO2 to something else if you can make it if you give it a very strong thermodynamic sink like to make a carbonate an alkali carbonate it works fairly well and you can um go directly you know CO2 all the way to a carbonate in a reactor but then the question is you've got the price of making the co-reactant so we don't get like a calcium ions or magnesium ions for free and so thinking about how you actually when you expand the box and uh where where do you source whatever you're mineralizing CO2 with uh that's always a challenge so if you can source that from somewhere like ocean water you know maybe there's some kind of hybrid concept there but but that's the challenge uh how do you make it really um you know net removal of CO2 because you have to create the reactive ions. So that's something that we're we're looking very closely at right now.",
