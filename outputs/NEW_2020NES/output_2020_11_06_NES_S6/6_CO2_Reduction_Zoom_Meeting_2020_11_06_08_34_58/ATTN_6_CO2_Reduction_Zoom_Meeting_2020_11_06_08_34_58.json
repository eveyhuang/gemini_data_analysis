      "transcript": "think about this. The good thing about moleculars are that they're more selective for single things and you can tune them but then the bad thing there are issues with stability and and things like that, leaching, stuff like that. But I think a lot of people because they've usually worked in inorganics, a lot of people discount them and that's a very fair criticism but you can mimic organic environments by using relatively cheap polymer materials. In terms of control transport of water and protons and stuff and I think I don't think that's been figured out because I don't think a lot of people look at that because a lot of people that would be well poised to look at that discount molecular systems because of the problems that they have.",

And that is in order to drive down costs using like single atom catalysts where you have a more expensive atom that's kind of embedded in a cheaper material.",
