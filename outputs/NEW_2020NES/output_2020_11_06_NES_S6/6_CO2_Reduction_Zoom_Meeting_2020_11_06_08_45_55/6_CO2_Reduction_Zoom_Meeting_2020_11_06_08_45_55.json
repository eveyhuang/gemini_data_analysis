            "transcript": "So a comment coming back to what what's been discussed a lot is, so Jimmy and Venkat you're discussing kind of techno-economic type of things and costs of catalysts and Venkat you brought up Opus 12 and Dioxide. So we work with both of those companies and at NREL we've done pretty extensive techno-economic and life cycle assessment of various CO2 to processes and what we see is when you get to scale, the cost of the catalyst is nothing. We assume that every catalyst will be bulk copper so it absolutely is not the catalyst cost and for PEM electrolysis where you have platinum and iridium based catalysts, that's a huge driver, but for CO2 reduction it's not. And so what we find is regardless if we do the Opus 12 approaches using PEM electrolysis essentially with CO2 catalysts so it's in an acidic environment and Dioxide does alkaline electrolysis with CO2 and in both cases when we get to the economy of scales, whether it's acidic or basic, the major cost driver and the major cost at these systems is the cost of the membranes. And so I think as we for this room of a complete picture of CO2 reduction, I think membranes is a huge thing especially alkaline exchange membranes in terms of separations, stability, managing pHs, but we even find in the manufacturing that at large scales when we get to over 10,000 units made of of any of these systems including things like bipolar plates, recirculation. So the first thing is that membranes is something I think that is it's huge and important for for this field. The other thing is that Venkat you're mentioning that the the price of electricity and how we kind of distill that into metrics in the lab that are the most relevant that are correlated to that, the two metrics we see that are the biggest knobs to turn are the single pass conversion efficiency and the current density. So the current density and it's it's a challenge I think, a big challenge for the field in that those two metrics seem to be counterproductive to each other. If you increase the current density, you usually decrease the single pass conversion and vice versa. If you have low flow rates to have a higher conversion efficiency, you're going to have lower currents. So we see that the biggest economic knobs to turn are the membrane costs and the biggest performance metrics are current density and single pass.",

So if we can have membranes that are more stable, even if they're a little more expensive, that would win out in the end. So it's both the bulk cost of the polymers and the the synthesis and we're taking into account, you know, roll-to-roll synthesis as they already use. So we're using that part of the analysis has a smaller error bar because that's already an industrially relevant process. We get really good numbers about that. So it's bulk polymer costs and then alkaline exchange membrane fabrication.",

So I'm just curious, from the from the industry perspective, is it possible to use any membrane-free flow reactors? I'm asking this is because I also work in the battery field and I know these days people are starting working on membrane-free battery systems and in terms of the battery systems and the electrocatalysis system, they share something in common like the catholyte and the anolyte. So is it possible that people can use some techniques in the in the battery field and apply that membrane-free technique and use that for for electrocatalysis?",

There's a great paper by Matt Kanan in the past two weeks about essentially if you do CO2 electrolysis, if you want to get high selectivities and high currents, people use very alkaline environments and hydroxide reacts with CO2 faster than you're going to do it electrochemically. So industrially, a lot of the information we're getting is that they say that they can take CO2 and do they can make CO via solid oxide electrolysis very well and very high rates. If we could do CO electrolysis, then that opens up the space because there's no equilibrium between CO and hydroxide, there's no consumption. You tune things and you kind of cut off the carbonate problem and then you can get into things where membraneless reactors may be interesting because you're not so worried about separating the electrolyte from CO2. So I think that the kind of the design space of CO electrolysis may open up a lot more doors than just the pure CO2 electrolysis.",
