      "transcript": "used for peroxides. Obviously, I mean there's existing industries like paper and pulp. But there's actually really interesting synergies if you look at because maybe the complex part then is you've got this electrolyte laying around that you've driven it in. But in some cases sulfates or acetates, you can form like the hydroperoxy acetate molecules and these can actually then enhance subsequent like downstream catalysis applications, which is really kind of neat. Is that, sorry, just as where to put that. I feel like electrifying peroxide production and sort of electrifying hydrogen production are maybe along the similar lines of what is a negative versus a neutral emission because I don't know also what the balance is of of emissions for the for the anthraquinone process for like for as hydrogen for example, for every one one ton of hydrogen, I think you produce eight tons of CO2 if you use a steam methane reforming.",

There actually are there's a company in Ontario called Planetary Hydrogen that's doing negative emissions H2 gas production using electrochemical separation of seawater. So they add a mineral salt to seawater, they produce H2 gas and they also produce hydroxide ions that go back in the seawater that can then absorb more carbon dioxide. So there are these interesting sort of negative emissions pathways for H2 production.",

What are the most reasonable targets to to go after? I don't have an answer to this question. It's kind of I think actually the discussion is kind of interesting because it it kind of canvases a little bit all the different possibilities. What I what I find the most interesting so far almost is is actually the the idea of going to graphitic carbon electrochemically. Because that would then be a completely almost unexplored negative emissions technology. For for really terminal storage of of carbon dioxide if we actually want to get it out of the atmosphere.",

We would need to check the number but some people say like we we take all this we make all the plastics in this world out of the CO2 you take from the atmosphere, we have not changed so much.",

Essentially the same thing that you're saying.
