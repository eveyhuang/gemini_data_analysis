      "transcript": "So I want to throw out something about BECCS. I don't know how many folks have talked about thought about that technology. I find it fascinating from an engineering perspective because one of the interesting things about biomass as an energy source or a feedstock for anything is that it's very distributed. So if you manage start to think about BECCS as a power source as well as a way to produce negative emissions, you're now talking about very distributed CO2 or carbon storage. And so that leads me to thinking about a future landscape that has either a massive amount of CO2 pipelines if we're going to sequester CO2 geologically or a massive reliance on biochar and the associated costs with shipping solids around for sequestration. And so I'm just I'm unsure which of those two is is lower hanging fruit and more likely to be attainable in the in the short term because both from a systems engineering and logistics perspective seem complex to me. But if you look at climate models, there's always a massive amount of BECCS that's suggested as a solution for our negative emissions challenge. And in principle the two parts are there, bioenergy and carbon capture and sequestration, but putting them all together into a system seems really challenging to me.",

      "timestamp": "03:01-03:59",
      "transcript": "I can jump in with a thought that I've discussed with one of my colleagues, Jeff Coates who's a big CO2 to polymers researcher about trying to do it's something we're not doing anything with this. It's two chemists talking but about doing you know BECCS but where the instead of sequestration you you then feed the CO2 you capture into a CO2 polymerization site and you essentially attach a biomass to CO2 unit onto your CO2 polymer facility and you can use the energy perhaps to you can make this little self-sustained essentially factory. I don't know if the economics of that could ever become reasonable but that's something we've thought about as a way to avoid the like you said this landscape of CO2 piping seems unreasonable to me that we're going to have all these pipes running all over just moving CO2 underground but I don't know what your thoughts are about you know more about this than I do.",

      "transcript": "Yeah if you do a sort of a geographic analysis of the places where you can grow enough biomass with the places where you can also do sequestration so you don't need to have all these pipelines, it gives you a you know an array of areas and there there are quite a few where you could successfully do BECCS. So I do think BECCS has got a a real positive potential and a and a bright future but as a non not a systems engineer it does it does seem from a systems perspective complex to me. Is there anything in our spreadsheet that we haven't yet covered? And that's spreadsheet I guess it's we've talked plenty about nitrogen to ammonia so I guess we've covered it.",
