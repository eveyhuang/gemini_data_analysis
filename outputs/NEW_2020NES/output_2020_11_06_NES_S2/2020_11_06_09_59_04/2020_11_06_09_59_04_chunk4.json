The the big question here about how do we facilitate this conversations I mean that's what research corporation is doing with this conversation because I think you know until you sit down and have conversations with people the vocabularies are different and it's hard for people you know just by reading the paper to figure out can I work in this area and a half hour conversation can make it clear whether you know you could offer something to this and you might be able to do a collaboration. So having more gatherings like this is definitely was something that would be a great way to continue to facilitate those conversations and get down more into the nitty gritty.",

So yeah just more more public venues so tutorial sessions at conferences on top of the perspective articles.",

And I'm talking about in a way that is digestible to the average experimentalist because you know most of the things you find in theory journals and computational journals if you're most people look at it and then after you get through with the introduction it's like okay what does this mean and if you don't have somebody to break it down for you you know so I guess that goes back to the education component because we at least in most places we don't teach this early on so you know most people learn these things at in the graduate level.",

So is there a way for us to actually go back a little bit and can we think about the challenges that we have in this area right and then we can think about well how can we solve it experimentally experimentalist experimentally and if we cannot then is there a way for us to solve these challenges theoretically or guide theory in such a way that we can come up with an answer or vice versa. So can we actually think about what are the challenges that we have when it comes to negative emissions or carbon capture.",
