You're a lot of big assumptions that are being made, so the theory is not as accurate. So you really need to know if it works. So you need to have data that you can say, oh, this makes sense, that we're actually can trust this model so that when we apply it to something that's a related system, we feel like we've got a good handle on this. Or or even to know what your error bars are, right?",

And so this question of how you go from those calculations up to the scale of what actually is put into a device, right? So even in the bench scale experiments, you can have an idealized model system that you're looking at, but then if we're talking about going all the way to putting it into some sort of device, the manufacturing and fabrication is not going to be as perfect and how do you account for, let's say defects or other issues that kind of arise in the overall machine that'll affect the performance or device.",

And if they have a conversation with theoreticians, they can see if there's a common ground. And it can go the other way as well. But I think for a lot of theoretical people, they want to know what the experimental problem is so that they can apply what they know to and try to make this most the best progress possible. And they have to do it hand in hand with the with the experimental people to make sure that they're like I said, grounded in reality.",

Maybe a call for experimentalists to design systems that are slightly more idealized that that can be handled and kind of bridged for theory.",

You know they're they're not completely representative of what a polydisperse you know nanoparticle kind of catalyst system is going to look like in the end but if you do single crystal work on all the different facets and then try to interpret the nanoparticle as as kind of a combination of those, you you can start you know it takes a lot of data but but you can kind of start to build a a real understanding of the the more messy experimental system if you have lots of information from more idealized systems.",

So when I was working with experimentalists and I always like to ask them to also can they measure some like more well-known system and I could also try to simulate on the simulation can well reproduce that because when they are synthesizing new materials there could be some defect and something else I mean we just don't know so I mean I always love to just pick up a few simple system I mean well-known system not simple and try to start to work from there to see whether we can get the same I mean at least to make sure that the theory and experiments they are on the same page.
