      "transcript": "prototype systems out there maybe on two hands but it's a pretty low number of prototype or pilot scale direct air capture systems. So this you know doing the capture and we've to Luisa's point right we we've kind of approached direct air capture of okay I'm used to doing gas separations how can I apply technology I have in hand to this problem of direct air capture and and it's akin to saying how you know how the locomotive engineers laughed at the Wright brothers for trying to make an airplane. You know and ultimately the Wright brothers didn't design a train that could fly they made a plane. So I think we have to rethink our approach to the capture side both from a materials and a systems perspective.",

      "transcript": "Along those lines Matt I think you pointed out a good thing with this development of even if you have a material that seems like it might be good how do you integrate that into some sort of system right and and the cost and the time etc with doing that is is great right and so especially with with COVID things are shutting down even further but can you use computational methods to help accelerate that design and make it more effective and efficient so that you're spending your time and money more wisely. And that gets back to I know I've heard a couple people say about multi-scale right so my modeling could help on a system level design perhaps how how fast the air is flowing what kind of thicknesses we want for these etc. But it's not unless I get parameterization or information from DFT or experiments I can't tell you exactly what the reactions look like right I need somebody to tell me that so I can integrate it. And then you also get into the issue which we haven't really brought up of or maybe we have a little bit uncertainty analysis or uncertainty and its propagation right so if you're doing a DFT model there's an uncertainty and you propagate that to MD there's an uncertainty if you make that big jump to trying to model a device what about all that uncertainty and you need to compound all that to understand I think you said it a moment ago Matt risk right the risk associated with this.",

They've had for a number of years the carbon capture simulation initiative that they started back in maybe 2010-ish but that was looking at this idea for one specific device they were looking at post-combustion capture using sorbents and then they've moved a bit into solvents but asking exactly this of how can we go from a material that will work through a device into a power plant how that affects the long-term risk and everything and that was a big conversation that's been had around it and it's still going on more with industry now but the idea of trying to accelerate the whole process using computation and statistics.",

And the way I think about it is usually we do a life cycle assessment at the end of everything but shouldn't we be doing it as a way to screen new materials? So you could start and say you know I'm thinking about these materials or I'm thinking about these methods and do a carbon balance if the carbon doesn't work out you know it can point us to what materials or methods might be most advantageous from a negative emission standpoint and then further focus our experimental methods on those.",
