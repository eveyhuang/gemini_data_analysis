      "transcript": "At the sake of preaching to the choir, on heterogeneous surfaces it was pointed out this gets trickier because you have multiple sites and and then there's going to be multiple barriers that you're thinking about for for different processes that are occurring. In terms of overpotentials, those are related to to the activity and so there's multiple overpotentials for what activity you want to get. At least in the field of homogeneous electrocatalysis, I think there these things are a little bit more worked out in terms of their Tafel relationships and extracting rate constants for a for a process or a maximum turnover frequency. And in principle you can relate that back then to activation energies if you if you take into account the Eyring relationship.",
