But of course, surface-enhanced Raman, tip-enhanced Raman type things, you're limited by sticking some sort of metal tip or something in there. I also did want to loop back to Gary's point about the catalysts that are easier to measure not necessarily being the best ones. From the computational side, I don't see that as necessarily being a problem because if we have somewhere where we can validate our methods and figure out what features do need to be included and don't need to be included, even if it's not the best catalyst, then that's still really valuable for us.",

I mean, because we we can measure product distributions and then when we know that many of the cells that we use for spectroscopy actually they do not have the same mass transport properties. Then you will see unless you're able to do both things at the same time, spectroscopy and product detection, it's very difficult to relate the the activity and selectivity of one catalyst that we see in a reactor to what you see in in during the spectroscopy analysis. So it's challenging but I see obviously people working on this efforts and yeah, it's a challenge.",
