      "transcript": "So I have a question that is perhaps a little more fundamental. So in the context of trying to actually capture CO2 from air, there is the enthalpy contribution which is trying to bind the CO2 to the surface and then there's the entropic contribution where we can effectively engineer a substrate so we can lock the CO2 molecule into that particular pore space. In the context of direct air capture, how important are entropic contributions like in terms of the energetic input, should we even does it even make sense for us to think about engineering materials for from an entropic capture point of view or does it simply make sense for us to just think about trying to engineer the enthalpic component of it. That is so I wasn't sure what the current thinking is along those lines.",

      "speaker": "Jarad Mason",
      "timestamp": "01:29-02:35",
      "transcript": "Yeah I mean I think you pay a really large entropic penalty for CO2 going from being free in the gas phase to confined on a surface and so if you can do anything by inducing an increase in the entropy of a material when it binds CO2 to kind of compensate for that then you can favor the absorption of more CO2 and potentially reach higher capacities at these lower partial pressures. But like Chris said I think it is a very unexplored kind of area. It's less obvious to me I mean usually the enthalpy and entropy of absorption should be quite highly correlated because the more stronger the binding site you have for the gas the more constrained it is going to be on the surface and so there's usually not that much you can really do which is why maybe it makes sense just to focus on binding energy because the entropy is just going to kind of tag along. But that's where I think if you have more dynamic adsorbents or sorbents and things that respond and are not just inert materials but actually change in terms of the dynamics or structure as a function of CO2 partial pressure then you open up opportunities for thinking about engineering entropy.",

      "transcript": "I think a lot of classical adsorbents if you go to textbooks right are solid rigid materials where the entropy of adsorption on the surface at different sites is not terribly different. But a lot of the dynamic materials whether it be the moffs that you're familiar with Jared from your past history or solid ionic liquid hybrids, supported liquid phases, polymeric structures that have chain mobility, those are all things where you can engineer the entropic term such that you have very different entropies of adsorption.",

      "transcript": "So from a big idea basic energy science point of view does it make sense for us to start thinking a little bit more systematically about how we can engineer or if there are limits to that entropic term what might those limits be. If there are correlations obvious correlations with respect to enthalpy what might those relationships look like. Are there limits in terms of performance in these unconventional solvent sorbent type systems that we can now start to quantify or maybe try to get a handle on. I think it seems like a rich area for computations as well as for experiments.",

It's something that has been done in say you know flow batteries where we've done some work but lots of other areas too so that might be that might be an area that's ripe for some computational work.",

You know that has to be a cycle right that has to be a cycle to refine it so that is a very interesting route and something you know I would agree basic energy point of view definitely you know really appealing.",

      "transcript": "Can I ask a question based on that because a lot of the computational material screening for separations that I'm familiar with leverages the fact that people work with primarily crystalline materials that allows for this high throughput screening to be more effective. If we're talking about materials where we want to look at entropic terms there's a higher likelihood that we're going to be dealing with amorphous domains and I and I not being a computational scientist I'm less aware about how amenable those types of materials are you know less crystalline materials to these sort of high throughput techniques.",

      "transcript": "I would agree with that. Specifically when you you know lose crystallinity you are going to probably run into some of this trouble while you are screening why because we cannot generalize some of the properties basically and the structures you might encounter every process has to again come back down to thermodynamics to make sure they are stable from what we are predicting otherwise it's not going to make sense. We might predict a structure but it might seem pretty much garbage at that point. So you know and that's why a lot of those screenings and throughput chemistries are run through as you exactly said more you know systems where we have better control we understand them better. Amorphous as soon as you go there it's I would say yes definitely something where maybe improvements can be made actually that is also again a target area",
