So what I thought we would do to get started is just to take a few seconds, maybe 45 seconds, a minute, and just think about our topic here at hand and can we try to identify some knowledge gaps and some directions that we can go in to fill these gaps. And then we'll go around the room and do introductions. So just take 45 seconds to a minute right now, just thinking about combining experiment and theory and how we can use theory to design and explain experiments and experiments to validate theory. And not just materials but even more broadly to all kinds of science related to energy capture, how do you blend experiment and modeling. I'll give it 45 seconds starting now.",
