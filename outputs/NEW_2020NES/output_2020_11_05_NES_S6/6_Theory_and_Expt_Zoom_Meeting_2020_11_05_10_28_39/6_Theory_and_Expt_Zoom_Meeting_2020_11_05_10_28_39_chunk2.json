For example can we really reach the steady state right so that that will give us ample time to do the to do the interfacial probing without any concern. But I guess that's always a concern that are undergoing electrochemical reactions there's always some sort of degradation ongoing. So the true the real steady state is never achieved.",

Just trying to think of the things you can do to probe what you're actually interested in and recognizing that by every time we do this I mean it's it's the Schrodinger's cat is we're we're altering our system. So even the degradation induced by shooting x-rays at it or even freezing and rearranging the water structure or the salvation of ions at your surface which is critical to understand these interactions and you would change it by freezing. But I do think that would be even on a more fundamental level understanding the impacts of these different perturbations on your system is is really interesting.",
