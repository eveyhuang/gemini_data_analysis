You do explosives, you have this expansion wave model. I was wondering what would be the model system for let's say we're talking about probably catalysis or we're probably talking about prediction of spectra. What would be a model system? Would it be the hydrogen atom or the hydrogen molecule? Would it be and something that we can converge with experiments that we can absolutely say we're comparing apples to apples, right? So because I think what we learned from early theory and experiments was that if we have a model system that is simplistic enough but it's accurate enough between experiment and theory, we can understand the basics that then we can go into messy, more messy experiments.",

This is a very common starting point, but the challenge is, just talking about the copper itself, they are very mobilized atoms on themselves when you apply a potential to it. So during the experiment, the surface actually structure changes dramatically. I think there are a few papers from JCAP over the past couple of years, they discovered this kind of phenomenon, they sort of they call the restructuring catalyst surface during the reaction conditions. Even just from the experimental side, it is already a challenge. So, I don't know how much that will help the theoreticians to to do their model. I guess on the modeling side, we always start with one particular facet, right? If you're trying to model a cluster, I think the computational demand will be go way higher.",

And if you're even looking at mechanisms, the types of questions we would like to answer about mechanisms is where does the electron and proton go first? But that's already assuming maybe a proton-coupled electron transfer, which in a number of these systems, if you do pH dependent studies, you show that the rate determining step is not PCET. So I have yet to, maybe I'm looking in the wrong spaces, but find models that look at non-PCET steps as a part of the reaction mechanism. And so I think the layers of questions that we have here are are quite deep.",

I think I'm trying to brainstorm, okay? It's a sudden question for me. So I would say, you need to think about the interfacial, right? No matter it's battery or electrocatalysis system, you need to think about interfacial. You need to think about what's the electrochemical double layer structure there. How electrolyte affect the transportation of your substrate, like your CO2 gas. And also how the electrolyte interact with the catalyst surface, I would say, if you have heterogeneous catalyst, right? So then in this regarding, so I think I don't think people have talked about in this room yet. So probably molecular MD simulation is very important. And the point is even for your substrate of CO2, because when you're approaching to the electrode, the real structure, no matter electrolyte or dissolved substrate, they always affected by the applied potential at the electrode. So that means you have to apply, it can be very informative to do MD simulation with varied electrode potential, I would say.",

And from some previous work I've done on surfaces with self-assembled monolayers on gold, just looking at a really simple transformation, like a proton transfer essentially, potential-dependent protonation or deprotonation on the surface. It seems like charge or ion pairing at the interface is really important and that does not seem to be taken into account with with sort of the implicit solvation or ion pairing. So it seems like that would be an area where I wonder if we actually could just start on an even simpler scale for a model system and not jump straight to electrocatalysis, but maybe start building model systems with something that doesn't involve short-lived intermediates that are difficult to see spectroscopically and just build up the theory that some people here have mentioned. You've said, you know, talking about trying to develop more advanced computational techniques if we start with a simpler chemical system where we're not making products catalytically. I wonder if that could be a place to start.",
