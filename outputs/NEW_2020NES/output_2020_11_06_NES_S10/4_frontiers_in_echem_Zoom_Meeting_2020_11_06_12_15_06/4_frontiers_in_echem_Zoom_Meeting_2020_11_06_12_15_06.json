I'm also working on a project on electrochemical CO2 capture and concentration. To go with the question on your last proposal title, I think the most recent one I submitted was developing new strategies for suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction. Oh yeah, but I don't want to be my picture. They they don't know that it's ours. Like it's just robots. Oh really? They're called bot one, bot two, bot three. They should have the name called bot. Yeah, yeah, that's what all of the NREL sessions just bot one, bot two, bot three. And then Adam's partner. Yesterday was just me and three scientists at NREL. And like I can't even.

So the topic that you are here for you signed up for is Frontiers of Electrochemistry, which is a topic that is very close to my heart because as some of you have noticed, I've changed my background. I run a program in the summer for one week that is student-centric and it's precisely on the frontiers of electrochemistry. So I was very happy to see this topic come up and that's why I signed up for it. So I figured in the spirit of the topic I would change my background to make it even more, you know, frontiery. The mechanics that has worked pretty well in my opinion is for me to give you one or two minutes to think about a key idea that you think has to do with frontiers of electrochemistry.

Basically if you look at that slide, some of the you know, questions that may spark some ideas are, can novel materials and electrode architectures facilitate CO2 capture and utilization? And what are the fundamental design principles for electrocatalysts and how can their discovery and optimization be accelerated? Based on things that I've heard in this program, I think that you could very well think more broadly than CO2. There seems to be an opportunity gap with other molecules that are much less talked about. Methane is one that seems to be bubbling up, no pun intended, in this program. So I wonder if there's an opportunity there that we could fill and maybe even use to seek funding from this from this agency. So think electrochemistry broadly to get stuff out of the way and turn them into perhaps something useful. And I think that Jenny brought up the issue of whether CO2 to fuels is you know, really negative emissions. I don't think you should get very bogged down by that. You should just discuss the electrochemistry question more than the application question. But you could also spin it around and say, you know, can you take it a step further and instead of turning it into CO2 to fuels, can you think about CO2 or methane to plastics, which is a much more permanent way of getting the CO2 out instead of creating a new cycle. So I don't even know if that's possible, but just to get out of that little trap that you may fall in if you really want to talk about the electrochemistry itself. So with that, just you know, quick motivating speech. Let me give you one or two minutes to write down or think in your head what would be the key idea that you would like to put forward and to get the conversation started and then we'll just go from there.",
