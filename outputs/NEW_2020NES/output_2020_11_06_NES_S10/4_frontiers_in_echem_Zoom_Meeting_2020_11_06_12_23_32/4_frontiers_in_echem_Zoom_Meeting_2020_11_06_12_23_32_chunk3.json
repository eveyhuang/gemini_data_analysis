And then ECS, you know, I think generally doesn't have too much heterogeneous catalysis. So, so I think there's not it's not clear that there's an easy bridge to be to be formed. And I think, you know, I guess, you know, in terms of communities, I think it's it's not they see it as competing, right? I mean, I think it's it's a little like batteries versus fuel cells, right? I think I think it's which is why I guess, you know, the DOE merit review now they they the two are now no longer together. So, it's I think it's it's not obvious that there is actually any serious venue that brings a bridge between those two communities.",

But I do I do think that I don't it's kind of like fuel cells and uh batteries shouldn't be competing. They're they're different applications, right? And so that should that's a you know, hopefully a misnomer. But I I do think the thermocatalysis community there's a you know, advent of like dynamic catalysis and people are applying biases and people are looking at how Exxon Mobile and all these industries are want to electrify these processes in some sort. So I don't know. I I think that that that may just be time and adoption. But I do think I do think thermocatalysis people are coming around to electrochemistry.

You know, what else is stopping us from you know, manipulating things at the levels that you would like to manipulate them? What's stopping us from doing the cascade reaction the way that you know, a cell would a biological cell would do? That's what cells do, right? They do cascade reactions all the time. Or you know, manipulating that those local reactions that are happening you want to see happening side by side, right? That local galvanic cell that also you know why aren't we doing that now?

I mean, you think about people studying things like CO reduction or other downstream products, there just haven't been as much of that. And so I think it's just I don't know if it's I don't know I don't know why that is, but you know, you think about since we've had so much trouble getting selective selectivity for more complex products that that would be sort of the next step is can we take some of the things that we can make cleanly and use those as feedstocks for additional reduction reactions.",

There's you know, singular people with sort of unwavering intention to disrupt a field. Uh so I think it requires, you know, those kinds of instigators that uh would be able to raise obscene levels of capital, right? I mean you you need a you know, billion dollar worth of uh you know, money in some form, right, whether it's directly to R&D or or whatever, but like to to get a a thriving sort of initial ecosystem around which you can move forward. So, I think uh I think this field is sort of uh lacking that.

Uh so so and and I think if you think about it, right, I think uh you know, uh this is like saying that I mean the advantage that you know, some of the other industries have is you can sort of sell something intermediate uh and make money and then slowly move. Maybe this is possible here also, but the the in order to compete, right, you you you need a a massive reactor which is uh which is when you can compete with other ways of making uh chemicals or fuels. So I think that's scale is maybe one one challenge that there maybe there are not easy intermediate products that could get us to to that scale. Um but I don't see a fundamental reason, right? I mean, I think there's no there's actually no real reason that you couldn't imagine that uh you know, we couldn't have uh you know, another uh sort of giant instigator that takes over this field and says, okay, we're we're going to go all in on this, right? We're going to raise a billion dollars, uh we're going to go all in, uh and and this is it, right? This is the problem of our generation.",

There are already existing processes that are large scale that have a very cheap feedstock and relatively efficiently and stably can make something. So it's not that we can't make it's not that we're trying to make some product that's never been made before. The problem is the competition. It is so cheap and so large scale already that our I mean it's you know I I agree with Venkat. I mean there's not a thermodynamic or fundamental scientific reason we can't do these things, but in terms of cost, I mean even if you throw a billion dollars at it, it's still going to be way cheaper for Shell or Exxon to continue what they're doing, pay their carbon tax, and they will be just fine financially, which is you know, we have to remind ourselves that business is involved in this. So I think that the the biggest issue is that we're competing with existing technologies that have been around for a long time, are large scale, and very very cheap and efficient.",
