            "transcript": "Okay maybe maybe I'll start. I'll take the second part of the question which is on how can their discovery and optimization be accelerated. I think electrochemistry in terms of a discipline is one where progress has been extraordinarily slow, which is because of the fact that it's a very complex system, many interacting components, needing learning, and by learning I mean you do some experiment or you do some simulation and you want to answer some hypothesis, right? And often the ratio of the number of number of experiments or number of simulations run to test a hypothesis is very very high. And that has to do with the fact that getting high quality data is very difficult. So I think here I think there's going to be a significant advancement possible especially in this sort of very complex space of CO2 where you have many different control variables, many different design variables. So I think robotic experimentation and machine learning I think is going to fundamentally alter this this space and it's going to be a frontier that electrochemistry could be very well positioned to to spearhead because a lot of the setups that we need actually are conducive for being able to do automated experiments and may not require like human handling and so on. Like doing things with like robotic arms and so on is much harder than being able to automate like flow through type setups. So I think that that aspect I think could be one that I feel very passionately about as sort of the next frontier for electrochemistry.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, so I totally agree with Venkat. The process right now for catalyst discovery is slow. We focus a lot in our group on trying to understand the mechanism and pathways to figure out which are the key steps because oftentimes selectivity for example is determined at some common intermediate that can either react with protons or CO for example and that sort of dictates what happens in the rest of the reaction. So I think I'm very in favor of using machine learning to help us discover catalysts but I think right now in some cases we don't know what the question is if that makes sense. Like what are the key bond making breaking steps what are the key intermediates in different reaction pathways that we need to understand in order to innovate selectivity. And for the first question which is about novel materials and electrode architecture I have two thoughts on that and one is that transport for capture is important because it's dilute and that's something I didn't appreciate until I started talking to engineers. And then the other thing is that can we design architectures that can do cascades because the more I do catalyst design I realize that it's hard to optimize a single catalyst to go through several steps but if you can optimize a sequence of them and then organize them then that could be a way to get better selectivity.",

            "transcript": "Yeah I mean just to add into that point about setting up cascades and stuff I mean one this is one reason that looking beyond kind of the classic well-characterized electrode materials onto things that are you know kind of poly-elemental possibly and carry a variety of different distinct catalytic sites that could set up that sort of cascade is really attractive but that also presents an even harder characterization problem and kind of throughput problem because once you have a more complicated material structure composition it becomes harder to tune and kind of evaluate things independently.

Throughput computing combined with you know machine learning or trying to understand you know what targeted properties we are looking for. For example a lot of good electrocatalysts are available right. We also want to make sure is there a route to also find cost effective materials. For example platinum is not going to be the only answer every time for instance we try to do something like this. Quite famously the system here it works well but we are not going to sequester carbon dioxide using platinum. So that's where probably machine learning or you know modeling can also work with experiment to try to optimize. And I think that that could be really challenging but I think it's it's a fascinating route to follow actually.",

So you know in in all of these cases we need to run our oxidations opposite reductions and so you need to think about compatible reactions that are going to run on similar scales and you know basically how to sort of match match your chemistries so that we're not doing you know if we're doing a reduction do we really just want to make O2 at the other electrode or do we want to incorporate some value added oxidation and what are the logistics and kind of what what reactions or combinations of reactions that we we choose to pair with with a larger scale one.",

Perhaps there is something there as well where I have seen a lot of usage in you know different catalytic properties. Maybe somewhere there is a way to explore other materials as well rather than just the traditional ones we have looked at so far and maybe there is definitely an opportunity where a computational setup can actually make it cheaper. We don't always have the experimental means or the you know power to keep refining all those things right but at the same time we can have a effort even targeted just to something which has not done just like you know some materials which have never been thought about for you know electrocatalysis. It's worth trying it out when we have a chance.",
