Okay, so we'll go around the room and name and affiliation and a very short like high-level description of research interests. In the previous breakout, at least I had the idea of sharing the title of your last submitted proposal which I thought was cute. If you want to do that then you know go ahead. But yeah but keep it brief so that we can get going. I'm going to start. My name is Jordi Cabana and I'm in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I am trained as a solid-state chemist who went into electrochemistry through batteries and realized that transition metal compounds do electrochemical reactions that are interesting beyond batteries and now I have a smaller effort on electrocatalysis as well and that's one of the reasons why I'm here. I am going to call names and I'm going to call you based on how I see you in my screen. I have you all in this mosaic. So I'll say your name and you go ahead and introduce yourselves. Sen.",
