The other problem is that as you start oxidizing it the CH bonds get weaker and weaker and become easier to activate even under ambient conditions. So if you have something that's active enough to activate methane it's easier to activate the products in almost all cases.

Uh the second level is that when you project climate change going forward you get a lot of methane release from natural systems it's not just permafrost it's a lot of other natural sources.
