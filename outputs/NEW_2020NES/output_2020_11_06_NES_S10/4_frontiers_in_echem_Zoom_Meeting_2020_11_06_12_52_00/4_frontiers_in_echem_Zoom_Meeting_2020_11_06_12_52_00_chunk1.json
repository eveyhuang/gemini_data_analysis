That was always the Well, it turns out that we're almost on the cusp of doing that. And the issues now becoming getting over the cusp is not a matter of incentives anymore. There's a problem that's happening inside that those those devices that is not letting us necessarily zip that cusp. So is that really not the case for these reactions of transformation of greenhouse gases into something that then you can use to get it out of the atmosphere? Is it just a matter of incentives? There's really",

      "transcript": "Yeah. So so we we talked about this in in the last subgroup is that you know at NREL we've done technoeconomic and life cycle assessments of different pathways for you know full air to barrel scenarios. And as you scale up CO2 electrolysis, whether you use something like Opus 12, which is a PEM electrolysis in acid or something like dioxide, which is alkaline, as you scale this up to you know more than 10 to 50,000 units of production, the major cost in both of those systems is the membranes. So the idea of the catalyst cost is not it's it's nothing. Even the bipolar plates are a small thing. Separations aren't too bad if we can do this well, but for both of them, the real limiting step is the cost of membranes and both the the base materials but then also the manufacturing at large scale. So I think that's where we can kind of you know look at which you know how did batteries get 10x cheaper in 10 years? Was it the cathodes that got cheaper? Was it a better electrolyte? I think we can learn like people have said from these other fields, how did they improve efficiency, reduce cost? Usually to material component or stability or durability. And and for electrolyzers, we I mean all the modeling points in any case whether we do this in acidic or alkaline conditions, the membranes are going to be the driver for for the cost.",

      "transcript": "Wilson, I have a question related to that, which is that how much is anticipated to go down by scale? Is it all intrinsic cost or is it things that if we subsidize and started selling a lot of it, we would get the cost down?",

      "transcript": "Right. So we used for this for for the acidic environment, we used Nafion because that's already it's a known thing that they they can print roll to roll. So for the alkaline electrolysis, people are not making that at the same scale. So we actually use the same scaling relations for you know, a Sustainion or something like that versus Nafion. So the assumption is that even if it's scale you know an alkaline membrane scales the same way as a Nafion, which it may or may not, even if it does, it's still the major cost driver at I think up to 10 to 50,000 units of production. So pretty pretty high.",

That that's like now of the order of a few dollars per meter squared, right? 10 was the target set by ARPA-E IONICS and I think now there's probably I mean like most options are below below $5 per meter squared.

If if it's already very low, it's very I mean the ceiling the the floor for this is probably like a dollar per meter squared, right?

And so it's it's closer to 10 than five, but the the cost especially at these scales isn't it gets less impacted by the kind of roll-to-roll synthesis methods, so it doesn't get much more expensive to make it much bigger, but it's the base materials and the synthesis of those that is something that we find is is pretty immovable so far in in our view.",

      "transcript": "I will note though that in all and this is not to badmouth, it's going to come out much worse than I mean it, but in all these models, there's the assumption that technology and performance stays constant in a sense, right? It's a pure scale you know if you get economies of scale and that to a to a degree was a big player in the battery cost lowering because the chemistry hasn't really changed much. But that you know assumes that you cannot do better performance wise, right? There's probably a metric of dollar per unit of something. That unit of something is related to your ability to do the reaction. And that assumes that you cannot do the reaction faster or using less energy or more selectively so that you don't have to separate. And so that then takes you back to the way you're doing the reaction. And are we convinced that we cannot do better? Because I don't know that anybody I mean, you know, Wilson, you'll tell me, are these technologies that you evaluate based on cascade reactions like Jenny was proposing?",

      "transcript": "So the first question for the kind of discussion was a life cycle assessment. Now for technoeconomic assessment, we actually do a sensitivity analysis to see which operational or material parameters would lead to the biggest shift in cost. And there we see that the biggest drivers are the single pass conversion efficiency and the current density. Now the issue with that is that if you look in literature, those are things where it's kind of like whack-a-mole. If somebody can do very good current current density, they have very low single pass conversion. If they have very good single pass conversion, they have low current. So in the end, we ideally would like them both. And then that is to us a frontier is that how can you do both of those things at the same time? And that takes I don't think that that's going to be solved by a cascade reaction. I think that's going to be reactor engineering and process integration that's going to solve that, not not a cascade on a catalyst surface.",

And the reason I ask the question is in that context, would any kind of a cascade architecture have any logic to it?",

      "transcript": "So there is a single pass limit and Feng Jiao has done some work on this as well. The the limit under any conditions is about 60% because then at some conversion of of flow rates and current density, the CO2 is consumed by the electrolyte and the hydroxides. So 60% is the best you can get. Matt Kanan had a nice paper on this recently. But the way to get around that is just to do CO electrolysis because CO2 to CO is industrial. You can buy from Haldor Topsoe a skid that's you know the size of your basement and do CO2 to CO very well, very efficient, very selective, energy efficient. I mean again, you can buy it from Haldor Topsoe on their website. You can buy one off the shelf, pretty big, like a shipping container. It's pretty cool.",
