You you're thinking a lot about thermodynamics here but if you're doing a negative emissions science proposal and suggesting capture from air a lot of it's about kinetics. It's an extraction from an unbelievably dilute mixture and it's all about the kinetics and interface and liquids have a real problem there. You know how do you interface the gas of the air with a liquid and get good uptake. So be sure to I would encourage you to think about that as well when you come up with new new proposal ideas.",

I mean if you have sort of pure CO2 you know convectively transported over a porous layer you know then kinetics are probably going to be a will be your problem. If you're talking about 400 parts per million and maybe you have a blower but maybe it's just sort of natural diffusion then I I tend to think that transport is going to be your problem almost immediately right even if you know I think you know by the time you get your kinetic rate going you're going to run out of material right? So I do think that there is an interesting need for can you make and Andrew this might be what you're getting at active materials that have you know some sort of a hierarchical structure that will preferentially drive CO2 or increase the CO2 flux to the surface and can you do that through either hierarchical structure or maybe some CO2-philic polymers or something like that that can kind of continue to drive the thing in there as opposed to just relying on simple diffusive transport.",

Well controversial and there's some questions there on the mechanism but that type of concept where you're concentrating and then passing it through a membrane or whatever it might be is kind of interesting to me.",
