And so if you do like biomass conversions like glycerol or hydrofuran, HMF oxidation, does that fall under negative emissions or is that seen by funders as more because it's driving the economic viability of those processes? Or is that just seen more as, you know, it's not really mitigation, is that just seen more as some end product of conversion?",

The slide contains bullet points under the headings \"Negative Emission\", \"Mitigation Emission\", \"Hybridization of systems\", and \"System Considerations\". The cursor moves to highlight the terms \"Negative Emission\" and \"Mitigation Emission\" as the speaker mentions them.",
