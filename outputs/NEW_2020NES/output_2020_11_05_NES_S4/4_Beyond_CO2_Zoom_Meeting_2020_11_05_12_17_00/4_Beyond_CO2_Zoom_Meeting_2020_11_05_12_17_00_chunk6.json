One thing I would say is the bio might want to be its own bullet point because there are a couple of different pathways to biochemical or bioelectrocatalytic mitigation especially for things like methane. And it might be I mean we have methane activation but it might be good to distinguish because the bio routes could be used for a lot of different things not just methane. Especially this idea of generating local feedstocks for biochemical conversions.",

So if we're sticking it right on the back of flue gas does that does that count or do we really want to be thinking about what's what's viable for you know taking the dilute dilute greenhouse gases out of the air and then then converting them.",
