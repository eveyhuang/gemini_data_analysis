      "transcript": "because one of the I've from communicating with those groups and knowing their technologies a little bit, one of the issues is the starting concentration of CO2 and how that impacts the conversion efficiency to the chemicals or the fuels. In the case of Opus 12, they're in a business model that's really focused on actually just making syngas just for flexibility and being able to make different maybe it's oxalic acid that they want to make or maybe it's, you know, even you know synthetic methane for instance. But lots of flexibility based upon their approach depending on the catalyst that they're using. But one of the questions is what is the essential CO2 concentration going into your process and how does that impact the conversion efficiency which and then from a chemical engineering perspective, how does that impact the size of the reactor and then obviously the CAPEX of the system? Because how low can you go in terms of CO2 concentration as a feedstock? That that that could be a tunable parameter that could could impact costs and I don't know if you guys have given any thought to that.",

      "transcript": "I think that would that would largely be dependent that would change the mass transport of your system which would then like limit the current that you could run this at which would then yeah limit the rate at which you could produce something. And so but obviously there's you know there's probably some like optimal trade-off between the need the energy requirements to concentrate and so balancing the energy energy to concentrate requirements and the basically the mass transport requirements would be something that I'm sure they've that that would be interesting to see that analysis but my guess is there's an optimum.",

      "transcript": "So that's a a wonderful way to work together because so often these are two decoupled processes where the capture, you know, is done here and you have a capture technology and you just assume you've got to get to high purity CO2 to get it into a liquid phase for trucking or or pipeline transport or even feedstock but it's like imagine if you could get away with 40% CO2 concentration and nitrogen. Like how does that impact the conversion efficiency of your process, you know, whether it's probably not having to do with the actual reaction kinetics but more the diffusion kinetics like what you're saying Marta. But I think that that, you know, we often work in our silos and what we're trying to do here is like break those walls down and and get us working, you know, across those sectors.",

      "transcript": "But concentration and purity could be decoupled, right? I mean I think like having I mean a lot of like at least electrocatalytic systems that would reduce CO2 will definitely reduce a lot of other things as well. So that I think that is going to remain a problem.",
