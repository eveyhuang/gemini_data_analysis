So the bigger your operation is the more environmentally or less environmentally impactful they are and the more economical they are. So a lot of the small ones fold in the US just because they're like family farm scale whereas the really big ones actually have a shot at price parity. And I think one of the points that someone brought up is really novel is it's they're more interesting in areas where it's really hard to produce food because you can do it either in an urban environment or in a remote location. So like in some of the more remote villages in Hawaii they've got a lot of these systems where it's just really expensive environmentally and economically to bring food to the villages.",

So synthetic aggregate and carbon storage and synthetic aggregate instead of mining sand and gravel is another mechanism and that is removal you know provided the CO2 is sourced from air. But absolutely right the only way to get negative fuel is if you gasify biomass waste to hydrogen and in that process actually dedicatedly you know dedicate the CO2 that you separate to storage so that you're producing then negative hydrogen. And then if the CO2 is sourced from direct air capture you're right like forget about the hydrogen for a second that's at best circular. You know because you're putting the CO2 into the chemical forget about the energy flows and the material flows and the carbon intensity just assume they're neutral you burn the fuel and the CO2 goes back into the atmosphere so it's at best circular right or neutral. But if your hydrogen source comes with a negative footprint and the only way to do that is through BECS or by you know to get the hydrogen from a biomass waste coupled to carbon capture is the only way to achieve negative fuels.",

The only way to actually be negative is to pull the carbon out of the atmosphere and remove it not put it back. So if the hydrogen is sourced from biomass waste and the carbon associated with that hydrogen in that pyrolysis process is stored which many wouldn't want to do like the companies today are like why would I do that I'm making a syngas I'm making a fuel I'm making a biofuel. But in if you would like to achieve a carbon negative fuel that is really the only pathway to doing it. Everything else is really just carbon neutral at best. So it's tricky but it does have the co-benefit of not depending on crude oil which we've talked about.",
