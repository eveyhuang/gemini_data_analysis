      "transcript": "Okay I do have a project currently funded by DOE work on formic acid. The thought there is not really target the the chemical industry side. Because the chemical industry if you look at the market for formic acid it's really small okay. The market price is pretty high but the market size is too small. It's not even close to the CO2 size not orders of magnitude away. So if you think of formic acid coupling with the one you just mentioned a formic acid fuel cell we think formic acid as a fuel rather than a chemical. So there's a significant difference here. We think this as a waste for energy storage rather than for chemical production. Then you will get to a much larger scale. I think that's the way to go. To store energy in the chemical bonds with some some kind of chemicals like formic acid is relatively easy to store rather than think about hydrogen has this headache you know storage is always a challenge there or transportation is always a challenge there. I think formic acid could be a unique one to play an important role for chemical for energy storage.",

There's a wealth of literature on organic synthesis where you can think of CO2 as a feedstock for carboxylation reactions of anything to produce anything from specialty chemicals to pharmaceutical ingredients and there's a mix of pathways to be able to do that either using like any synthetic organic chemistry or or photoredox pathways where you have these nice organic or inorganic photoredox catalysts that either in their excited states or in some sort of anion radical states can reduce CO2 and and help carboxylate things.",
