      "transcript": "that are not necessarily energetically favorable. And the question is how can we implement multiple drivers for separation in terms of topics for basic science along the separations is can we combine multiple drivers thermal and electrical to improve that selectivity, improve that separation efficiency for I think that the previous speaker mentioned the challenges of beyond CO2, how can we separate additional emission products and that's going to be I think another challenge beyond just CO2 capture. How these lower concentration gases that exist in the air. And so I don't know if there's technologies out there I'm not as familiar with them but that's something that is interesting. How can you be selective to those things? How can you control interfaces and I don't know beyond more dynamic approaches rather than just either thermally driven processes.",

That paper just blew my mind a little bit I have to say. And so what we started thinking about is how we can control the electrochemical generation of just a nucleophile right because that's all you need. Carbon dioxide to us is like the world's the world's worst electrophile if you think about it right? And so if you can electrochemically generate a nucleophile from a compound that you can then break down from either introduction of an electron into an anti-bonding orbital you know there's just you know things like N-heterocyclic carbenes you know you can generate from simple imidazoliums that's a well-known reaction studied for for eons and you know just kind of trying to map out some space in that in that realm for us would be very interesting. So that's that's an idea an N-heterocyclic carbene nucleophile but I mean you can literally think about any other nucleophile or any other quinoid type compound you know it doesn't necessarily have to be a quinone per se it could be an enolate it could be you know just think of a nucleophile and it probably binds CO2 if it's strong enough.",

But yeah those are those are interesting basic science questions I think that are are important to probe if we're going to get to something energetically favorable for direct air capture especially not at direct like flue gas versus direct air capture. And that might be another question to discuss is what is the value proposition of direct air capture versus point of source and whether that's something that I've been reading about in terms of what is economically feasible now versus in the future.",

      "speaker": "Jennifer Wilcox",
      "timestamp": "05:42-07:07",
      "transcript": "Another piece that I would urge you all to think about too is the fact that CO2 is mixed with other gases whether it's from the atmosphere or an exhaust stream and in the amount for instance with oxygen and its interactions with quinones and how that interferes with CO2 reactivity and the fact that in an exhaust stream it's reducing right so in the exhaust stream you have a lot less oxygen than you do in the atmosphere. And so just thinking about those different conditions I think is important. And that when we separate CO2 it's not a separation from CO2 and nitrogen rarely. I don't know of a situation where it looks like that. So I I think it is also important to just think about as Kelsey you just mentioned not just the different concentration of CO2 that you're separating from that initial purity of CO2 but also what are the other gases that you have to kind of fight against you know when you think of selective CO2 chemistry. Maybe we can hear from somebody who hasn't spoken yet what you might have jotted down at the beginning.",

But I don't know just to throw it out there to see if anybody else has kind of thought about this or if you have any expertise that might work for capturing CO2 from seawater instead of the air.",

One is land use so like CO2 like direct air capture is going to take up a lot of space if we're doing it at you know gigaton scale so one thought is we could do this offshore to kind of free up some more space. A couple other things it also helps with ocean acidification so if you're removing CO2 it also helps the pH which can be really helpful for certain marine environments. And then just from like I'm an engineer so from that perspective if you're dealing with like a really dense working fluid instead of the air it could also have some advantages.",

It's basically I mean it's an equilibrium with the air above it so it's similar in terms of like PPM or but then when you look at like density per unit volume it's a little different but speciation is the bigger one so like most CO2 is actually not carbon dioxide when it's in the ocean it's all it's in the form of ions so it's like bicarbonate so HCO3 minus or carbonate so CO3 2 minus and then only a small percent like less than 1% of it is actually gaseous CO2 in that mixture.
