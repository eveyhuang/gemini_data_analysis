So I don't know I've been trying to... which is maybe stupid but it's like there are ways to do it I think if you use the right solvents and stuff to drive you know CO2 gas out of there but um yeah.",

I guess in my head it's like we're using sodium hydroxide so it's similar to carbon engineering where they use the sodium hydroxide regeneration process and then probably store the CO2 afterwards. I think it makes a lot of sense just because you're like if you're offshore you could potentially couple it with nice you know CO2 storage sites that are also offshore and just do it like an offshore rig basically where you're taking the CO2 and then storing it underground on site. But I don't know I'm open to suggestions if there are some interesting you know ways to store CO2 in the ocean besides that.",

So if you remove it and you know you're helping with the pH how long does it take for the CO2 in the air above that ocean water to come back into the ocean? Which I don't know the answer to that either and it's it would be an interesting question to look into.",

      "transcript": "Yeah. As far as I read I think at neutral pH or close to neutral pH the CO2 water equilibration is pretty slow. That's much slower than the CO2 and base alkaline solution equilibration. So I think there are some studies from the geological field studying how to catalyze or accelerate the CO2 interaction with water and how that affects the local marine environment things like that. So maybe that kind of knowledge can be really helpful we can look at maybe bio-inspired catalysts that can really help the CO2 and water exchange and make it into carbonate things like that.",

I mean so we have looked at one bio-inspired catalyst for this which is a carbonic anhydrase or it's I guess it's an enzyme but it's basically like what's in your blood to facilitate CO2 removal. So that's something that we're looking at but there's I'm sure there's other options too for that.",

      "transcript": "Has anybody thought about the energetics of CO2 binding? So when you look at the most successful molecules or materials out there they have strong enthalpically driven binding because of course absorption is disfavored from an entropic perspective. But of course if you're going to swing it off you've got to you've got to repay that that enthalpy penalty. So are there strategies one could employ to design more physisorbing sites that would still absorb CO2 selectively? And the nice thing about some of the inorganic or hybrid materials like MOFs is you imagine that your toolbox is huge for the types of sites that you could potentially design. So could you design a very high density of more weakly binding sites and still grab enough CO2 at these ultra dilute conditions without having to repay that massive enthalpy penalty that all these strong chemisorbing materials pay?",
