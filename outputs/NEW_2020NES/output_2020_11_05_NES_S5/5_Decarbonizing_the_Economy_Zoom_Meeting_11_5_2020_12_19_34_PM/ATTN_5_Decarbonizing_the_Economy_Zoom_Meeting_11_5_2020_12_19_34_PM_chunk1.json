      "transcript": "There's some evidence that folks aren't so eager to jump industries even when there's opportunities to transition from carbon-rich industries to renewable energy industries and so I think we should be careful about the assumption that just because we try to stand up new industries for carbon removal or renewable energy that folks are going to be on board and wanting to do that. I think it'll require a fair amount of incentives, you know removing incentives and subsidies from fossil fuels and potentially standing them up on zero carbon or negative carbon industries to help that transition.",

And at least in the scientific circles that I work in I meet up with a lot of resistance to even seriously talking about many of the fascinating and important and inevitably necessary technologies and science that we're talking about. I'm not sure that that's something we want to focus on here but it's just something that I find to be an obstacle in the circles that I work in.",

You know it's not that we start with the perfect solution but we start with some of our biggest industries and get them on board to work on their pathways and then sway public opinion.",

      "transcript": "Yeah and this is like literally the fodder for our work. I think something that Peter said really resonated for me which is that the idea of like sort of the the social dimensions of this work and I know that a lot of us here would maybe consider ourselves to be more on the technical expert side and I think what we really need is to be working with social scientists who are really thinking about the societal sort of like how society perceives new technology or new approaches how they gain traction how those perceptions shift over time and like really needing to work with social scientists to formulate our research questions to formulate our research approaches and make sure that the work that we're doing is really grounded in the social dimensions of carbon removal and climate mitigation. So and I think from an and that includes economists that includes folks that are thinking about technology deployment that includes policy makers and folks that work in the policy space more generally. So that's kind of like where I'm landing now that we can't really decarbonize the economy without engaging deeply and meaningfully with the social sciences.",
