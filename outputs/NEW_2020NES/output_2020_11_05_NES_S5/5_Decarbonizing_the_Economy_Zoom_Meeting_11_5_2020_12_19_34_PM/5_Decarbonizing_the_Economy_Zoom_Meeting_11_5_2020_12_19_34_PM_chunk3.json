I think one of one question that could be asked is when we look at the life cycle, I mean there are so many people with all kinds of different angles to this problem and I think that's the strength here, that's what makes this group interesting. And I think one possible question that we could try to elucidate is what is actually the better way, mitigate or capture. That's that is one possibility that I see that we could that we could look at. Um but we could also look at and that's based on what Rafael said is we could look at how does when we when we use our technologies that the people are developing in this group, I think a lot of what we are doing at least on my side is technology readiness zero. So what we could look at is like if we go for a really ambitious goal, how would the world look like? We could actually use life cycle techniques and integrate kind of the technologies, the really advanced technologies that we are working on that are probably 50 years out, how would the world look like?",

Solar and wind prices were much more than any other source of electricity. Transportation, there was no way electric cars were anywhere near price parity, right. So what changed was a huge level of investment to drive those costs down and huge volume, right. So things that we put as hard in the right category, is it really fundamentally hard or is it just hard because we don't have enough investment into finding other ways to make them, you know, move them to this category.",

Um I'll just maybe like add a little bit to that because we're using the term offset a whole lot here, which has a very specific meaning and a specific impact on the atmospheric concentrations of CO2. But for grazing, like the other thing we have to consider is what happens if we take land out of grazing production in places like the US, where is that land going to essentially be put into production? And you know a lot of people talk about permanence and additionality and leakage and this is a really important aspect of leakage. So if we take land out of grazing production in the US but there's a lot of deforestation and grazing that happens in the Amazon, like the carbon outcomes of that are much worse than keeping land under grazing in the US. So just considering leakage is a really important piece of how we have this conversation.",

It's just to offer them a solution and the solution could be yes, soil, great. Okay, I'm just going to send out open my mouth. But what about putting hoods, right? So they can suck air and at the same time they are going to suck CO2 and methane and then they can sell this one as a biogas. This could be a solution. I mean this was done in my small village with some cows around, you know, there was always also bad smell but they realized okay what about if we can make biogas with this one. So you can make also money, you know, not only from the cows but also from buying, you know, for selling biogas. And with the biogas you can also just a little bit recirculate in order to make energy in order that you have the hoods that is working, right? So it's more like alternatives that can can sound crazy but at the end of the day they are not so crazy. This was my idea on the cows and proteins.",

            "transcript": "So Roger and Simona and I think going back to some of the things that Rafael talked about, I think this is a space which is ripe for hybrid technologies. I mean often times when we talk about negative emission technologies, we have those six or seven technologies in mind which are, you know, BECCS or direct air capture or just enhanced weathering and they're very discrete and there are very discrete groups of people who actually work on these very discrete set of technologies. But the fact of the matter is that there are a lot of co-benefits and co-gen and I would say synergies that can be obtained by coupling some of these. So for example, if we can come up with pathways for direct air capture in soils, there's a lot that we can learn from the fluid particle interactions, from the mineral and the fluid interactions by just studying engineered weathering and applying some of those concepts for direct air capture in soils through weathering for example. There could be synergies in the way we use biochar, right? I mean biochar, I guess the controversy there with biochar is that you take biomass from location A and put it in location B, doesn't necessarily mean that there's been a significant carbon offset. But there could be more creative ways of using biochar so it can be used to maybe capture CO2, I don't know. So I think one way to think about this is to hybridize some of these technologies, hybridize some of these pathways to maybe get them get us to start thinking about co-benefits. That could be one way. And again in the context of biogas, if there if there are ways and again not a plug for what we're doing but if there is a way for us to remove the CO2 that is co-produced with say the methane in biogas, mineralize that and produce a carbonate at the same time, that is an unconventional way of looking at bioenergy with carbon capture and removal. So there could be pathways in which we could combine weathering with some of these more engineered pathways and vice versa. I think that if there is going to be potential investment, I would encourage perhaps some of it to go towards some of these hybrid pathways and uncovering the underlying science so that way there is a thermodynamic basis and there is a kinetic basis for these pathways going forward.",

Um you know I think the fact that we typically think about these very in a siloed perspective of this technology or that technology, that we do need to think about coupling technologies we don't traditionally see. Um you know a really broad view would be you know we talked a lot about grazing land. I've been seeing new studies actually where people are grazing sheep under solar panels. And sort of shades the crops and so you get solar production with the solar panels up really high. They had a funny side note that they couldn't use goats because the goats broke all the solar panels by climbing on them and playing. So I think there's things we don't typically think about. Um you know one of my other hats I work with farmers with our dairy manure waste problem in Wisconsin. You know and they're always looking for economic pathways. So a lot of them will anaerobically digest their manure and then they're trying to come up with co-products that they can sell that it's great if they're environmentally beneficial but I mean their focus is on the economics. But really if we bring it back to Greeshma's point, you know if we start thinking about adding some of these technologies together, I think that's where you'll see the synergistic benefits. We just have to be careful with how much energy we're consuming and where it's coming from.",
