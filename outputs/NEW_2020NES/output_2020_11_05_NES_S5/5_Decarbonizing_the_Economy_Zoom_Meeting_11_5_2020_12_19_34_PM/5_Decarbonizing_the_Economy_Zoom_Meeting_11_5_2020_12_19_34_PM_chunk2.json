So, should should there be some, should should there be some different attitude to, should should the power generation industry not be allowed to buy the carbon credits because actually or to use the negative emissions technologies because actually the steel industry probably absolutely has to have them. You know, the cement industry may well have to have them. So where for those industries who could decarbonize with existing technologies, should there be some restriction on them being able to tap into the negative emission technologies or the negative emissions rather.",

And there must be a number of other industries that that fall into that category. We probably just don't have very many of them in the UK so they don't feature very much in our analysis, but you may have them in the US. And somehow they need preferential, I think they need some kind of preferential access to the benefits of, you know, to be able to claim the negative emissions.",

So I've heard that oil industries are buying a lot of land because they want to plant trees because they find that a pretty easy thing to do. So that's where then restricting them to be able to claim carbon credits would encourage them to go more towards a technology solution rather than the easy solution.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I think I mean from the decarbonizing point of view, okay, big picture is, okay, there would be not perfect solution. Maybe there would be portfolio of solution, great. Hard, everything is hard because I think steel, cement, yes, aircraft, most of the time we refer to heavy transportation. Also, you know, heavy trucks or ship, you know, it's not just aviation. It's everything and they are working with jet fuel. Yeah, but it's always, you know, jet fuel contain always fossil fuel and they are going to as they are going to pledge, you know, to be like carbon neutral by 2020 because they are going to offset their carbon planting more tree, you know, doing giving some money also, you know, to removing carbon but this is not I think this could be a way, but another way is that yes, carbon tax, giving them some restriction and say, okay, you don't want carbon tax, okay, start to improve the efficiency of your equipment, okay? Because steel and cement are really old, above all in the USA, are really old as as industry and they are going to emit a lot. In in particular there is one device that is called the boiler and this one is going to emit the 55% of the CO2 from cement and steel. So just trying to think out of the box, we need a boiler, boiler means just for you need energy to make steam. Make energy, okay I don't want to, you know, sell my, you know, sell my research and expertise but think out the box and say, okay, invite them to use a different source of fuel instead of fossil fuel. What about hydrogen? What about ammonia? What about all these other particular or what about solar, wind? Yes, if there is the possibility, okay, we are going to do plant, I mean, I don't want to say a field of solar plant, but we can make energy in a different way, you know? Push them. I know it will be just a little bit down in the first year but doing them also a projection where they can be after five years and maybe they can pledge yes, we will be carbon neutral and then we can be we are going to offset our carbon so we can be also negative as an industry. I mean, these are just, you know, my two cents about that you need energy somehow and we have also to think about the energy is coming from carbon, you know, it's always coming from somewhere that requires also CO2 emissions. And negative emission is part of the game, is not the main, it could be the main role but it's just the part of the game. Yes, social, politics, everything, they have to play all the part and we are there just to say, hey, why you don't do this one, why you don't do this one? And for the long project, you can gain, you're not losing money, you know? Because we know, I mean, all the companies think first to gain money.",

So for example, I can tell you what my dream is. My dream is to prove that these minerals that I put in the soil also help to improve the efficiency of fertilizers because one of the things I realized is that fertilizers like urea have a huge CO2 footprint. So if a farmer can have a 50% better efficiency on their fertilizer, I've already offset a lot of CO2 emissions from the fertilizer production. So there's always these sort of unintended benefits that maybe we don't even realize at first. So when I started working on on on this, it wasn't an idea that I thought of. Then I started looking at, oh my minerals are making plants grow better, they're making the soil healthier. Oh, so farmers can use less fertilizer.",
