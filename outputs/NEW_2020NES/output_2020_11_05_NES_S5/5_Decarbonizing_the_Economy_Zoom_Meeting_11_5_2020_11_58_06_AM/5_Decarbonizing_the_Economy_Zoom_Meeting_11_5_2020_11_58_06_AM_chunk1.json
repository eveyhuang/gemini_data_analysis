So I think that all of your opinions during the course of this will be very welcome in how we can most well make use of the 12 of our next little more than an hour, 75 minutes. So discussion is going to be a really important part of that and I think a good way to start off a discussion is just to let everyone know who we are and I'll start this off and then I'll call out people to take their next introduction. Really just a sentence or two about who you are and what really might be interesting to this group in terms of how to best engage you in a conversation. I am the chief scientist of the energy program at Lawrence Livermore National Lab, which is one of the US big federal labs and the special part about my role is that we have a big program in negative emissions, trying to understand what they are and to do technology development. So I spend probably 80% of my job on thinking about negative emissions and what they are. Next we'll go to Marcel.",

Affiliation is with chemical and civil and environmental engineering departments at Cornell, also affiliated with chemical and biological engineering. Trained as a chemical engineer but look at processes that are both related to above ground processes and pathways as well as in subsurface environments. I'm particularly interested in the next generation of energy and resource conversion pathways, processes and systems. I think there's a lot of innovation that needs to be harnessed and developed all the way from the molecular scale to implementation as well as innovation on the social side of things in order to make sure that there's acceptance. So I'm interested across the entire scale of things in the context of this workshop.",
