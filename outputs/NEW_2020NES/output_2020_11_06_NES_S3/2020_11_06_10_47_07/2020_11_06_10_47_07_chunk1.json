      "transcript": "kind of stuck there. And then the TiO2 works well because it it sort of almost poisons the surface by creating methoxy. It's kind of nice for silicon because that protects the surface from corrosion but it's the other way is you stop the photochemistry right there. But to further along the conversion to make it all the way into things like aldehyde or CO2, you sort of have to have a very high oxidative driving force and OH radical is the way to go. Actually that is the reaction pathway of the stratosphere getting rid of the methane and but it takes a long time because there's not so many radicals right there. So if you can actually create radicals to to activate the methane I think that can create the strongly bounded methoxy that can bound to the surface. So speaking of that we are looking at the iron oxide because that's a smaller band gap it absorbs the light almost in the green and the orange region. So you have lots of them in the photons in the sunlight. So that you can activate that and also the iron oxide is also having this very similar to the methane monooxygenase is a di-iron center of their certain crystal facets so you can potentially absorb that way.",

I think there's more water than methane molecules to react if we can condense it somehow. Maybe there's a pathway there. Yeah we got to look into that specifically.",

      "transcript": "Another option would be coming up with dual function materials for in situ capture and conversion for example photocatalytic is an option. Um I think no matter what source we're considering the ultra low concentration of methane is an issue and regardless of the follow-up technology we have to find a way to address that now is either by membrane or by sorbents but any any somehow separation technology that somehow you can concentrate increase this concentration I think this is this is the key challenge to tackle here before we think about the follow-up follow-up treatment. Um so I think that's one of the options would be like what we do with regards to CO2 is to come up with materials that have dual functionalities materials that have absorption functionalities as well as catalytic functionalities. Yes this is also very extremely challenging but I guess that's that might work as well.",

      "transcript": "Yeah nature nature does this pore pore figure thing so they mount the methane into the active site and then they bring in the protons and oxidize it. So um perhaps we can do this is a looping chemical looping technique it's it's two different states and they regenerate the active sites afterwards. So I guess such an absorptive methane sorry such an absorptive membrane needs to go through maybe multi-stage process of absorbing the methane and then activate it and then regenerate it because you don't you don't have a whole lot of it it's just like catalyst of a glove box so you don't regenerate every day you just regenerate once per year so that kind of thing. So once you have a big loading of your active sites but you're not going to use it up very quickly but but actually convert it later to some useful things.",

So if you're thinking of like all possible point sources the the key issue is the low concentration right and then that's pretty much driven by the fact that entropy of mixing is favorable. Now if we had to think about the most viable point source in terms of like a lowered entropic driving force it would be a low temperature region right permafrost is probably the best place where we can at least to a certain extent overcome that entropic driving force and therefore have a little more favorability towards separation of methane.",
