I know people have looked at MOFs for hydrogen storage and methane storage that's been widely studied but I was wondering if people have actually looked at MOFs for not capture but just storing CO2. So you could actually you know if you are in a remote area where you have direct air capture maybe you could try to store the CO2 ship it to a nearby location and use that captured CO2 for something else. I mean as an alternative to a pipeline. Is that something that's been explored studied? Is that something of interest or is it even feasible?",

So similar type of thing. So it certainly is viable just as MOFs are viable for storing methane and things like that. So I guess yeah if you yeah if you selectively capture CO2 from some sort of point source and then you would certainly be able to store it in the MOF and transfer it to another location. And yeah people have looked at a lot of like natural gas purification type things where you have like sour natural gas streams right so high pressure sources of CO2 and trying to make MOFs that will selectively store CO2 under high pressure conditions and that's kind of analogous to I guess what you would be thinking about if you wanted to have like a compressed CO2 storage stream so you could store like a really high density such that it was more efficient to to transport it or things like that. Um but that's certainly something that could be possible. I think yeah the parameters that you would need to optimize in a MOF for CO2 storage are basically the same as a reversible separation. Um so a lot of the MOFs that are are good for that um would similarly probably be good for um that kind of storage application.",

I don't know if it would be more cost effective than you know just pressurized cylinders or something else but certainly for like large scale storage I don't think it's scalable like if we're talking as an alternative to like pumping underground for long term I don't think it would make sense to use MOFs for that.",

So getting to that high level of purity is expensive. So if you can just try to store it in a material and then regenerate that material for a utilization purpose that might be and this is particularly in the context of distribution distributed manufacturing right?
