      "transcript": "direct photocatalysis on solid materials. I think that the photoelectrochemical routes are probably more feasible just because they're separating the actual voltage generation from the catalysis. I'm not a molecular person and so I don't want to say anything that will get me in trouble being naive really about the prospects because clearly that's already won historically. So I don't think that can be argued with. So I mean I think that I think that I think one route that we're not talking about that is photocatalytic is somebody engineering some kind of new organism that generates biomass much much more quickly.",

And as long as you're not displacing you know agriculture or other trees or whatever is going to screw up people's lives some other way. I think I think that might be the most direct photocatalytic route there is because everything else is already figured out. You just have to scale it a little bit differently. You know.",

I mean there are lots of different kinds of algae too so part of this is selecting the right sort of species and part of it is maybe adding a microbial consortia into the algal sort of mixes if you can't really like change the genetic makeup of the algae species themselves but yeah.",
