If we're going to feed algae with 100% of CO2, they're going just to die. I mean, the percentage, and it depends on the algae because there are a lot of variety of algae, but the most used, now I don't remember the Latin name, they have a range that can go from 12 to 20% of CO2. If you go higher or lower, they just die. And the problem with algae also, is not a problem, it's just like that they need a lot of land, you know? Because they have to take sun and they have to take the UV. So they have to be able, you can make stack, but they have to be able to get the X-ray from the sun, you know, photocatalytic as you said, it's coming from bio. So they need a lot of membrane area. No, membrane area, surface area, sorry.",

I think for me the biggest issue isn't land area but water, is what you need for algae is a lot of water. So it kind of sort of like limits where you can do this. Because you have to find places that have a lot of water and also a lot of sunlight. But a lot of these like really cool new vertical systems solve the land problem. And you can you can encourage flow so you can move them through a system rather than having them in a pond and have to process a pond.",

They're nice because they sort of you know can regrow and and regenerate themselves but then they do die and can sink onto your electrode and hamper sort of the the release of hydrogen or whatever product off the electrode. I would say also though that in terms of from an electrochemical standpoint, making carbon-carbon bonds is generally really challenging and copper surfaces are one of the only ones that we have that can do that well. Whereas if you're looking at organisms, they're essentially as photosynthetic organisms or chemoautotrophic organisms, essentially they have to make carbon-carbon bonds otherwise they won't survive.

But there are ways, certainly I think that that you can and it have there have been reports. It's it's just a matter of efficiency, I imagine.",

So I guess if we're trying to think about ways to make carbonates that you could then bury underground. This is not my field at all so sorry if this is a silly question but electrochemically I guess you could split water and generate hydrogen which would be high value and leave behind the hydroxide. And so you could essentially make basic water by electrolysis and then if you're bubbling CO2 through that you would make carbonates. But then it seems like you're limited in the where the salts are coming from. So I'm curious if maybe you could couple that with some sort of desalination technology.
