      "transcript": "I just wanted to quickly add that so there are thermodynamically downhill routes and there are thermodynamically uphill routes because CO2 is inherently doesn't have a lot of energy associated with it. It's the lowest carbon state, right? So if you want to take CO2 and put it in its lowest form then the most logical pathway for that, at least what is in our consciousness at this point is that of magnesium or calcium carbonate. It's an inorganic carbonate. And then if you actually want to take the CO2 and then if you want to upcycle it towards to a fuel then the intermediate there you'll need to identify it. It's typically carbon monoxide or maybe even a formate. So then the question becomes you can get to a CO, you can get to a formate but once you have that how do you get from there to your end goal which could be a fuel, a polymer or a product of some kind. And if you have a CO2 molecule and you want to get it to being in its inorganic carbonate state, what are some of the least energetically intensive pathways to get there? I think that might be one way of thinking about this challenge.",

      "transcript": "So if you're going from CO2 to we've got different routes, methanol, carbonate, carbon, what are the lowest hills you have to climb over to get there, right? And where do you find the and what methods then make sense? Is it electrocatalytic, thermocatalytic, enzymatic, molecular catalyst? You probably are going to need some sort of catalyst to reduce that activation energy barrier further. So which steps require what catalyst? So it's probably I think... Go ahead, sorry.",

So the concept of having electrochemistry to make materials, incorporating that with the theme here which is carbon negative CO2 utilization might actually be something that we could harness. So as opposed to thermochemical routes which is primarily heat intensive, if there is a way for us to get our electrons from renewable sources looking way out into the future here, that might be another way of trying to go about producing the fuels or the carbonates and carbonates typically going to construction materials or they get buried underground. That might be one way. Bio-oils is another way.",

But in previous discussions I've heard about you know, so okay, using electricity is a great place to start but once you go to CO, at least in what I've heard of in the previous discussions, then the next steps can be quite challenging or or prone to poor product selectivity and such. Right? So so if you were to get from CO2 to CO, would you then want to do something else?",
