Where is the best place to put it and what are the challenges? Some people are saying let's put it on the platform in the ocean compared to middle of nowhere or even urban system. What are the challenges, opportunities, and questions we need to ask? That might be an easier question, don't you think?",

Is a solar rooftop making huge impact compared to concentrated solar farm? What do you think? Right? There's a lot of still debate over that too. Some people argue that rooftop solar doesn't really mean much for climate change. Some studies show that. I don't know whether it's true or not, right? But it also have a big impact. Solar rooftop solar PV has a huge impact on how public accepts renewable energy, regardless of what is the overall impact on climate change. So I think it plays a different role. But what Emily talked about urban cities versus not, I mean you have to think about what is the consequences or what could be the challenge or opportunities in these areas, right?",

So of course CO2 is a molecule that's at the bottom of the thermodynamic spectrum, right? And converting it into a useful chemical means you input a certain amount of energy and that has a certain carbon cost if you will associated with it, right? So in terms of CO2 conversion to value-added chemicals, are there chemicals and or processes where you think the possibility of a net reduction in CO2 while accounting for the necessary energy input exists and what are those chemicals in your estimation?",

Like if we made all our plastic out of CO2 it might account for a couple percent of the CO2 we need to capture. So like sequestration is a big part of it as you said. I think something that people haven't thought about in this area though is so you can make valuable chemicals but you could also make chemicals that are easier to sequester than CO2 itself which we have limited capacity for. And I don't think that's really been explored at all. So can you with less energy make something that's much easier to dispose of or be sequestered for a longer period of time than CO2 itself in a supercritical state?",

So you have a nuclear power because you're on the like platform of navy. You have a huge amount of excess energy. So these are the if, right? Then you can convert CO2 to carbon, right? Pure carbon.
