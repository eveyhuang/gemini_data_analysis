      "transcript": "unless you're going to dispose it there or use it there. So these are the questions when you try to use The main question we are asked in this session is how your new technology development or new materials would interact with earth system basically. Would you're changing many knobs at the same time by introducing new technology. How would it impact? Would it impact? Would it be a big deal or is not a big deal? What should we monitor even? I guess those are the questions. And province uh question and I think to me is the answer is depends, right? Do you need to transfer it for a long time versus short distance or what, right? One of the reasons people like converting CO2 to high energy density hydrocarbon is we already know how to move hydrocarbon all over the all over the globe without losing energy density too much. It's just so dense that you can move it far. But biomass, you don't want to transfer more than 200 miles because it start to make no sense in terms of carbon emission. You're driving your low energy density biomass with high energy density fuel. They start to make no sense, right? So these are the questions you have to ask when you put your deck or conversion systems, how you going to get to next step.",

So there are already some systems that might be could be implemented in urban areas, other that fit better in open space. So like desert or in the ocean. So are there already some promising options?",

      "transcript": "Yeah, I think there is a session on direct air capture throughout today and tomorrow. So I'm sure some of you may get involved in the other direct air capture session as well. I think there are a number of companies already developed how to move air around effectively. I think the challenge now is in material side and then integration to either storage or conversion. Because the capture material development is quite different. So let's think about CO2 deck materials compared to point source capture. What's in air versus flue gas? What's the major difference? Flue gas is mostly CO2 and nitrogen. So when you say CO2 capture is the separating CO2 out of nitrogen stream. Direct air capture, what's in air? We do have nitrogen, but what else do we have?",

      "transcript": "Exactly. And those are big challenge for any materials. Because the oxidative thermal or photo degradation will be one of the big challenges for direct air capture depending on how you do it. So although there's a lot of similarity, you should learn from the chemistry we learned in point source capture, but you should also think about what are the other potential challenges or opportunities for deck materials. That's kind of new. So that's why there was a new call for from Department of Energy on deck materials and it just got awarded this year over the summer.",
