Are any of them near the scale of what you'd expect to see like if they were to be widely implemented? In which case like monitoring is not even possible.",

Because the scale up requires a lot more bigger scale demonstration, but this is scale out means that copy paste, copy paste. So that although economic scale may not be as good, but you'll get there faster. So very different approach compared to power plants.",

How to stitch them together, very important. And how to capture CO2 and deliver to the surface of catalyst so that you can do reactive separation, huge research area. And I'm sure that you're going to be talking about it tomorrow for sure. Well thanks for joining the session.",
