      "transcript": "And it's also I think Alissa based on my reading I think a lot of the chemistry so for example if you look at CO2 hydrogenation to something like methanol you need high pressures being at sub-atmospheric pressures really hurts you in terms of equilibrium conversions. So there needs to be a significant energy input in the form of pressure to hydrogenate CO2 to something like methanol right and you need a source of hydrogen. So those are those are the additional challenges. I'm afraid I'm only pointing out the challenges and not the solutions but I guess",

      "transcript": "No no no this is good because if we already have solutions we're not going to have this session it's okay. Praveen has very good points because if you want to make any chemicals and materials and fuels you need hydrogen because CO2 only have carbon and oxygen and where that hydrogen coming from make a huge difference in the overall sustainability of technology. And people talk about four different colors now right? Black gray green blue hydrogen. And depending on which color you choose it'll be totally different. And another thing is if you're putting that middle of nowhere not only you need to have CO2 conversion reactor but you need to also have a hydrogen production reactor right there because you cannot transfer your hydrogen all the way out to ocean or somewhere else. So that's another challenge you have to think about if you want to do conversion to chemicals and fuels other than carbon you're okay right because you don't need hydrogen.",

      "transcript": "Yeah one thing to add to that is I mean there is a field of seawater capture pulling the carbonate out of seawater and capturing it that way. And one advantage of that is you can couple it to hydrogen production pretty easily. You can do electrolysis I mean there's challenges of doing seawater electrolysis but it's possible and you could directly couple that to carbon capture so you have your hydrogen and CO2 produced at the same place.",
