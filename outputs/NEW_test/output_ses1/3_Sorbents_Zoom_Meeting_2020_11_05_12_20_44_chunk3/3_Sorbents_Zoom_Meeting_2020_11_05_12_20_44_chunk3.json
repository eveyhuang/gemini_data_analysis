I mean I know you can do this for higher CO2 streams as a way to sort of just increase it passively on this side but is is there anything that's good enough to do that for air or is this ridiculous?",

So I know I I saw a paper you know they they they talked about the direct carbon dioxide reduction based on two steps. The first step is to let the air pass through the membrane and then after that just reduce the highly concentrated CO2. So I think it's it's not a ridiculous idea at all.",

And if your concentration on the air side is 410 ppm it's really tough. That's traditionally why we use membranes for high pressure gas mixture separations and absorptive type separations for really low pressure mixtures. So along those lines though there may be other ways of thinking about using membranes. I mean I I think the objective here is to think about some some really crazy new directions so I I don't want to shut down that I'm not saying that I'm just saying what traditional membrane problems would be.",

So many of us in this room work on CO2 reduction. So you know one of the things that we've thought about is instead of reducing CO2 let's reduce the it would be an alkyl carbonate or a carbamate right these are the products of CO2 capture with amines and hydroxides or alkoxides respectively. And if we could just directly reduce it from there that's a solution. And I would argue that some of the CO2 reduction alkaline cells basically do that right because you're probably not reducing directly CO2 but you're reducing bicarbonate or carbonate at those pHs. And so I think that is an interesting approach and so sort of just re-shifting our thinking about CO2 reduction to reducing bound CO2 to some of these capture agents directly. And then related to that what I realized there's no geochemist in the room but I know that in sequestration right there's certain minerals that are very this is my limited knowledge that are stable to bury underground. And so can we electrochemically generate the precursor to these minerals to then directly synthesize them capture and then just bury that and so those are just some of my thoughts is that maybe we don't want to regenerate we just want to make the product directly from the CO2 that's captured.",

But then it then you have a solid and then it depends on what you want to use it for so maybe some sort of building material perhaps that you know then the application changes entirely. But for example carbon engineering was mentioned and they they basically do this process where they have you know CO2 react with hydroxide and then they precipitate the or precipitate a solid with calcium carbonate and then heat up the calcium carbonate to release the CO2. But perhaps you could go to some other solid product you know not solid calcium carbonate but solid something else which is which is potentially more useful than calcium carbonate. But that's that's a potentially interesting direction. Because one of the things I always thought well with some with some of the mineralization stuff is that okay you make a you take the CO2 out and now it's a solid that you can easily dispose of but can you make a solid that's you know as useful if not more than some of the traditional products of CO2 reduction electro reduction. That's an open question.",

It's pretty easy to make cement other ways so there's some question as to sort of you know what kind of cost numbers you need to hit but it it that's a possibility right?",

            "transcript": "I know I know I've been I've been inspired it's just a lot of great conversation. So I guess two two main topics. One David just touched on on basically CO2 uh uh conversion or or capture into solids is something that we we somewhat started doing in our lab. I'm not sure if oxalates are any more useful than uh uh uh carbonates but but it's something that has been uh pursued in the literature about 20 to 30 years ago and and uh and it's and it actually could uh could it's actually doable uh basically doing CO2 electrochemical conversion of CO2 to oxalates which is a solid. Uh and then another another point the solid state chemist in me and immediately starts thinking about well if I wanted to give a surface to Phil or to Jenny so they could do their reactions what would it be and I'm and I'm I guess thinking whether or not uh uh if there's an opportunity here for nitride based uh porous or nitride based moths or nitride based uh uh uh types of materials that perhaps uh give us the opportunity to create that amine that we've been talking about. I mean there's been some success I'm not sure if we're all convinced of of uh of the success of doing nitrogen reduction using uh nitride based materials and and and then that sort of leads me to perhaps a a super off idea of of of how about if we could we know that flue gas has a lot of uh uh a lot of nitrogen in there and very little CO2. So who knows if we could like you know have a double whammy here where we do we basically do CO2 recovery of flue gas on the nitride uh surface that will take the majority of the nitrogen of the flue gas and convert it",
