Is this is this work? Is I mean, I know you can do this for higher CO2 streams as a way to sort of just increase it passively on this side, but is is there anything that's good enough to do that for air? Or is this ridiculous?",

So, uh, uh, I know I I saw a paper, you know, they they they talked about the direct uh carbon dioxide reduction based on two steps. The first step is to let the air pass through the membrane and then after that just reduce the highly concentrated CO2. So I think it's it's not a ridiculous idea at all.",

And if your concentration on the air side is 410 ppm. Yeah, that's what I'm worried about. Yeah. It's it's really tough. Uh, it's traditionally why we use membranes for high pressure gas mixture separations and absorptive type separations for really low pressure mixtures. Um, so along those lines though, I mean, there may be other ways of thinking about using membranes. Um, I mean, I I think the objective here is to think about some some really crazy new directions. So I I don't want to shut down that uh, um, I'm not saying that I'm just saying what traditional membrane problems would do.",

      "transcript": "Jimmy, I wanted to add something that was on my list of things that I was thinking about um during our quiet time and that was uh, do we have to release it in all cases? Right. So many of us in this room, um, work on CO2 reduction. So, you know, one of the things that we've thought about is instead of reducing CO2, let's reduce the uh, it would be um, an alkyl carbonate or carbamate, right? These are the products of CO2 capture with amines and and hydroxides or um, alkoxides respectively. And if we could just directly reduce it from there, uh, that's a solution. And um, I I would argue that some of the CO2 reduction alkaline cells basically do that, right? Because you're probably not reducing directly CO2, but you're reducing bicarbonate or carbonate um at those pHs. And so I think that is an interesting approach and so sort of just reshifting our thinking about CO2 reduction to reducing um, bound CO2 to some of these capture agents um directly. And then related to that, what I realize there's no geochemist in the room, but I know that in sequestration, right? There's certain minerals that are very, this is my limited knowledge, that are stable to bury underground. Um, and so can we electrochemically generate um, the precursor to these minerals, um, to to then directly synthesize them, uh, capture and then just bury that and uh, so those are just some of my thoughts is that maybe we don't want to regenerate, we just want to make the product um directly from the CO2 that's captured.",

And is there any, uh, and I this is really a question to the room, is there any interest in selectively separating the carbonate rather than, you know, you're just doing a simple pH swing somehow electrochemically or chemically, and then can you, uh, would it be useful to separate the carbonate selectively and then, um, use that.",

      "transcript": "But then it then you have a solid and um, then it depends on what you want to use it for. So, you know, maybe some sort of building material perhaps that, you know, then the application changes entirely. Um, but for example, carbon engineering was mentioned and and they they basically do this process where they have, you know, CO2 react with hydroxide and then they precipitate the solid with calcium carbonate or precipitate calcium carbonate and then heat up the calcium carbonate to release the CO2. But perhaps you could go to some other solid product, you know, not solid calcium carbonate, but solid something else. Um, which is which is potentially more useful than calcium carbonate. Um, but but that's that that's potentially interesting direction. Because one of the things I always thought, well, with uh some with some of the mineralization stuff is that, okay, you make a you take the CO2 out and now it's a solid that you can easily dispose of, but um, can you make a solid that's, you know, as useful if not more than some of the traditional uh products of CO2 reduction, electro reduction. That's open question.",
