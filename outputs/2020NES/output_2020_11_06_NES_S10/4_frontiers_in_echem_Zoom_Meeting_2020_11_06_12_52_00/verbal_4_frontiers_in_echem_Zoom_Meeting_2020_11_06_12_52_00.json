So, so we we talked about this in in the last subgroup is that, you know, at at NREL we've done technoeconomic and life cycle assessments of different pathways for, you know, full air to barrel scenarios. And as you scale up CO2 electrolysis, whether you use uh something like Opus 12, which is a PEM electrolysis in in acid or something like dioxide, which is alkaline. Um as you scale this up to, you know, more than 10 to 50,000 units of production, the major cost in both of those systems is the membranes. So the idea of, you know, the power's cost is not uh it's it's nothing, even the bipolar plates are a small thing, separations aren't too bad if we can do this well. But for both of them, the real limiting step is the cost of membranes and both the the base materials but then also the manufacturing at large scale. So I think that's where we can kind of, you know, look at which, you know, how did batteries get 10x cheaper in 10 years? Was it the cathodes that got cheaper? Was it the better electrolyte? I think we can learn, you know, like people have said from these other fields, how did they improve efficiency, reduce costs, usually to material components or stability or durability and and for electrolyzers, we I mean, all the modeling points in any case, whether we do this in alkaline conditions, the membranes are going to be the driver for for the cost.

Do we think a CO2 electrolyzer looks like a water electrolyzer? Um I I don't think it will, but we have to I mean I think that they're doing really important work to establish that and see and they're only making focus on making CO. So their competition is just um their competition really is you know, Haldor Topsoe. Um so can they do low temperature, which has advantages for processing integration. So it's it's really cool and I think that I mean even your your analogy with Venkat with with Tesla, you know, Tesla was not the first electric car company.
