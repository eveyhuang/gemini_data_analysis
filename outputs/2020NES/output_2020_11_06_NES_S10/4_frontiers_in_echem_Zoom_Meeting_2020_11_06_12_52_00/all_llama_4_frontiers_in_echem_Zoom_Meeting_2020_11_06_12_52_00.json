So so we we talked about this in in the last subgroup is that you know at NREL we've done technoeconomic and life cycle assessments of different pathways for you know full air to barrel scenarios. And as you scale up CO2 electrolysis, whether you use something like Opus 12, which is a PEM electrolysis in acid or something like dioxide, which is alkaline, as you scale this up to you know more than 10 to 50,000 units of production, the major cost in both of those systems is the membranes. So the idea of the catalyst cost is not it's it's nothing. Even the bipolar plates are a small thing. Separations aren't too bad if we can do this well, but for both of them, the real limiting step is the cost of membranes and both the the base materials but then also the manufacturing at large scale. So I think that's where we can kind of you know look at which you know how did batteries get 10x cheaper in 10 years? Was it the cathodes that got cheaper? Was it a better electrolyte? I think we can learn like people have said from these other fields, how did they improve efficiency, reduce cost? Usually to material component or stability or durability. And and for electrolyzers, we I mean all the modeling points in any case whether we do this in acidic or alkaline conditions, the membranes are going to be the driver for for the cost.",

It's a pure scale you know if you get economies of scale and that to a to a degree was a big player in the battery cost lowering because the chemistry hasn't really changed much. But that you know assumes that you cannot do better performance wise, right? There's probably a metric of dollar per unit of something. That unit of something is related to your ability to do the reaction. And that assumes that you cannot do the reaction faster or using less energy or more selectively so that you don't have to separate. And so that then takes you back to the way you're doing the reaction. And are we convinced that we cannot do better?

Now for technoeconomic assessment, we actually do a sensitivity analysis to see which operational or material parameters would lead to the biggest shift in cost. And there we see that the biggest drivers are the single pass conversion efficiency and the current density. Now the issue with that is that if you look in literature, those are things where it's kind of like whack-a-mole. If somebody can do very good current current density, they have very low single pass conversion. If they have very good single pass conversion, they have low current. So in the end, we ideally would like them both. And then that is to us a frontier is that how can you do both of those things at the same time? And that takes I don't think that that's going to be solved by a cascade reaction. I think that's going to be reactor engineering and process integration that's going to solve that, not not a cascade on a catalyst surface.",

So 60% is the best you can get. Matt Kanan had a nice paper on this recently. But the way to get around that is just to do CO electrolysis because CO2 to CO is industrial. You can buy from Haldor Topsoe a skid that's you know the size of your basement and do CO2 to CO very well, very efficient, very selective, energy efficient.

I I don't think it will but we have to I mean I think that they're doing really important work for us to establish that and see and they're only making focused on making CO so their competition is their competition really is you know Haldor Topsoe. So can they do low temperature which has advantages for process integration so it's it's really cool and I think that I mean even your your analogy with Venkat with with Tesla you know Tesla was not the first electric car company. They had the biggest investment they made it look nice and all those things and I think that that moment will come but we need Opus 12 and Dioxide and we need these companies to start test scale it up see what works and doesn't and then somebody will come in maybe even Elon Musk with a lot of money.",

So if you're doing CO2 even if you start with a basic electrolyte if you start to run it more than 10 or 20 milliamps it's going to become alkaline spontaneously. So it's the electrolyte consumption but then with the with the kind of transport control there are things like pressure drops that will change and it depends on if you're making CO2 to CO so a gas feedstock to a gas product the the pressure drop across your electrode will be small but if you want to make a liquid product you will create a much bigger pressure drop across your electrode and the effects down the channel will be much more significant. So it's there there's a lot of competing factors which is why I think you know CO2 electrolysis won't scale the same way that water electrolysis does. You know selectivity is not an issue for water electrolysis. Partial pressure differences across the electrodes is is managed very well and I think for for CO2 reduction it's so big you can make a gas you can make a liquid you can make lots of products they're much more sensitive to to changing their performance based on scaling relations.",
