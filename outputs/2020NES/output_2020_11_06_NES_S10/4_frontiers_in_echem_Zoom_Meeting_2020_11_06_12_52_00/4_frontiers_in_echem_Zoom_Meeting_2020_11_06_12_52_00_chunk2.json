Uh so and it's it's very Scandinavian, right? Very Danish. Uh so um uh so I I wonder if if if it's if you know, whatever, right?

We we work with them and I can't give up too many details, but they're they're their approaches they buy a PEM electrolyzer from Nel Hydrogen and they and they just retrofit it to do CO2 reduction. So it's not you know, there's catalyst engineering, there's kind of flow field stuff they can do, but it's the the basic unit of it looks like a PEM electrolyzer and I think that that's also an open question. Do we think a CO2 electrolyzer looks like a water electrolyzer? Um I I don't think it will, but we have to I mean I think that they're doing really important work to establish that and see and they're only making focus on making CO. So their competition is just um their competition really is you know, Haldor Topsoe. Um so can they do low temperature, which has advantages for processing integration. So it's it's really cool and I think that I mean even your your analogy with Venkat with with Tesla, you know, Tesla was not the first electric car company. They had the big investment, they made it look nice and all those things. I think that that moment will come, but we need Opus 12 and Dioxide and OC we need these companies to start test scale it up, see what works and doesn't and then somebody will come in maybe even Elon Musk with a lot of money.",

So they're at the they're they're right now in Alberta putting these units to these exhaust I mean they're using real exhaust streams from industrial processes to do conversions at at the stack level at really big levels. So I think the outcome of that carbon X prize, that's probably going to be the one that gets the big uh incentivization and a lot of the funding in. I can't say more about that.",

So if you're doing CO2, um even if you start with a basic electrolyte, if you start to run it more than 10 or 20 milliamps, it's going to become alkaline spontaneously. So it's the electrolyte consumption, but then with the with the kind of transport control, there are things like pressure drops that will change and it depends on if you're making CO2 to CO, so a gas feed stock to a gas product, the the pressure drop across the electrode will be small. But if you want to make a liquid product, you will create a much bigger pressure drop across your electrode and the effects down the channel will be much more significant. So it's there there's a lot of competing factors, which is why I think, you know, CO2 electrolysis won't scale the same way that water electrolysis does. You know, selectivity is not an issue for water electrolysis.",
