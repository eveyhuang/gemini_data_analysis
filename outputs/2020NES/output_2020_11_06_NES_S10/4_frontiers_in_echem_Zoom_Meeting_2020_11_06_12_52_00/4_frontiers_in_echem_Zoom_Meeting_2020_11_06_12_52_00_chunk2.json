There's only there's only one of two ways you can do it right like you don't need to take a long-term view because someone will bankroll if you know if if you know if investors don't come you know someone can say I'll just put my own money in right so I think that I think that big difference is what drives the sort of short versus long term and Topsoe being a private company has been able to do that right. You know Haldor I guess the family still owns a significant portion which allows them to make these kinds of decisions compared to the yeah compared to those that have to answer to Wall Street.",

I I don't think it will but we have to I mean I think that they're doing really important work for us to establish that and see and they're only making focused on making CO so their competition is their competition really is you know Haldor Topsoe. So can they do low temperature which has advantages for process integration so it's it's really cool and I think that I mean even your your analogy with Venkat with with Tesla you know Tesla was not the first electric car company. They had the biggest investment they made it look nice and all those things and I think that that moment will come but we need Opus 12 and Dioxide and we need these companies to start test scale it up see what works and doesn't and then somebody will come in maybe even Elon Musk with a lot of money.",

So they're at the they're they're right now in Alberta putting these units to these exhaust I mean they're using real exhaust streams from industrial processes to do conversions at at the stack level at really big levels so I think the outcome of that Carbon X Prize that's probably going to be the one that gets the big incentivization and a lot of the funding in.

So if you're doing CO2 even if you start with a basic electrolyte if you start to run it more than 10 or 20 milliamps it's going to become alkaline spontaneously. So it's the electrolyte consumption but then with the with the kind of transport control there are things like pressure drops that will change and it depends on if you're making CO2 to CO so a gas feedstock to a gas product the the pressure drop across your electrode will be small but if you want to make a liquid product you will create a much bigger pressure drop across your electrode and the effects down the channel will be much more significant. So it's there there's a lot of competing factors which is why I think you know CO2 electrolysis won't scale the same way that water electrolysis does. You know selectivity is not an issue for water electrolysis. Partial pressure differences across the electrodes is is managed very well and I think for for CO2 reduction it's so big you can make a gas you can make a liquid you can make lots of products they're much more sensitive to to changing their performance based on scaling relations.",
