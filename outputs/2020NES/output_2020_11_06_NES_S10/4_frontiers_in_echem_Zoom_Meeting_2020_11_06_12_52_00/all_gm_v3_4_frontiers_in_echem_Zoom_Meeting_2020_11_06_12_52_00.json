So so we we talked about this in in the last subgroup is that you know at NREL we've done technoeconomic and life cycle assessments of different pathways for you know full air to barrel scenarios. And as you scale up CO2 electrolysis, whether you use something like Opus 12, which is a PEM electrolysis in acid or something like dioxide, which is alkaline, as you scale this up to you know more than 10 to 50,000 units of production, the major cost in both of those systems is the membranes. So the idea of the catalyst cost is not it's it's nothing. Even the bipolar plates are a small thing. Separations aren't too bad if we can do this well, but for both of them, the real limiting step is the cost of membranes and both the the base materials but then also the manufacturing at large scale. So I think that's where we can kind of you know look at which you know how did batteries get 10x cheaper in 10 years? Was it the cathodes that got cheaper? Was it a better electrolyte? I think we can learn like people have said from these other fields, how did they improve efficiency, reduce cost? Usually to material component or stability or durability. And and for electrolyzers, we I mean all the modeling points in any case whether we do this in acidic or alkaline conditions, the membranes are going to be the driver for for the cost.",

Now the issue with that is that if you look in literature, those are things where it's kind of like whack-a-mole. If somebody can do very good current current density, they have very low single pass conversion. If they have very good single pass conversion, they have low current. So in the end, we ideally would like them both. And then that is to us a frontier is that how can you do both of those things at the same time?

You can buy from Haldor Topsoe a skid that's you know the size of your basement and do CO2 to CO very well, very efficient, very selective, energy efficient.

So it's the electrolyte consumption but then with the with the kind of transport control there are things like pressure drops that will change and it depends on if you're making CO2 to CO so a gas feedstock to a gas product the the pressure drop across your electrode will be small but if you want to make a liquid product you will create a much bigger pressure drop across your electrode and the effects down the channel will be much more significant. So it's there there's a lot of competing factors which is why I think you know CO2 electrolysis won't scale the same way that water electrolysis does. You know selectivity is not an issue for water electrolysis. Partial pressure differences across the electrodes is is managed very well and I think for for CO2 reduction it's so big you can make a gas you can make a liquid you can make lots of products they're much more sensitive to to changing their performance based on scaling relations.",
