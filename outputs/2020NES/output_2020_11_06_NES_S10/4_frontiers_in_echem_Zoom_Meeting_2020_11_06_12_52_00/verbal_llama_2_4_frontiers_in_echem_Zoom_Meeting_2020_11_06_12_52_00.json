So so we we talked about this in in the last subgroup is that you know at NREL we've done technoeconomic and life cycle assessments of different pathways for you know full air to barrel scenarios. And as you scale up CO2 electrolysis, whether you use something like Opus 12, which is a PEM electrolysis in acid or something like dioxide, which is alkaline, as you scale this up to you know more than 10 to 50,000 units of production, the major cost in both of those systems is the membranes. So the idea of the catalyst cost is not it's it's nothing. Even the bipolar plates are a small thing. Separations aren't too bad if we can do this well, but for both of them, the real limiting step is the cost of membranes and both the the base materials but then also the manufacturing at large scale. So I think that's where we can kind of you know look at which you know how did batteries get 10x cheaper in 10 years? Was it the cathodes that got cheaper? Was it a better electrolyte? I think we can learn like people have said from these other fields, how did they improve efficiency, reduce cost? Usually to material component or stability or durability. And and for electrolyzers, we I mean all the modeling points in any case whether we do this in acidic or alkaline conditions, the membranes are going to be the driver for for the cost. ",

So the assumption is that even if it's scale you know an alkaline membrane scales the same way as a Nafion, which it may or may not, even if it does, it's still the major cost driver at I think up to 10 to 50,000 units of production.

But that you know assumes that you cannot do better performance wise, right? There's probably a metric of dollar per unit of something. That unit of something is related to your ability to do the reaction. And that assumes that you cannot do the reaction faster or using less energy or more selectively so that you don't have to separate. And so that then takes you back to the way you're doing the reaction. And are we convinced that we cannot do better?

Now the issue with that is that if you look in literature, those are things where it's kind of like whack-a-mole. If somebody can do very good current current density, they have very low single pass conversion. If they have very good single pass conversion, they have low current. So in the end, we ideally would like them both. And then that is to us a frontier is that how can you do both of those things at the same time?

So 60% is the best you can get. Matt Kanan had a nice paper on this recently. But the way to get around that is just to do CO electrolysis because CO2 to CO is industrial. You can buy from Haldor Topsoe a skid that's you know the size of your basement and do CO2 to CO very well, very efficient, very selective, energy efficient.

You know selectivity is not an issue for water electrolysis.

We could go either way with this one because I mean I would consider that a frontier for electrochemistry but it's not like our specific prompt is not as directed toward that so ",
