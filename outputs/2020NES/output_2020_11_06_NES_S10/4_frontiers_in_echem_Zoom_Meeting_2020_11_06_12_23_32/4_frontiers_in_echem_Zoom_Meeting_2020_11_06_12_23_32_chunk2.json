I think electrochemistry is very fundamental to many fields but I think the topic here really calls for our serious consideration of what electrochemistry cannot do now or in other words what other fields that we can learn from that electrochemistry can do which really boosts the outreach of electrochemistry. For example what we can learn from the heterogeneous catalysis is that these reactions happen at an elevated temperature. Can we drive the electrochemistry at elevated temperature in the gas phase or in the vapor phase? I think there are quite a few work now to show that you can do electrochemistry at above the solvent boiling point but using like a solid state electrolyte or membrane.",

Photocatalysis means you are generating reducing and oxidizing agents on the same liquid interface which means you can really do locally redox reactions. That is not available in electrochemistry not just yet. So can we learn something from what photochemistry can do and really boost the capability of electrocatalysis because because all these I think just take a very traditional field for example photocorrosion. Corrosion is all local that means there exist a locally different potentials during the corrosion sites and you could oxidize the material and reducing oxygen at the same time that builds a locally galvanic cell. So can we learn something from there in terms of corrosion process and actually but in an electrocatalysis way to produce fuels or some other things some useful chemicals. So that's that's answer your question.",

            "transcript": "Yeah and to I think Jenny brings a really interesting point. Just to build on that the introducing electrical field is what really electrochemistry what is theory and hard can do. And of course we know we know little about the electrochemical double layer its formation composition its dynamics under operating conditions especially how that behaves not in a model system but also in an actual fuel cell type of or MEA type of design. So that is unknown. And and also what I think here is that many electrocatalysts now are oriented towards oxides nitrides and carbides. Of course you would like to have electrocatalyst that are conductive which means it is metallic but many of these oxides or sulfides or nitrides they're actually semiconductors or having a band gap. Of course they have defects but how do we understand the defects and electronic structure that influence the catalytic reactions. So I think that is not discussed too much we basically just treat electrocatalyst as a metal. What if we think differently? So there's so that that's also not too much discussed.",

So thermoelectrochemistry I think is something that a lot of times we go to ambient pressure ambient temperature and for obvious reasons that is ideal but in terms of system integration there's lots of sources for waste heat and so if we could take advantage of both driving forces there might be interesting science within the electrochemistry field that's dissimilar from like solid oxide fuel cells but really takes advantage of both driving mechanisms heterogeneous catalysis as well as electrocatalysis.

I think SEI solid electrolyte interphase that forms in batteries is an extraordinarily interesting accident but I think one that I think could revolutionize electrosynthesis. I think we're already seeing some of that play out but you can imagine sort of SEI being or films on top of electrode surfaces as a way to sort of allow the molecules that you want to transport inside block other things being able to tune reactivity selectivity so really thinking about sort of you know self-formed films for electrosynthesis I think that could be one where we learn a lot from the battery world in terms of how to control it how to modify it how to tune it etc.",

So I think understanding the SEI interface I mean we cannot model an electric field even at a computational level with DFT it's it's getting better now but to include explicit solvation to include potential to include transport effects I mean I think having that's to me a frontier of of something that's that's not known that would help our understanding and optimization is if we had better continuum modeling across all the scales from the surface to the bulk.",

The heterogeneous catalysis has a huge application field almost all the petrol refineries using that but as an electrochemist we got to convince them okay there's another frontier that electrochemistry can play a role but then for us the bigger question is how does that impact the practicality and and for example the industry may think okay you have you're relying on interfaces not the whole heterogeneous in a homogeneous high surface area in a homogeneous phase. So you don't build much of the porous electrode as we do I mean porous materials and phases that we do. So what is the limitation of electrochemistry and how can we really leverage what is already out there and play the electrochemistry strength.
