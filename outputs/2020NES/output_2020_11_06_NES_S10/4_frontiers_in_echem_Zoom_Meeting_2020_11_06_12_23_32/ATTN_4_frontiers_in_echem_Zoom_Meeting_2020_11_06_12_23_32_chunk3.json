      "transcript": "I don't necessarily know if there they we have a lot of meetings, but I don't know if there's really a good meeting that like if you think about the North American Catalysis Society meeting, which is the biggest meeting in the heterogeneous world, like electrocatalysis is hardly welcome there. And then, you know, ECS, you know, I think generally doesn't have too much heterogeneous catalysis. So, so I think there's not it's not clear that there's an easy bridge to be to be formed. And I think, you know, I guess, you know, in terms of communities, I think it's it's not they see it as competing, right? I mean, I think it's it's a little like batteries versus fuel cells, right? I think I think it's which is why I guess, you know, the DOE merit review now they they the two are no longer together. So, I think it's it's not obvious that there is actually any serious venue that brings a bridge between those two communities.",

      "transcript": "Yeah, but like so like with the AIChE maybe that, but that's not often research I've never found AIChE to be research focused completely. But I do I do think that I don't it's kind of like fuel cells and batteries shouldn't be competing. They have they're different applications, right? And so that should that's a, you know, hopefully a misnomer. But I do think the thermocatalysis community there's a, you know, advent of like dynamic catalysis and people are applying biases and people are looking at how ExxonMobil and all these industries are want to electrify these processes in some sort. So I don't know. I I think that that that may just be time and adoption. But I do think I do think thermocatalysis people are coming around to electrochemistry. But that's just a recent discussion point that I've had with a few.",

You know, what else is stopping us from you know, manipulating things at the levels that you would like to manipulate them? What's stopping us from doing the cascade reaction the way that you know, a cell would do, a biological cell would do? That's what cells do, right? They do cascade reactions all the time. Or you know, manipulating that those local reactions that are happening you want to see happening side by side, right? That local galvanic cell that also you know why aren't we doing that now? People just don't care enough?",

I mean, you think about people studying things like CO reduction or other downstream products, there just hasn't been as much of that. And so I think it's just I don't know if it's I don't know I don't know why that is, but you know, you think about since we've had so much trouble getting selectivity for more complex products that that would be sort of the next step is can we take some of the things that we can make cleanly and use those as feedstocks for additional reduction reactions.",

There's you know, singular people with sort of unwavering intention to disrupt a field. So I think it requires, you know, those kinds of instigators that would be able to raise obscene levels of capital, right? I mean you you need a billion dollars worth of you know, money in some form, right? Whether it's directly to R&D or or whatever, but like to to get a a thriving sort of initial ecosystem around which you can move forward. So, I think I think this field is sort of lacking that. I think yeah, I would I would say that that that that's sort of if if that happens, I think all of these things, you know, there there will then there'll be resources to do every one of these things.",

So so and and I think if you think about it, right, I think you know, this is like saying that the advantage that you know, some of the other industries have is you can sort of sell something intermediate and make money and then slowly move. Maybe this is possible here also, but the the in order to compete, right, you you need a a massive reactor which is which is when you can compete with other ways of making chemicals or fuels. So I think that's scale is maybe one one challenge that
