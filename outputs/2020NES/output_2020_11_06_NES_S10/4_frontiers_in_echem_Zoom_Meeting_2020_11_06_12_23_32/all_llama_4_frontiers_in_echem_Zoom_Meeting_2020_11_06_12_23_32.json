I think electrochemistry in terms of a discipline is one where progress has been extraordinarily slow, which is because of the fact that it's a very complex system, many interacting components, needing learning, and by learning I mean you do some experiment or you do some simulation and you want to answer some hypothesis, right? And often the ratio of the number of number of experiments or number of simulations run to test a hypothesis is very very high. And that has to do with the fact that getting high quality data is very difficult. So I think here I think there's going to be a significant advancement possible especially in this sort of very complex space of CO2 where you have many different control variables, many different design variables. So I think robotic experimentation and machine learning I think is going to fundamentally alter this this space and it's going to be a frontier that electrochemistry could be very well positioned to to spearhead because a lot of the setups that we need actually are conducive for being able to do automated experiments and may not require like human handling and so on. Like doing things with like robotic arms and so on is much harder than being able to automate like flow through type setups. So I think that that aspect I think could be one that I feel very passionately about as sort of the next frontier for electrochemistry.",

We focus a lot in our group on trying to understand the mechanism and pathways to figure out which are the key steps because oftentimes selectivity for example is determined at some common intermediate that can either react with protons or CO for example and that sort of dictates what happens in the rest of the reaction. So I think I'm very in favor of using machine learning to help us discover catalysts but I think right now in some cases we don't know what the question is if that makes sense. Like what are the key bond making breaking steps what are the key intermediates in different reaction pathways that we need to understand in order to innovate selectivity. And for the first question which is about novel materials and electrode architecture I have two thoughts on that and one is that transport for capture is important because it's dilute and that's something I didn't appreciate until I started talking to engineers. And then the other thing is that can we design architectures that can do cascades because the more I do catalyst design I realize that it's hard to optimize a single catalyst to go through several steps but if you can optimize a sequence of them and then organize them then that could be a way to get better selectivity.",

Throughput computing combined with you know machine learning or trying to understand you know what targeted properties we are looking for. For example a lot of good electrocatalysts are available right. We also want to make sure is there a route to also find cost effective materials. For example platinum is not going to be the only answer every time for instance we try to do something like this. Quite famously the system here it works well but we are not going to sequester carbon dioxide using platinum. So that's where probably machine learning or you know modeling can also work with experiment to try to optimize.

But I do I do think that I don't it's kind of like fuel cells and uh batteries shouldn't be competing. They're they're different applications, right? And so that should that's a you know, hopefully a misnomer. But I I do think the thermocatalysis community there's a you know, advent of like dynamic catalysis and people are applying biases and people are looking at how Exxon Mobile and all these industries are want to electrify these processes in some sort. So I don't know. I I think that that that may just be time and adoption. But I do think I do think thermocatalysis people are coming around to electrochemistry.

There are already existing processes that are large scale that have a very cheap feedstock and relatively efficiently and stably can make something. So it's not that we can't make it's not that we're trying to make some product that's never been made before. The problem is the competition. It is so cheap and so large scale already that our I mean it's you know I I agree with Venkat. I mean there's not a thermodynamic or fundamental scientific reason we can't do these things, but in terms of cost, I mean even if you throw a billion dollars at it, it's still going to be way cheaper for Shell or Exxon to continue what they're doing, pay their carbon tax, and they will be just fine financially, which is you know, we have to remind ourselves that business is involved in this.
