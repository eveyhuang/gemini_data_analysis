I'm I'm interested in subsurface fluid flow systems and sort of the geological record and natural analogs of subsurface systems and to some degree events in the past that are related to ocean fertilization that may have naturally occurred. So, I'm also associate for research in the College of Science at the UA and I'm also interested in learning from you all about directions that we should be thinking about heading with these exciting technologies and science. Oh, and I'm an observer, so I'm probably going to lay back and not contribute too much. I'm try to hold hold back.",

Um Carbon 180 is a non-profit that works specifically on carbon removal and we bring together policy, science, and business to essentially advocate for support and scale carbon removal across a whole portfolio of approaches from technological to nature-based. My personal research is I'm an ecosystem scientist. I think a lot about the carbon cycle, soils, agricultural systems, and climate.
