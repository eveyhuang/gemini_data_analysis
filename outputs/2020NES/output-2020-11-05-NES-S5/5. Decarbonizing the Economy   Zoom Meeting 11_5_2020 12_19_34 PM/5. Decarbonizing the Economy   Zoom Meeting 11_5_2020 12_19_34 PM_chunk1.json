But I just wanted to throw in that there are clearly social license aspects along the lines we've been talking about in terms of getting buy-in from society. But one that I've seen that I'm also concerned about uh and Julia uh articulated this well in a way I hadn't heard is the mitigation avoidance um uh protestation which actually I find to be common among scientists that we shouldn't even be thinking about these things because it is an avoidance of what we should be doing to uh reduce emissions in the first place. And at least in the scientific circles that I work in, I meet up with a lot of resistance to even seriously talking about many of the uh fascinating and important and inevitable inevitably necessary technologies and science that we're talking about. I'm not sure that that's something we want to focus on here, but it's just something that I I I find to be uh an obstacle uh in in the circles that I work in.",

And I know that a lot of us here are would maybe consider ourselves to be more on the technical expert side. And I think what we really need is to be working with social scientists who are really thinking about the societal sort of like how society perceives new technology or new approaches, how they gain traction, how those perceptions shift over time and like really needing to work with um social scientists to formulate our research questions, to formulate our research approaches and make sure that the work that we're doing is really grounded in um the social dimensions uh of carbon removal and climate mitigation. So and I think from an and that includes economists that includes folks that are thinking about technology deployment, um that includes policy makers and folks that work in the policy space more generally. So that's kind of like where I'm landing now that we can't really decarbonize the economy without engaging deeply and meaningfully with the social sciences.",

So so the farmer puts mineral in soil, they get the carbon tax. Farmers are always on the sort of wrong side of politics. So so then they they they benefit from that.

Um whether that be on a on a international or national domestic scale. Um and I think that there's value in considering instead of something like a carbon tax, motivating investors like you mentioned Grishma through through being able to make something of value out of CO2. Because if they can make something of value out of the CO2 that they're purchasing, their interest in buying that carbon is going to be independent of whether or not there's a tax associated with it from a federal level. Um and I think that kind of in this current climate in which we live where things are so polarized and can swing and up and flow in in a four-year time scale. If we're thinking about kind of elongating our interest out and kind of changing the way our economy thinks about carbon, it could be of I I I don't know. I don't think about those a lot, but there could be more value in in having something that CO2 is good for instead of just having a tax.",
