And yet I think it's now going to rotate more toward land use and things like that are critical to scientists like you who are going to be doing research for the rest of your career on these things. It's an important topic.",

Uh what are the gaps? Uh what are the gaps in existing tooling or what are the gaps in understanding and then what are some ways in which this could be fixed? I think one of the ways in which these breakouts typically uh tend to uh move is they seed uh potential proposals we would write uh among ourselves uh in clusters of entry or whatever. So the breakout sessions are usually intended to seed those kinds of ideas. So uh hopefully that sort of, you know, we identify some set of questions that maybe some teams will will pursue in the you know, as a proposal for the for this meeting and future.",

So uh so I think the initial discussions we discussed a few of the industries where there are locked in CO2 emissions. So they may need to be paired with negative emission. Um and then uh we started out by wanting to identify whether there are sectors that we can use the same process captures you are doing fair uh or you can invent new processes without emissions. So identifying that boundary which may go to the next slide and then uh we all talked about ways to accelerate the timeline uh for progress for these these ideas. Media engagement, lots of discussion there. Um and then natural solutions tend to have uh a data preference for adoption versus technological solutions. And then um there were points that on uh so I was thinking about it from an investment business perspective, quantifying strengths um and quantifying these metrics are are crucial. And then second here we discussed about um sectors that are easier, quote unquote easy uh to to decarbonize versus not. So here we put electricity production. I guess I I added transportation as my own opinion, maybe maybe people currently. Um and then some that I guess many agreed as hard is steel cement um large vehicles and and food. Um and so should it should who uses negative emissions depends on which of these two categories you fall in. Uh and then uh and sort of, you know, this term decarbonization uh there's sort of two I guess enabling platforms, solar and wind uh based electricity which can be then combined to do X where X is whatever. Um transportation, other things and then other angle is producing carbon neutral uh fuels. Uh and then uh there's sort of, you know, other I guess some of the other discussions around uh using other forms of energy. Wait. There's too much for me. Oh my god. decarbonizing themselves and then co-benefits of hybridization uh and then we talked about this sort of integrated system view which led us into this tools category which I think was a neat output where, you know, if you had these tools, you can analyze these problems much faster. Uh there's at least some consensus that there's lack of good open source tools. There are some databases could be improved. Um and verification is the challenge.",

But one could think that in some respects, negative emission technologies and science are a little bit disengaged with um the economy and industries that it is supposed to either mitigate or assist. And and maybe a question we should think about is which of these technologies is best poised to most immediately engage? And then what are the barriers to those uh to that engagement? How do we how do we move them from the bench top to to the economy?",

And that many of those are going to be in the in the small categories and the things that aren't normally thought of. And that that's certainly an important research topic of establishing criteria for why you would call things appropriate for negative emissions. And and what are those things? So we're also used to thinking about electric power and I kind of agree that electric power looks like it's handled or at least the technology is there.",

I mean, we are I know we we have a number of programs in the UK looking at at zero carbon steel making, looking at hydrogen reduction steel. I know Tata Steel are are actually supporting um quite a lot of that. Yeah. what they might do. And and I think there are some interesting opportunities as well because you get these silicate slags which you which you can then turn into carbonates and essentially use as a you know, as a a negative emission element to the process. So I think there are some interesting studies to be done in some of these hard to decarbonize industries, actually looking at all the steps of their processes and seeing what you could take out or what you could you can turn into a a zero emissions or where there might be a negative emission opportunity. Um it requires quite a lot of detailed understanding of the individual chemical processes or manufacturing processes themselves. But I liked your point about I liked your point about the the small scale emissions because in general, where we get emissions on a large scale, we have some chance of capturing them or you know, it may be it may be that the investment in finding a completely of doing it is is very worthwhile. Where you get lots of very small emitters, that can be that can be very much much harder to do with. I mean, it's much harder to do with emissions from the tailpipe of a of a car than it is from a from a power station. Of course. Actually, of course, there'll be there'll be small scale emissions from the different parts of natural environment that we aren't really able to deal with. But I certainly like the the the techno you know, the tools for techno economic. Because it's small emissions that we aren't really able to deal with.",
