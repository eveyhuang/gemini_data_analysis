Um, you want to say your name and affiliation and just a very short description of what your research interests are. Uh, for your reference, you all put videos introducing yourselves. So you have a longer version of it. And so if somebody's interested in somebody else, you also have the option of going to watch the video or, you know, separately. And so in interest of time, I ask you that you go that you brief, one liner of who you are. Um, so I am going to go in the order, just to be structured, in the order that I see people listed on the participant list. Just, you know, we don't have a physical thing, we can go around. So I think it should be easier.",
