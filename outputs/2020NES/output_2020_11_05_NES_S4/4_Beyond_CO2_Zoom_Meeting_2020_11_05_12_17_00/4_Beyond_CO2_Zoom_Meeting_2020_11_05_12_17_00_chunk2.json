Does anybody have a perspective on that from an engineering perspective?",

            "transcript": "Yeah maybe something to add about you know just irrespective of what chemistry we're going to be looking at electrochemical approaches in either replace or work in concert with thermochemical approaches. Beyond the chemistry the mode of operation I think is really important in terms of flexibility and scale. So if you look at you know this example of ammonia if you have steam methane reforming high temperature running 24/7 Haber-Bosch high temperature 24/7. One of the advantages of electrochemistry is that if even a part of that can follow the load directly or have some kind of buffer it can be a flexible way to you know use excess grid electricity to store hydrogen and then be able to feed it at different time scales and so the modes of operation for those things are not only continuous high temperature and large scale I think some of the flexibility that we gain in electrochemistry is we can scale things down which isn't always seen as an advantage but we can scale them down and flexible. So I think if we think about the way we operate these things are centralized they're really big and then we send everything away but electrochemistry can make smaller subunits that can be much more flexible. So I think in terms of the chemistry there may be certain chemistries like I would think you know making hydrogen as something that can load follow from the grid take the excess renewable electricity at a given time of the day store hydrogen use it somewhere else that may give us more advantages than just trying to do something directly electrochemically which will be hard to compete one to one with thermochemistry. So the thing I just want to add there is that you know the flexibility and the scale of electrochemistry gives us a lot of advantages when we're trying to couple different types of systems together.",

            "transcript": "Sorry. So so one thing maybe I I want to add on Wilson's comments is it's excellent point is the advantage of electrochemistry beyond CO2 and it really depend and if you think about two of the molecules we thought about nitrogen and ammonia sorry nitrogen and methane the real question is when you want to using it right as do you want to use it right at the spot or you want to and where you got those molecules. We have a lot of nitrogen in the air so maybe that's not an issue but as as today's presentation shows that methane concentration is very small in the air. So even and so the question is maybe one thing before we're discussing what kind of technology we develop for example for methane the question is on what scenario we should develop that technology and that may help later for the techno life cycle analysis too because we need to pinpoint on what scenario we want using those.",

            "transcript": "And I guess just to piggyback off that conversation I think I think it is important to think about there's two ways to think about what to make. One is the order of magnitude like potential for carbon sequestration. So if you think about that like going after something like cement and steel right is really important but can you do it can you electrify that process is unknown right. And so there's the order of magnitude approach to deciding what is worth going after but then there's the the approach of we can do something we know we can engineer something to do that task. Um and so I'm curious about this group what they think like should drive the research should we be going after things based on the order of magnitude of the potential for CO2 sequestration or should we be going more after what we can electrify within the next five years.",

I think figuring out how to do electrosynthetic transformations that are universal to wide varieties of synthetic processes is useful is very useful because you're not targeting a specific molecule but you're targeting it's methodology. It's basically organic methodology using carbon-free feedstocks and that's super important and that goes to even though the target molecule might be a small component overall you're changing how an industry approaches that conversion and so it's a big aggregate effect and I think that's really important to think about both in the scale",

And I think so one thing that I've been wondering about is that so we've talked about lots of different types of transformations here so nitrogen methane and these carbon-carbon transformations and what I've wondered about is how specific does that material need to be for a particular transformation or can we build electrodes or electrochemical systems that can do many different types of electrochemical transformations given the same electrochemical system given the same electrode basically.",

We know that everything in the chemical process industry is multiple steps and an example of where that can be relevant of just having that information is you know if you want to do CO2 conversion to syngas and make you know send syngas to a Fischer-Tropsch synthesis plant well if Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is going on at like you know 50 bar or something then you can start to question well do I want to make my syngas at atmospheric conditions then pressurize the gas and send it in which is you know several energy penalties or if you know the downstream processing is already at a high pressure well what if we do our direct electrosynthesis at directly high pressure and then you so so in that sense I think getting to that question of you know what are the ideal conditions we want for our system to to understand fundamentals and optimize mechanisms I think we do need to know more about the up and downstream processes in terms of you know what volumes do we need what again what flexibility do they have and even what conditions they run at because the integration is going to be where where I think electrochemistry will win is if we can integrate with existing processes that are already very very efficient you know can we have the same efficiency of one step without the CO2 emissions or even improve efficiency but I think the integration is going to be essential to knowing what are the conditions to optimize an individual catalyst or electrode.",

What's cool about that is it gets back to what Katie said is that that could be used for basically any enzymatic system. So if you can do that step you've you can do any enzymatic transformation from that.",
