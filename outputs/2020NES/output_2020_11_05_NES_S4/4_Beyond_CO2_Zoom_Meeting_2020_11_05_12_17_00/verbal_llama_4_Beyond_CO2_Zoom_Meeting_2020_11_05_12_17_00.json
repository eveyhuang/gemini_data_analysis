There are obvious problems with that. But we learn so much that and I'm also a little bit confused honestly and I apologize for my naivete about the proper definition of negative emission science still. Right, it reminds me a little bit of you know green chemistry before 1990 just dealt with the waste that was already being produced rather than preventing waste in the first place. So I'm not completely sure that there is a clear definition. So that's why sorry I'm just trying still to get calibrated here. But like to me right if I look at the chemical industry, if you look at fine fine chemicals right, like the higher you go up in complexity, the more waste you produce. I mean that translates to a bigger CO2 footprint as well. So you know all of a sudden we could be talking about electrochemical approaches to chiral synthesis of like building blocks or more complex molecules. So I don't you know I don't want to take the discussion in the wrong direction. I'm just confused about where our focus is. But to finally answer Martha's question, I was just talking about generating the chemical fuel for the enzyme that does a reaction we don't know how to do it properly. You spend less energy making NADH if your enzyme gives you the product you want for example. ",

But here's as a as a funder in the space I'll share my thoughts which is if you saw the chart that we see a lot that in the keynote that comes from the 2017 UNP report that's showing the projections decades out of even with a very aggressive pathway for emissions reduction right you still need this massive wedge of negative emissions of the removal of previously emitted greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere of the oceans somehow at a scale of 10 or 20 gigatons a year by mid or late century. That's what drives focuses my my attention as a funder on those specifically the negative emissions technologies that aren't getting funded and aren't getting developed that we wish we'd have been developing the core science for 10 years ago right because we can't wait till 2050 to all of a sudden just reach into the closet and pull out 10 gigaton a year scaled everything you know like we're we're behind there so that's why negative emissions for me is the focus is that by comparison the efforts to reduce our our emissions are getting more funding and more attention whether it's through the electrification of everything or all of this stuff that we're talking about it's not to say that I don't think it's important it's more just that if we don't acknowledge that actual negative emissions is the plug that's making these climate models work in 2050 and beyond and we don't have actual scalable negative emissions technologies then the climate math breaks. So it's not at all to diminish the importance of you know if there was a breakthrough in core science that was applicable to both mitigation and to negative emissions that's that's a no-brainer win-win but I'll stop here because I see the time's running out. I hope that explains it that's why funders like us are so attracted to negative emissions because those tools don't seem to be there yet and we're going to need them. ",

I guess what I'm what I'm asking is you know what what fraction of what we're putting out right now is being put into the model as the aggressive target for reducing emission versus what what you know in the most ideal future reality could could be you know accounted for by by completely cutting out emission. Because the the the reason I I wonder about the the focus of of the discussion here and and kind of the the conference as a whole is if if the question is we really need to you know negative emission is the only answer then the beyond CO2 conversation we're having here is kind of moot and we should all kind of just circle back to CO2.

But but I'll briefly answer try to answer your question to the extent I can which is you know those projections they don't have emissions flatlining they have emissions obviously going down we're somewhere in the 40-ish gigatons a year globally of CO2 and I think it's 50 if you do CO2 equivalent and include include non-CO2 greenhouse gases and you know I mean from visual memory even the the aggressive cases have you know positive emissions going down from the 40s into maybe like 10 gigatons a year or five or something that residual that you just can't you know you'll never be able to get rid of and then it's the actual negative emissions that are the offset to that at the scale of like 10 gigatons a year in 2050 or something like that depending on the model depending on the temperature.
