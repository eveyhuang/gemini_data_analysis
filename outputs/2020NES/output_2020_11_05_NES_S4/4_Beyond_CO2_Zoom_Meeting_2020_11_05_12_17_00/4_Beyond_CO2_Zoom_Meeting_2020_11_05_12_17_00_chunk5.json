            "transcript": "Yeah. Yes, sure. Well, this puts me in a scary position to be telling you all what's important here. I, and I'm sorry, I don't remember your name, but the gentleman who made the comment that it sounds like scientific progress in this area could equally, or at least in theory, could be applied to both mitigation and negative emissions. And if that's true, then that's just a win-win. So that maybe these distinctions don't really help. But here's as a funder in this space, I'll share, I'll share my thoughts, which is if you saw the chart that we see a lot that in the keynote that comes from the 2017 UNEP report that's showing, showing the projections decades out of, you know, even with a very aggressive pathway for emissions reduction, right? You still need this massive wedge of negative emissions of the removal of previously emitted greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere or the oceans somehow at a scale of 10 or 20 gigatons a year by mid or late century. That's what focuses my, my attention as a funder on those, specifically the negative emissions technologies that aren't getting funded and aren't getting developed that we wish we'd have been developing the core science for 10 years ago, right? Because we can't wait till 2050 to all of a sudden just, you know, reach into the closet and pull out 10 gigaton a year scaled, you know, everything. You know, like we're, we're behind there. So that's why negative emissions for me is the focus is that, you know, by comparison, the efforts to reduce our, our emissions are getting more funding and more attention, whether it's through, you know, the electrification of everything or, you know, all of this stuff that we're talking about. It's not to say that I don't think it's important. It's more just that if we don't, if we don't acknowledge that actual negative emissions is the plug that's making these climate models work in 2050 and beyond, and we don't have actual scalable negative emissions technologies, then, then the climate math breaks. So, um, it's not at all to diminish the importance of, you know, if there was a breakthrough in core science that was applicable to both mitigation and to negative emissions, that's, that's a no-brainer win-win. But, but I'll stop here because I see the time's running out. I hope that explains it. That's why funders like us are so attracted to negative emissions because it's, it's those tools don't seem to be there yet, and we're going to need them.",

            "transcript": "Just as a clarifying question, in the models there, they look at like realistic and aggressive levels of reduction, but, but they're not, I mean, what, what's the scenario where you could actually take emissions to near zero? Like if, you know, basically freeze where we're at right now. Like I, I guess what I'm, what I'm asking is, you know, what, what fraction of what we're putting out right now is being put into the model as the aggressive target for reducing emission versus what, what, you know, in the most ideal future reality could, could be, you know, accounted for by, by completely cutting out emissions. Because the, the reason I, I wonder about the, the focus of, of the discussion here and, and kind of the, the conference as a whole is if, if the question is we really need the, you know, negative emission is the only answer, then the beyond CO2 conversation we're having here is kind of moot, and we should all kind of just circle back to CO2.",

They have emissions obviously going down. We're somewhere in the 40-ish gigatons a year globally of CO2, and I think it's 50 if you do CO2 equivalent and include, include non-CO2 greenhouse gases. And, you know, I mean, from visual memory, even the aggressive cases have, you know, positive emissions going down from the 40s into maybe like 10 gigatons a year or five or something, that residual that you just can't, you know, you'll never be able to get rid of. And then it's the actual negative emissions that are the offset to that at the scale of 10 gigatons a year in 2050 or something like that, depending on the model, depending on the temperature.",
