            "transcript": "intermediates in general. Doesn't matter which small molecule we catalyze. So CO2 is like an obvious one, nitrogen is an obvious one. There are obvious problems with that. But we learn so much that and I'm also a little bit confused honestly and I apologize for my naivete about the proper definition of negative emission science still. Right, it reminds me a little bit of you know green chemistry before 1990 just dealt with the waste that was already being produced rather than preventing waste in the first place. So I'm not completely sure that there is a clear definition. So that's why sorry I'm just trying still to get calibrated here. But like to me right if I look at the chemical industry, if you look at fine fine chemicals right, like the higher you go up in complexity, the more waste you produce. I mean that translates to a bigger CO2 footprint as well. So you know all of a sudden we could be talking about electrochemical approaches to chiral synthesis of like building blocks or more complex molecules. So I don't you know I don't want to take the discussion in the wrong direction. I'm just confused about where our focus is. But to finally answer Martha's question, I was just talking about generating the chemical fuel for the enzyme that does a reaction we don't know how to do it properly. You spend less energy making NADH if your enzyme gives you the product you want for example.",

So what I wrote down was more along the lines of what you were mentioning is using electrochemistry more broadly as a synthetic chemistry tool, right? So you know making carbon-carbon bond formation or like doing sort of organic chemistry electrochemically. Is there an opportunity to to do that and would that be in terms of like the is that going to is that going to decrease waste make those make those reactions more efficient and more and less expensive from a CO2 sense in terms of how much energy goes into those those later stage chemical transformations.",
