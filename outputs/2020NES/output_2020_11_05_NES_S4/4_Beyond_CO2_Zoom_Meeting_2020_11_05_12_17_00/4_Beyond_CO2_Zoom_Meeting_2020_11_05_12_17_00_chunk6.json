One thing I would say is for the bio might want to be its own bullet point because there are a couple of different pathways to bio chemical or bio electro catalytic mitigation especially for things like methane. And it might be I mean we have methane activation but it might be good to distinguish because the bio routes could be used for a lot of different things not just methane. Especially the idea of generating feed local feed stocks for biochemical conversions.",

And and so I mean you're pulling it out of the air but you're really capturing it right before you you emit it. Uh and and so it that could almost be considered uh curtailing uh existing emissions rather rather than you know, really a negative emission technology. So if if we're sticking it right on the back of flue gas does that does that count or do we really want to be thinking about what's what's viable for you know, taking the dilute dilute greenhouse gases out of air uh and then then convert.",
