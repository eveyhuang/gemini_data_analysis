Um are these are the small molecules that make many organisms they eat and that they as energy source to drive the reaction. Um the question is do you want them to put in the same reactor or you want to separate those and there are different various designs about how you integrate electrochemistry with biochemistry by using some mediating molecules in between. Yeah. There are multiple routes there.",

Um I I would say it's if you really want to put a microbes on top of electrode, um it has a theoretically higher efficiency yet it does have a more demanding requirements for metabolic. You still need to tweak around the metabolism and the chemical biology inside the cell. So that's a trade off of at least from efficiency wise. The scalability is another topic. I don't think people really talk too much about that yet.",
