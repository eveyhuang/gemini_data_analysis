Because as a what people said is you can't just generating whatever they used to eat like hydrogen gas, CO. These are the small molecules that make many organisms they eat and they as an energy source to drive the reaction. The question is do you want them to put in the same reactor or you want to separate those and there are different various designs about how you integrate electrochemistry with biochemistry by using some intermediating molecules in between. Yeah. There are multiple routes there.",
