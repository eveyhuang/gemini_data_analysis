You want to say your name and affiliation and just a very short description of what your research interests are. For your reference you all put videos introducing yourselves so you have a longer version of it and so if somebody's interested in somebody else you also have the option of going to watch the video or you know connect separately. In the interest of time I ask you that you that you're brief to one liner of who you are. So I am going to go in the order just to be structured in the order that I see people listed on the participant list. Just you know I don't have a physical thing to be going around so I figured it'd be easier. So Adam would you mind starting? Holewinski.",
