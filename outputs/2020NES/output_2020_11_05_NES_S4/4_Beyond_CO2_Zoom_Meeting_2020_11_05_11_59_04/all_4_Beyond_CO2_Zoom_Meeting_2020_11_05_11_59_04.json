Because the goal of the recorder is to distill the big, more than just say everything that was said. It's important that the recorder finds the ideas that are gaining the most traction. That makes the report's job easier and also more impactful when you go to the report out, which will happen after we're done.

One of the things, especially going beyond CO2, one of the things obviously is nitrogen transformation, nitrogen to ammonia or just ammonia, sustainable ammonia synthesis in general. I think the real thing is doing that as low temperature ammonia synthesis. That could be direct electrochemical or probably more practical is to do a low temperature hydrogenation for distributed ammonia because the issue right now is when you do elevated temperatures, you have to do elevated pressures of H2 to overcome the thermodynamic barriers of increasing the temperature to go to the kinetic barriers of nitrogen nitrogen bond cleavage. So if you can do low temperature, if you can break that nitrogen nitrogen bond kinetically at lower temperatures, then you don't need as much hydrogen pumping in. You don't need the pressures of hydrogen which allows you to use electrolytic hydrogen from solar hydrogen. Or you could do direct electrochemical, although I think that's very, very hard to out compete hydrogen evolution for electrochemical ammonia.",

Actually, it's also very energy consuming and energy intensive for the current processes.

One way we thought about is actually we are doing is just feeding electricity to accelerate nitrogenase, um, which have done pretty well in MBA environment for millions of years and you get organic fertilizer out of the buck and you just feed it spray through the ground, you don't need to separate that, um, because anyway they go to the ground in a field.

I mean, this is not like a completely new idea, but the the conversion, so basically the electro catalytic generation of food for enzymes, right? So like I mean, people have tried to make efficient system for NAD+ to NADH. I mean, I know you can use hydrogen and have some work itself, but there might be much more efficient ways if you generate the food for the enzyme, the driving force electrochemically directly. And as far as I understand, there's still huge hurdles in terms of both activity and over potential associated with that. I don't know what's the food for methane oxygenases.",
