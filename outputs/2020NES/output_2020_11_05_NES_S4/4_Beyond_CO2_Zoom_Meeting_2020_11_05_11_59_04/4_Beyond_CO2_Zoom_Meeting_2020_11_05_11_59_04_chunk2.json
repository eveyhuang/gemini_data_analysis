My role here as a facilitator is mostly to listen and perhaps make sure that you all feel empowered to intervene and share your ideas, so please do. You don't have to wait for me to call on you, but I would like to hear from everybody. I'm interested in all that you have to say. As somebody who's been on your side and has been on Marta's position right now, which is to record, it's very helpful if you are able to build from each other's ideas and see if that converges. It doesn't have to converge, but think about it in that aspect as well, you know, how would you build your ideas on top of somebody else's? Because the goal of the recorder is to distill the big, more than just say everything that was said, it's important that the recorder finds the ideas that are gaining the most traction. That makes the reporter's job easier and also more impactful when you go to the report out, which will happen after we're done. So with that I'm just going to take a step to the side and see if somebody wants to get the discussion started by using some of the ideas that you wrote down.",

            "transcript": "I'm happy to start. One of the things, especially going beyond CO2, one of the things obviously is nitrogen transformation, nitrogen to ammonia or just ammonia, sustainable ammonia synthesis in general. I think the real thing is doing that as low temperature ammonia synthesis. That could be direct electrochemical, but probably more practical is to do a low temperature hydrogenation for distributed ammonia because the issue right now is when you do elevated temperatures, you have to do elevated pressures of H2 to overcome the thermodynamic barriers of increasing the temperature to go with the kinetic barrier of nitrogen-nitrogen bond cleavage. So if you can do low temperature, if you can break that nitrogen-nitrogen bond kinetically at lower temperatures, then you don't need as much hydrogen pumping in. You don't need the pressures of hydrogen which allows you to use electrolytic hydrogen from solar hydrogen. Or you could do direct electrochemical, although I think that's very very hard to outcompete hydrogen evolution for electrochemical ammonia.",

            "transcript": "Can I follow this nitrogen cycle? Yeah. So of course we see the conversion of nitrogen to ammonia very important and a very good idea. But the next step, I think the first step, formation of ammonia is very very challenging, right? And then next step, ammonia to nitrate to other chemicals cannot be overlooked. Actually it's also very energy consuming and energy intensive for the current processes. So the new processes, for example electrochemical conversion of the ammonium to nitrate is also beneficial to the whole point. And backward, the nitrate reduction, I think that's also important because for the environmental issues, right? So the current technology also use a lot of thermal treatment and separation process to reduce it. So we can also develop technology...",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I'll jump in there too and say in addition to ammonia, so we're going through the, I think we're all touching on all the different nitrogen transformations, but looking at direct nitrogen oxidation so you can skip the nitrogen to ammonia, ammonia to NOx, doing direct nitrogen oxidation has not been demonstrated from my perspective. It has been demonstrated in papers but I would say that that's still has not really been demonstrated. That would be a large energy savings instead of having to go through ammonia as an intermediate. With the question of the nitrogen also, I think that there's lots of questions on whether ammonia should be used as a fuel as well as a fertilizer. And I think that from a life cycle perspective, you're running into questions that mirror that with respect to ethanol. And so it may not be the end-all molecule. And so my main thing is talking about where we really do think ammonia should be used, kind of needs to be something that is defined in the literature. I'm hesitant to say that it's the end-all molecule for all applications, but that's starting to emerge as a topic. So I agree, nitrogen oxidation, I'm a big fan of that for sure.",

            "transcript": "So maybe I can add something. So I want to follow up with the nitrogen case. At least at this moment, the biggest part of ammonia use is fertilizers and you better go organic anyway, putting in agriculture. And as was mentioned earlier, nature anyway can do it, they just do it slower and without renewable source. One way we thought about is actually we're doing is just feeding electricity to accelerate nitrogenase, which has done pretty well in ambient environment for millions of years. And you get organic fertilizer out of the bug and you just spray it through the ground. You don't need to separate that because anyway they go to the ground in a field. Another thing I want to add on similarly is methane, which we haven't touched on yet, but nature has an enzyme to do methane too. Maybe they just need an energy source like electrochemistry to get accelerated and to fix and mitigate that. And another way you can think about organism as catalyst is they replicate themselves. So they can self, it's should be long-lasting enough.",

I mean this is not a completely new idea but the conversion, so basically the electrocatalytic generation of food for enzymes, right? So I mean people have tried to make an efficient system for NAD+ to NADH. I mean, I know you can use hydrogenase and have some work itself but there might be much more efficient ways if you generate the food for the enzyme, the driving force electrochemically directly. And as far as I understand, there's still huge hurdles in terms of, well, both activity and overpotential associated with that. I don't know what the food for methane mono-oxygenases are.",
