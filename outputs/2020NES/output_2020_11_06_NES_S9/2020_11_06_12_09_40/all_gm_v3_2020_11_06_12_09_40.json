It's the lowest carbon state, right? So if you want to take CO2 and put it in its lowest form, then the most logical pathway for that, at least what is in our consciousness at this point, is that of magnesium or calcium carbonate. It's an inorganic carbonate. And then if you actually want to take the CO2 and then if you want to upcycle it towards to a fuel, then the intermediate there, you'll need to identify it. It's typically carbon monoxide or maybe even a formate. So then the question becomes you can get to a CO, you can get to a formate, but once you have that, how do you get from there to your end goal, which could be a fuel, a polymer, or a product of some kind.

And so we can use this hydrogen to make electricity. And then on the other side of the membrane, I have most of the time I have a stream that is mainly composed by CO2. And so this CO2 can be also converted. So I can make well, not I, there are expertise that can make carbon neutral energy. So in that case we will have carbon free, carbon neutral hydrogen, you know? Because we are just going to furnish hydrogen but we are not going to release CO2 and also CO2 can recycle back in the process that if it will be electrochemical process, you know, or could be like Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and you can use for make from CO2 other ethylene or methanol or ethanol, any kind of synthetic fuel. I'm not I have no expertise what will happen after the CO2, you know?

And so what I'm trying to say is that some awareness of the market, some awareness of fit with the existing landscape, I think is important to consider in the context of particularly utilization. And another less explored route is industrial decarbonization. So there's a way for us to couple carbon negative CO2 utilization with trying to decarbonize the steel industry, cement industry. Uh that might also be another pathway. Also pathways to produce fertilizer, right? That require both nitrogen and hydrogen, right?

And so what I'm trying to say is that some awareness of the market, some awareness of fit with the existing landscape, I think is important to consider in the context of particularly utilization. And another less explored route is industrial decarbonization. So there's a way for us to couple carbon negative CO2 utilization with trying to decarbonize the steel industry, cement industry. Uh that might also be another pathway. Also pathways to produce fertilizer, right? That require both nitrogen and hydrogen, right?

I would say also though that in terms of from an electrochemical standpoint, making carbon-carbon bonds is generally really challenging and copper surfaces are one of the only ones that we have that can do that well. Whereas if you're looking at organisms, they're essentially as photosynthetic organisms or chemoautotrophic organisms, essentially they have to make carbon-carbon bonds otherwise they won't survive.

So I guess yeah if you yeah if you selectively capture CO2 from some sort of point source and then you would certainly be able to store it in the MOF and transfer it to another location. And yeah people have looked at a lot of like natural gas purification type things where you have like sour natural gas streams right so high pressure sources of CO2 and trying to make MOFs that will selectively store CO2 under high pressure conditions and that's kind of analogous to I guess what you would be thinking about if you wanted to have like a compressed CO2 storage stream so you could store like a really high density such that it was more efficient to to transport it or things like that. Um but that's certainly something that could be possible. I think yeah the parameters that you would need to optimize in a MOF for CO2 storage are basically the same as a reversible separation.
