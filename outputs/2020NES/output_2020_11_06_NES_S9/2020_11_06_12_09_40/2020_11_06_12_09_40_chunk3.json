It's the lowest carbon state, right? So if you want to take CO2 and put it in its lowest form, then the most logical pathway for that, at least what is in our consciousness at this point, is that of magnesium or calcium carbonate. It's an inorganic carbonate. And then if you actually want to take the CO2 and then if you want to upcycle it towards to a fuel, then the intermediate there, you'll need to identify it. It's typically carbon monoxide or maybe even a formate. So then the question becomes you can get to a CO, you can get to a formate, but once you have that, how do you get from there to your end goal, which could be a fuel, a polymer, or a product of some kind. And if you have a CO2 molecule, if you want to get it to being in its inorganic carbonate state, what are some of the least energetically intensive pathways to get there?",

So as opposed to thermochemical routes, which is primarily heat intensive, if there is a way for us to get our electrons from renewable sources, looking way out into the future here, that might be another way of trying to go about producing the fuels or the carbonates and carbonates typically going to construction materials or they get buried underground.

Well, I'm working on a kind of device that is called membrane reactor that combines catalysis and membrane in the same tool. And so from any hydrocarbon, I can do the reaction at certain temperature and pressure and then I can make hydrogen and the hydrogen is going only hydrogen is going to permeate through the membrane and it's completely pure. And so we can use this hydrogen to make electricity. And then on the other side of the membrane, I have most of the time I have a stream that is mainly composed by CO2. And so this CO2 can be also converted. So I can make well, not I, there are expertise that can make carbon neutral energy. So in that case we will have carbon free, carbon neutral hydrogen, you know? Because we are just going to furnish hydrogen but we are not going to release CO2 and also CO2 can recycle back in the process that if it will be electrochemical process, you know, or could be like Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and you can use for make from CO2 other ethylene or methanol or ethanol, any kind of synthetic fuel. I'm not I have no expertise what will happen after the CO2, you know? I can just furnish hydrogen and energy and I can also give some CO2 to combine to the other CO2 coming from the carbon negative emissions to make plastic, to sell to beverage company, EOR, you know, could be storage or utilization.",
