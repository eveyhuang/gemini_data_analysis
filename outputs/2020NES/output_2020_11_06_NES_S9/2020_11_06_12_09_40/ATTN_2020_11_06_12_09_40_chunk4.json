I think what might be interesting is in evaluating that thermochemistry and thinking about how we can incorporate carbon negative pathways into that. What do I mean by that? So let's just take the syngas pathway right, the water gas shift reaction. So what we're doing is we're producing carbon dioxide and hydrogen. So if there's a way for us to actually develop a separation pathway to remove the CO2 in a way that is process intensified, that could be one pathway.",

      "transcript": "So in addition to the electrochemical, I would just say chemical, electrochemical, biological. So I would just add chemical across the board because you can try to increase your carbonates in the aqueous phase using absorption routes, adsorption routes, membrane routes without necessarily have to having to go to the electrochemical routes. The electrochemistry is useful when we try to take that carbonate ion or bicarbonate ion and make something else out of it or create that intermediate that goes into making something else. So it helps bridge that pathway in getting to X or Y what have you.",

And if you can do that you you basically win the game. And so it's interesting to hear discussion about ways one would convert the carbonate into something useful because everything I ever hear if you once you get to carbonate you just put it in the ground and get rid of it or you create the carbonate underground and and that's a huge victory. Is there really demand",

So if if there is an electrochemical first step where you activate the CO2 and you've made CO or something like that and and then could that be used to accelerate carbonate formation?",
