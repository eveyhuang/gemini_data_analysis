Every step doesn't have to be electrochemical or or thermocatalytic.

I know that could be done by I think it's thermo it's not thermocatalytic but it's more electrochemical process, you know, converting CO2 in valuable fuel like I don't know, methanol, natural gas. So you can recycle this new fuel that are synthetic fuel to your capture system because in any case you need energy. So it it could be a loop that you are going to remove CO2 but at the same time where the energy is coming from the thermochemical, that one is another story, right? Because in any case we have to consider all the process that require in any case energy and this energy is going to release CO2 in the atmosphere. So I'm always thinking from cradle to grave. Well, I'm a chemical engineer with a background in process, right? So I'm always thinking from A to Z what's going on. Yeah, you can take energy but where energy is coming from, from the grid, from solar panel, from wind. Yeah, so in that case it could be completely negative emission and you can capture CO2 with with the normal sorbent that Climeworks is using. I think that there is also another company and then you can reuse CO2 as a fuel.",

So there is an energy input that you need there to take carbon dioxide to methane, but once you do the pyrolysis, you end up with hydrogen that still contains some of the energy. So maybe you would have to look at the cycle whether the energy that you put in as electricity at the end what percentage of it remains as the hydrogen, right? But if you have a hydrogen economy, in theory you could pump it. Yeah. But making methane just so that you can pyrolyze it, right? If you cannot do direct pyrolysis from carbon dioxide, right?",

And so you can do it on catalysts, but it's it's probably quite energy intensive. But if you can find the energy somewhere that is that it actually makes sense to carbonize the carbon. So I think this is a really interesting perhaps first step for this group is to think about not just methanol but thinking about could you get into could you electrocatalytically even get into you know, carbon, all the way back, reverse the coal cycle, go go back to graphite.",
