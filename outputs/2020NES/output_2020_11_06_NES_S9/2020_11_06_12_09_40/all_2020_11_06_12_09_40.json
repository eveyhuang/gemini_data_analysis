It's the lowest carbon state, right? So if you want to take CO2 and put it in its lowest form, then the most logical pathway for that, at least what we what is in our consciousness at this point is that of magnesium or calcium carbonate. Uh it's an inorganic carbonate. And then if you actually want to take the CO2 and then if you want to upcycle it towards to a fuel, then the intermediate there, you'll need to identify it. It's typically carbon monoxide or maybe even a formate. So then the question becomes you can get to a CO, you can get to a formate, but once you have that, how do you get from there to your end goal, which could be a fuel, a polymer, or a product of some kind. Uh and if you have a CO2 molecule and if you want to get it to being in its inorganic carbonate state, what are some of the least energetically intensive pathways to get there? Right. I think that might be one way of thinking about this challenge, right?",

We are we filed a few patents looking at low temperature, low pressure pathways to get to the carbonate. So that way we can shrink the energy footprint and we can also reduce the cost associated with that. So that's one piece of it. So in many ways learning what nature does and trying to scale that up at you know, at a large scale and eventually taking it to industry. And then once we get to the end carbonate, uh we want to be able to put it into a construction material, we want to be able to use it or we can just stick it into a reclaim mine and just claim that it is in its most stable state at this point. So there are a lot of lessons that we can learn from geology to accelerate these industrial pathways.",

It's just a matter of basically you can process algae to make oils and you can also, you know, do I think I've had like algae yogurt before.

I mean, the percentage and it depends on the algae because there are a lot of variety of algae, but the most used, now I don't remember the Latin name, they have a range that can go can go from 12 to 20% of CO2. If you go higher or lower, they just die. And the problem with algae also, it's not a problem. It's just like that they need a lot of land, you know? Because they have to take sun and they have to take the UV. So they have to be able, you can make stuck, but they have to be able to get the extra ray from the sun, you know, photocatalytic as you said, it's coming from bio.

So um it certainly is viable just as moths are viable for storing methane and things like that. Um so I guess yeah, if you yeah, if you selectively capture CO2 from some sort of point source and then uh you would certainly be able to store it in the moth and transfer it to another location. Um and yeah, people have so I guess yeah, people have looked at like um a lot of like natural gas purification type things where you have like sour natural gas streams, right? So high pressure sources of CO2 and trying to make moths that will selectively store CO2 under high pressure conditions and um that's kind of analogous to just what you would be thinking about if you wanted to have like a compressed CO2 stream so you could store like a really high density such that it was more efficient to to transport it or things like that.",
