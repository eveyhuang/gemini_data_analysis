      "transcript": "and so they would like to grow algae for making biodiesel but we have to be careful when we're going to feed CO2 to the algae because they have to be in a certain concentration. If we're going to feed algae with 100% of CO2 they're going to just to die. I mean the percentage and it depends on the algae because there are a lot of variety of algae but the most used now I don't remember the Latin name they have a range that can go from 12 to 20% of CO2. If you go higher or lower they just die. And the problem with algae also is not a problem it's just like that they need a lot of land you know because they have to take sun and they have to take the UV so they have to be able you can make stack but they have to be able to get the X-ray from the sun you know photocatalytic as you said it's coming from bio. So they need a lot of membrane area no membrane area surface area sorry.",

      "transcript": "There's some really interesting solutions to that that are vertical stack systems systems that sort of process I think for me the biggest issue isn't land area but water is what you need for algae is a lot of water. So it kind of sort of limits where you can do this. because you have to find places that have a lot of water and also a lot of sunlight but a lot of these really cool new vertical systems solve the land problem. And you can you can encourage flow so you can move them through a system rather than having them in a pond and have to process a pond.",

So a lot more in the reclamation sort of like dealing with toxic spills space but yeah there are there are definitely microbe consortia that can that are have better efficiencies at dealing with these kinds of chemicals.",
