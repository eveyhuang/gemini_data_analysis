And so instead of using industrially produced acid and base, you can just electrochemically split it. And then you can weather it and then extract your calcium magnesium ions, react it with the carbonates, produce calcium magnesium carbonate. So that's entirely a viable route.",

      "transcript": "But there are many systems when you have CO2 and you bubble it through a liquid typically it goes to neutral conditions and then but near the surface of the electrode is where you create this high pH when you do hydrogen. There are systems where I think they have introduced magnesium electrodes or aluminum electrodes right because and that helps you precipitate the the carbonate. So as Eva was pointing out the the cation if you're going to store carbonate the question is what is the cation right and how do you introduce it. So I think the the way that Greeshma was mentioning sounds very very interesting right. You separate the two.",

But it's hard to it's hard to think about a porous material that would be abundant enough and and cheap enough and also selective enough where you could actually just store the CO2 inside the material.",
