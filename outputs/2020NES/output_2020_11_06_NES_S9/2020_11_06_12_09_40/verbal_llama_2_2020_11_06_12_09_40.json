It's the lowest carbon state, right? So if you want to take CO2 and put it in its lowest form, then the most logical pathway for that, at least what is in our consciousness at this point, is that of magnesium or calcium carbonate. It's an inorganic carbonate. And then if you actually want to take the CO2 and then if you want to upcycle it towards to a fuel, then the intermediate there, you'll need to identify it. It's typically carbon monoxide or maybe even a formate. So then the question becomes you can get to a CO, you can get to a formate, but once you have that, how do you get from there to your end goal, which could be a fuel, a polymer, or a product of some kind. And if you have a CO2 molecule, if you want to get it to being in its inorganic carbonate state, what are some of the least energetically intensive pathways to get there? ",
