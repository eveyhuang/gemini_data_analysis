I imagine different combinations where depending what you want to make will make maybe more sense to have one set or the other.",

There's a huge opportunity there for 200 gigatons worth and then there's you know a few tens of gigatons worth of chemicals. But every step does not have to be the same, right? Every step doesn't have to be electrochemical or thermocatalytic. So where if you were to design, if you had full leeway, which steps does it make sense to do electrochemically versus enzymatically versus thermocatalytically?",

I know that could be done by I think it's thermo it's not thermocatalytic but it's more electrochemical process, you know, converting CO2 in valuable fuel like I don't know, methanol, natural gas. So you can recycle this new fuel that are synthetic fuel to your capture system because in any case you need energy. So it could be a loop that you are going to remove CO2 but at the same time where the energy is coming from the thermochemical, that one is another story, right? Because in any case we have to consider all the process that require in any case energy and this energy is going to release CO2 in the atmosphere. So I'm always thinking from cradle to grave. Well, I'm a chemical engineer with a background in process, right? So I'm always thinking from A to Z what's going on. Yeah, you can take energy but where energy is coming from? From the grid, from solar panel, from wind. Yeah, so in that case it could be completely negative emission and you can capture CO2 with the normal sorbent that Climeworks is using. I think that there is also another company and then you can reuse CO2 as a fuel or you can make also methanol and you can sell methanol. But I don't know if what could be what are the challenges here.",
