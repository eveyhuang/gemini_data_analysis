So to Peter's point about carbonate formation, uh yes, there are ways to accelerate that at high temperature and high pressure. We are we filed a few patents looking at low temperature, low pressure pathways to get to the carbonate. So that way we can shrink the energy footprint and we can also reduce the cost associated with that. So that's one piece of it. So in many ways learning what nature does and trying to scale that up at you know, at a large scale and eventually taking it to industry. And then once we get to the end carbonate, uh we want to be able to put it into a construction material, we want to be able to use it or we can just stick it into a reclaim mine and just claim that it is in its most stable state at this point. So there are a lot of lessons that we can learn from geology to accelerate these industrial pathways.",

So I'm guessing Pete would be the same way like adding certain microorganisms to the to the right mixture of moisture and soil.",

I mean, as much as CO2 utilization is economical in general, I mean, a lot of the the chemical pathways that have been discussed so far are not really economical. It's an uphill battle. I think algae do photosynthesis, right? They are they have chloroplasts. So in some way you don't have to push something uphill, it's already a process that's happening. It's just a matter of basically you can process algae to make oils and you can also, you know, do I think I've had like algae yogurt before. There are lots of different ways you can sort of deal with the biomass that algae produce because as they photosynthesize, they grow. So you're really producing biomass.",
