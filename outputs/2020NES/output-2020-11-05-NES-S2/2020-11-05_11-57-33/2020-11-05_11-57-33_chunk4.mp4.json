Um, I think it makes a lot of sense just because you're like if you're offshore, you could potentially couple it with nice, you know, um CO2 storage sites that are also offshore and just do it like an offshore rig basically where you're taking the CO2 and then storing it underground on site.

So are there strategies one could employ to design more physiosorbing sites that would still absorb CO2 selectively? Um, and the the nice thing about some of the inorganic or hybrid materials like moths is you imagine that your toolbox is huge for the types of uh sites that you could potentially design. So that you design a very high density of more weakly binding sites and still grab enough CO2 at these ultra dilute conditions, um without having to repay that massive enthalpy penalty that all these strong chemisorbing materials pay.",

I guess the challenge we often faced was and just um actually being able to do that in a way that would still give you a a high capacity and reasonable porosity so that you would have reasonable diffusion kinetics through the pores of your materials and things like that. Um, one real semi related I guess idea um that I've been semi curious about but have never really thought through in a lot of of detail is there might be any strategies where you could think about not just tuning in the enthalpy of the interaction of CO2 with the porous material but also somehow impacting the overall entropy change and it's orbit undergoes an interaction with CO2. There's not much you're going to be able to do in terms of changing the intrinsic entropy of CO2 absorbing inside a porous material unless it can somehow still be mobile um and is less confined to the surface. So maybe you could do something but if the in a responsive absorbent uh an absorbent that structure changes in response to absorption or in particular the dynamics of some sort of organic functional group or something change in response to an absorbent in a way that confers some type of entropic advantage um that would drive more CO2 into the material even at a lower enthalpy window if there's potential opportunities there that haven't really been explored.",

So we have a nice mix of people in the Silog fellows program and um I imagine that one of the things that will make the proposals you all will write in the future uh successful will be when possible the coupling of smart experiments with smart computation. So are there particular areas that you think are ripe for that sort of collaboration?",

So we could actually go go at it from both the size, not just the thermodynamics actually. So you can bring in kinetics at that point.",

Um, so that's as an experimentalist, we can test things, we can measure things, but um, rationalizing data will be helpful with um theory. Um, if that's another direction, complex separations.",
