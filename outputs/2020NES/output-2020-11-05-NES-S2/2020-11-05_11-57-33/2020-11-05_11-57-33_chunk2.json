A lot of times what what I'm seeing is often oxide surfaces are used. But very common facets are used. From my understanding, there are a lot of defective oxide surfaces and how, you know, the thermodynamics and kinetics actually are going to occur on some of those surfaces. I think is also critical, not everything is known and what I feel is like we can use the defects. A lot of times these surfaces have defects because there could be, you know, charge accumulation, charge polarity, all those other things. Those defects actually can we can use it to our advantage. I have to admit I don't know exactly how, but I have seen it used to other, you know, advantage in other fields. And I think there is definitely some possibility to understand the reaction mechanisms on different facets simply by, you know, uh taking you know, taking a route of very fundamental uh understanding both from experiment and theory. This is just something unless uh you know, there is something more to what I'm saying here.",

Uh you know, sometimes people ask about uh what's the road map for carbon dioxide conversion. Then that that question trace back to because this is a downstream that is connected to the carbon dioxide capture, right? If I don't know exactly uh the development status or the road map or let's say the uh the current state of the art uh projection of these um technologies, then I don't have an answer to others saying that my technology when that can be used in a large scale or in more practice. So what I mean is there is a missing of the it's the same way vice verse, right? For the carbon dioxide capture uh scientists, they probably also wants to know like what the Jennifer just mentioned the the utilization of the as a downstream uh road. Uh the the question is how to build up this bridge is actually very critical. Uh and by knowing both fields, you know exactly how this industry can grow up uh both scientifically and also economically because you need that motivation from the market to drive that through for a long time.",
