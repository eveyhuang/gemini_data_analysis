            "transcript": "And I will say a little bit since there's plenty bit of pause here. Um and and Chris, I know you have to go, I don't know, he's going to go teach I think in a little bit. So I'll I'll be closing us up. But um but I think it's also important to distinguish between the different technologies of direct air capture. Uh they're all very different, you know, and so if it's an electro swing approach and you can turn it off and on and you can you don't need thermal energy in order to regenerate, that's very flexible and a benefit of that kind of an approach. If it's a you know, a global thermostat or a climeworks type of an approach where you can use low grade heat or even maybe coupling really low grade heat to heat pumps uh is an opportunity where you could couple to things like waste heat uh which is a lot of what climeworks is doing today and and if you're interested in that, we wrote a paper on that uh just came out in the spring. coupling to low grade heat from nuclear and also geothermal. Uh but when you take a carbon engineering type approach uh where they require 900 degrees C heat for regeneration, it's not so easy to imagine coupling that. You can't couple that to low there's no such thing as low grade 900 degrees C heat. Waste heat at 900 degrees C. So in that case you do need a dedicated plant that produces thermal energy and uh electric energy for that process. And so I think one thing that I try and do in the messaging of direct air capture is that not all direct air capture technologies are created equal and they're going to couple to energy resources in different ways uh and they're going to be in that case cited in different ways. So the concept of putting a direct air capture plant anywhere is a bit of a short sighted view. And maybe that even we can transition into something like that too and talking about that. And it's not just the energy. Um you know, but there some of these approaches do require water. Some are net producers of water. Some require expensive feed stocks for the materials to actually do the separation. Are have you in your in your work uh have you guys given some consideration of those types of things outside of the energy requirements.",
