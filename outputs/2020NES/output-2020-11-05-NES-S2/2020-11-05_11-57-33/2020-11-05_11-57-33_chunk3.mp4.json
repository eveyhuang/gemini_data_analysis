And um for us there is a wide range of chemical space that has remained unexplored um in terms of what molecules can bind um uh CO2 after electrochemical activation and then also release it uh either thermally or or electrochemically. And I think, you know, there are just a lot of of known compounds that combine carbon dioxide have been just quite literally tabulated in terms of free energy of binding that could potentially be um kind of a a playing ground to to try to identify some of these new new technologies that can then be um then interfaced with a heterogeneous support and and you know, we come from a small molecule um uh world but um there's just a lot of potential um um uh to get uh some new new technologies out there that kind of um alleviate some of these um uh limitations in thermo in in terms of of of thermal thermal capture and and and and storage.

Because that's all you need. Carbon dioxide to us is like the world the world's worst electrophile. Think about it, right? Um and so if you can electrochemically generate a nucleophile from a compound that you can then break down uh from um either uh introduction of an electron into an anti-bonding orbital. Um, you know, there's just uh you know, things like N heterocyclic carbines, you know, you can generate from simple azolium that's well known reaction studied for for eons and you know, um just kind of trying to map out some space um in that in that realm for us would be very interesting.",

And in the amount and for instance with the oxygen and its interactions with quinones and how that interferes with CO2 reactivity. And the fact that in an exhaust stream it's reducing, right? So in the exhaust stream you have a lot less oxygen than you do in the atmosphere. And so just thinking about those different conditions, I think it's important. Um, and that when we separate CO2, it's not a separation from CO2 and nitrogen. Rarely. I don't know of a situation where it looks like that. So I I think it is also important to just think about as Kelsey you just mentioned, not just the different concentration of CO2 that you're separating from that initial purity of CO2, but also what are the other gases that you have to kind of fight against, you know, when you think of selective CO2 chemistry.",

So one thought is we could do this offshore to kind of free up some more space. Um, a couple other things. It also helps with ocean acidification. So if you're removing CO2, it also helps the pH, which could be really helpful for certain marine environments. Um, and then just from like I'm an engineer, so from that perspective, uh, if you're dealing with like a really dense working fluid instead of the air, it could also have some advantages. Um, so those are just a few, but I mean there are also some challenges certainly that come with it like dealing with ocean, you know, junk like I don't know what else to call it. There's you know, there's life, there's like, you know, fouling, all sorts of stuff happens when you deal with seawater and you don't want to mess up seawater either by changing the pH too much.
