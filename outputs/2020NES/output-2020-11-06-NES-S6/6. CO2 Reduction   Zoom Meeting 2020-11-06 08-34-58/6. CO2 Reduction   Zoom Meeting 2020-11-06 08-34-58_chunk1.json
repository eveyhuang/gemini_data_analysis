But I think a lot of people because they've usually worked in an organics, a lot of people discount them and that's a very fair criticism, but you can mimic organic environments by using relatively cheap polymer materials. In terms of controlled transport of water and protons and stuff. And I think I don't think that's been figured out because I don't think a lot of people look at that because a lot of people that would be well poised to look at the discount molecular systems because of the problems that they have.",

So could we open up uh new materials that we would have not been able to do? And and there are two things that happen with single atom. One, it it attacks two things at once, which I think makes it an very exciting material set. It it first attacks the cost question like you pointed out, um actually. And then the second thing it actually attacks is it it brings out new ways of making materials look like other materials, right? So meaning that because you have a single atom, it behaves very differently than the bulk atom. Right? So you can suddenly make like and I guess I mean um you know, you know, this is sort of known in the molecular world, but uh you know, I guess the heterogeneous catalysis is catching up to it, right? That uh that you suddenly have one, you know, iron becoming like platinum or or or like gold. And and so then you can have cheaper single atoms even uh that give you the same sort of functionality. And the design space now is almost unlimited, right? You can now do single atom alloy catalyst. So like like two atom alloys. Um and then and of course whatever is the host uh support uh that is hosting that single atom anchor. Um and I think now uh it's at the point where the single atom density. So that density question that is problematic in the in the bio world is now actually largely solved. Like you can get these single atoms to be isolated in pockets that are not too far off and get sort of densities to be uh very high. So in terms of material set, I think um single atom and single atom single alloy atom SAA uh or Single atom alloy, yeah. single atom alloy, yeah. Single atom alloy, those are I think very exciting material sets where I think there's almost you know, no no picture on on the CO2 reduction.",

If you're trying to you know, uh tease out some universal principles like yes, we want single atoms well dispersed but at high density and that where you can tweak the local environments to such a high degree that you can very precisely engender a certain type of reactivity, right? And and uh hopefully sustain that over over a certain certain period of time and then get whatever product you're looking to get. Um so one of the things that struck me from Julia's presentation about, you know, uh she said the big win is of course fuels, liquid fuels, right? Because that was something like 200 gigatons and everything else was like less than one. Um so is there a pathway to a liquid fuel or any other fuel that you see or is it much easier to do something much more simple?",

But to go back to the prompt which is like how do we move toward a complete picture of CO2 reduction. One thing that I just wanted to like synthesize from the discussion of the alloys and the single atom catalyst and enzymes and proteins is that what we're basically saying is and also I think they're really good point to make sure to highlight Ashley from that Provine basically mentioned is we need industrial relevant benchmarking metrics that can be applied to any catalyst system. Um and so maybe it's turnover number or maybe it's dollar per active site of a catalyst or maybe it's um but like I think that's something that is necessary because without that like without benchmarking all these different catalysts and types of catalysts are um it's really hard to compare them, right? Um and so I think that that's um it's something really hard to we don't even do that when we compare thermal catalytic systems and electro catalytic systems and I would argue that it's actually quite easy to compare thermal and electro catalytic, but then we don't then we don't we definitely don't do it when we start to look at biocatalysis and um and these other um you know, enzymes and you know, different routes. And so I think that's really necessary to start guiding um what directions are are likely to succeed.",
