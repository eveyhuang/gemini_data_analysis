And you have to have inline and I know there are ways of doing this, but one of the issues that for instance, the high throughput experimentation group at formally at J cap now at Lisa has always run into and why they haven't really published in this phase space very much is it's easy to measure currents, it's hard to measure products inline, especially when you're making small amounts of product.",
