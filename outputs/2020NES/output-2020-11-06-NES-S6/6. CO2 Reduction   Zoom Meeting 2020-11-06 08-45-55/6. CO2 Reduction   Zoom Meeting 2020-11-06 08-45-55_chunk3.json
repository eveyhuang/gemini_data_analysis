Um and and so the benchmarking point I think is a really good one also from because we're not talking about like Charles mentioned that what has gone down in the last two versions of hubs, but really much more systems level analysis about benchmarking um where you might then very quickly come to the realization that things like photocatalysis is going to be exceedingly difficult or would require a complete redesign of reactors. Um and so again, there's perhaps certain aspects of it that you might want to do but not others.",

So if there is things you can do by photocatalysis, I think those are those would be would be definitely in the in the realm of this. Like if there if there are new opportunities that can be unrolled, but but to look critically at what's been done. So in a in a sense, for example, I think BES has an agenda that folks perhaps have not agreed as much of it in terms of both batteries and and catalysis. So so we don't have to subscribe to that, but we can definitely have a conversation. There's nothing nothing that is out of um out of the realm of, you know, SciLogs.",
