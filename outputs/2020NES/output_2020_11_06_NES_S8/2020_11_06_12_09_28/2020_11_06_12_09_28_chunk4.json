So I'm really interested in the ideas of um trying to design both the structure of porous materials at a macro scale, but also the materials that you put into them and how you place them. And I feel like that's kind of the really critical thing to think about in these problems and how you layer different materials together and get the the flow properties that you need of the gases through to get the residence times and the exposure to whatever catalyst or dopant you have. I think that's a really interesting problem that could really benefit from kind of these collaborations at all levels of modeling and experiments because if we can use models to iterate and say this looks kind of like it might be the right direction, can you go into the lab and see about fabricating it?",
