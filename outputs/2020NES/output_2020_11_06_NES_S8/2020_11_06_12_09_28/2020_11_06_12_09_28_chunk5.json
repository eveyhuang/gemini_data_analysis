So in interior you have higher pH, so you do get the CC coupling products, but in the exterior you're still doing basically to methane or hydrogen. And so you end up still getting these distributions. It's almost like if you could have something on the front end that could control the pH before you get to the interior layers.",

Uh and and Wendy Shaw actually had some really interesting work not related to HER, but she had some really interesting work where she had a polymer that she sprinkled in like a nickel system that uh reversibly coordinated air. I think it coordinates oxygen and then you can heat it up or something to release it later. But so she could she could scavenge air that oxygen that way and then do she was doing it for hydrogen uh uh proton reduction, but it's because she had an air she could do the system without having to put everything under nitrogen.",
