      "transcript": "so what I mean is you have you you have your electrode you have a polymer on top of it that polymer wicks water from water vapor there's no clean water so you have a sandwich of a polymer like between two electrodes one of the electrodes could be porous so you have CO2 coming in and then the interior just wicks from water vapor but high temperature so like a MEA but all vapor",
