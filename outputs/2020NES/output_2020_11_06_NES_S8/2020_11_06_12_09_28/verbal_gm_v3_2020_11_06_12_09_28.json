From my perspective release when you're going to capture CO2 and release it to a conversion technology. From my perspective it's not necessarily the concentration of CO2, it's the concentration of oxygen. Oxygen is your killer for any conversion technology because you will always preferentially reduce oxygen. So if you can separate CO2 from oxygen that's like the key. And that's I know it's hard to do certainly with membranes and polymers that's like impossible right but but not impossible but it's very hard to do. Ionic liquids can do it but separating that CO2 from oxygen because you can do if you have reaction selectivity if you can engineer that into your system through microenvironments or catalyst design then even if you have dilute CO2 streams feeding in probably needs to be more concentrated than 300 ppm but but if you have dilute CO2 streams feeding in you can drive the catalysis albeit slowly and the conversion without a lot of competitive processes but if you have any O2 you just won't do any CO2 reduction you'll only do O2 reduction. That's my on that aspect. And in terms of CO2 I think it's all the overpotential you need to get to reasonable rates it's it's the energy conversion efficiency. There was an interesting in the last session we just talked about there was a big discussion the last breakout session on on CO2 reduction in general the big discussion was catalysts don't usually catalyst costs usually don't matter because membranes out balance of systems and membranes are the big cost driver but energy efficiency sort of does. And we don't have any electrocatalysts that operate at good potentials versus thermodynamic potential. Okay I'll. Anyway that's just my view though you know other people should. ",
