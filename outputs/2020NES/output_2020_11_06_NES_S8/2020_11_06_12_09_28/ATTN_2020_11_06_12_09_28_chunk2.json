Can novel materials and electrode architectures facilitate CO2 capture and utilization? What are the fundamental design principles for electrocatalysts and how can their discovery and optimization be accelerated? So that's our topic. And I think it it's worked well in the other breakout sessions if if everybody takes a a minute or two and and writes down a a question or idea that you have pertaining to this topic. So we'll be quiet for a minute or two and everybody please try try to do that.",

Um what that does to reaction distributions and product distributions I don't know. Um and then so you use a porous um a porous membrane or polymer to wick water from steam and use that as your proton source in the catalytic process. Um and then the other thing just in general is this idea of using overlayers or polymers to control delivery but also control the secondary coordination sphere either in heterogeneous solid state systems, nanoparticle systems or molecular systems. Of course that's what I work on so of course I care about that but that's the other big thing that I think is is underexplored in this area.",
