But there's obviously other metrics, the rate at which you capture it, the purity of you're getting, how deep you capture from. And then also, I mean, with conversion then it's the purity of what you're making, the value of what you're making. And I'm just sort of struggling to figure out, you know, like we can develop new materials, but beyond just like a trial and error of improving those materials, like what metric are you actually aiming for?

From my perspective, it's not necessarily the concentration of CO2, it's the concentration of oxygen. Oxygen is your killer for any conversion technology because you will always preferentially reduce oxygen. So if you can separate CO2 from oxygen, that's like the key. And that's, I know it's hard to do, certainly with membranes and polymers, that's like impossible, right? But but not impossible, but it's very hard to do. Um, ionic liquids can do it. But separating that CO2 from oxygen, because you can do if you have reaction selectivity, if you can engineer that into your system through micro environments or catalyst design, then even if you have dilute CO2 streams feeding in, probably needs to be more concentrated than 300 ppm, but but if you have dilute CO2 streams feeding in, you can drive the catalysis, albeit slowly, uh, and the conversion without a lot of competitive processes. But if you have any O2, you just won't do any CO2 reduction. You'll only do O2 reduction. Um, that's my on that aspect. And in terms of CO2, I think it's all the over potential you need to get to reasonable rates. It's it's the energy conversion efficiency. Um, there was an interesting in the last session we just talked about, there was a big discussion, the last breakout session on on CO2 reduction in general. The big discussion was catalysts don't usually catalyst costs usually don't matter because membranes out balance the systems and membranes you're the big cost driver. But energy efficiency sort of does. And we don't have any electric catalysts that operate at good potentials versus thermodynamic potential. Okay, I'll",

And I feel like that's kind of the really critical thing to think about in these problems and how you layer different materials together and get the the flow properties that you need of the gases through to get the residence times and the exposure to whatever catalyst or dopant you have. I think that's a really interesting problem that could really benefit from kind of these collaborations at all levels of modeling and experiments because if we can use models to iterate and say this looks kind of like it might be the right direction, can you go into the lab and see about fabricating it?",

        "transcript": "the the the the third one that it says how can the discovery and optimization be accelerated, meaning um, you know, the sign principles, right? So the first thing that I try to enumerate, it's what design principles do we know so far, right? The only thing that I could come up with is you need overlap orbitals for conductivity. Uh when you have a catalyst, you need certain regions of redox potential to do CO2 products. You cannot go too far, you can go too far um far up or down because you lose a lot of energy. Um, you need something that lose selectivity versus uh something that it's very effective at converting that electron into transferring to those orbitals. Um, but at the same time, I was thinking that um to accelerate all this uh the discovery of uh of electrocatalysis and fundamental uh design principles is there is a need for information flow, right? So when we were thinking about or when I was drawing this modular thing, I realized that the information flow if you switch it, let's say information flow from atomic to macro modeling, but also information flow now you change the nomenclature and you call every chemical an information piece, right? So every step is now an information flow and um something goes in, something goes out, but also we don't have many every time there is an information exchange across any module, across any process, we lose information and probably because we never do the interactions. So yeah, when I try to put all these design principles and try to accelerate it, I think the information flow it's it's a key ingredient that we're missing. Um, and then after I realized that and I try to put all these the very little design principles that I can come up with, I you know, you can start drawing things. So I draw all the all the all the kinds of things like, you know, um a moth, for example, where you have the secondary building unit, but the secondary building unit could be, you know, something that it does um copper oxide and then the other secondary building could be OEC to do the water or um and then you can control the length, so you can control the selectivity versus the effectiveness. But it comes down to um, you know, all this information flow and uh the main thing that we seems to always have to take care of when they do the design at least at the atomic level is the overlap of the orbitals for conductivity and also for the redox potential, so it doesn't generate a lot of many other byproducts that you don't want. But yeah, this is my uh two cents um taking into account inflations from 70s.",
