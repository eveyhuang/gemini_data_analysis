So in other words what nature is doing right so it real probably realized itself that we cannot have everything for ourselves we need to give out something. So you need to give out a little bit of the energy to generate itself let's say for a you know catalytic system and it decays after a while but then it it gains at the end overall something but it's not 100%. So are there any systems out there that you sacrifice a little bit on the regeneration you still get a positive output right so um some transformation but it's not 100% but you probably gain on I don't know selectivity and it's more you know it's probably more organic. Um but so so it's not as strict as a stiff as a system that you want it to last forever. So a flexible system.
