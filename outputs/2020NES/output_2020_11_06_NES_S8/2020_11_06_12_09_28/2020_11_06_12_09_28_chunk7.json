So you need to give out a little bit of energy to generate itself, let's say for uh you know, catalytic system and it decays after a while. But then it it it gains at the end overall something, but it's not 100%. So are there any systems out there that you sacrifice a little bit on the regeneration, uh you still get a positive output, right? So um some transformation, but it's not 100%. But you probably gain on I don't know, selectivity and it's more you know, it's probably more organic. Um but so so it's not as strict as uh stiff as a system that you wanted to last forever. So a flexible system. Is that the flexibility uh uh the same word to saying not completely uh 100% um useful or or or stability?",
