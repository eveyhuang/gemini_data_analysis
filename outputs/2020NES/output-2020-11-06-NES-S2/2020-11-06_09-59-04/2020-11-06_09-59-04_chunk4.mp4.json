And I I think as much data you have, like this system you have this data and this system you have that data and that system you have other data. If you if somebody can model that and get reasonable results, then you have some confidence that what you're doing is going to work. The the big question here about how do we facilitate this conversations? I mean, that's what research corporation is doing with this conversation because I think, you know, until you sit down and have conversations with people, the vocabularies are different and it's hard for people, you know, just by reading the paper to figure out can can I work in this area? And uh a half hour conversation can make it clear whether, you know, you could offer something to this and you might be able to do a collaboration. So, um, I mean more uh gatherings like this is definitely um was something that would be uh a great way to continue to facilitate those conversations and get down more into the nitty gritty.",

Uh and you know, so some people are going to say they can model it, but uh that's that's because they're they're looking to, you know, get on my paper or whatever. Um, but but you want to make sure that you really uh are are doing rigorous stuff that that is is really capturing it and not sort of putting a square peg in a round hole so to speak.

So even the basic, you know, uh yeah, communicating the basis of what the theory can do would be important. Um, and I'm talking about in a way that is digestible to the average experimentalist because you know, mostly things you find in theory journals and computational journals if you're most people look at it and then after you get through with the introduction it's like, okay, what does this mean? And if you don't have somebody to break it down for you, you know, so I guess that it goes back to the education component because we're at least in most places we don't teach this um early on. So, you know, most people learn these things in the graduate level.",

So is there a way for us to actually go back a little bit and um can we think about the challenges that we have in this area, right?
