And uh we'll also um after we finish that up, we will have uh some more discussion about um proposal writing, some uh answer questions and so on. And then we have another couple of uh mini breakout sessions in the afternoon to give an opportunity uh for um to give an opportunity for fellows to do more brainstorming uh and uh have potential to form groups uh or just get new ideas. And of course, we'll finish with a social mixer and the um on gather and you know, hopefully as many folks as want to show up there can. Um, that will be that'll be fun, hopefully. Um, want to remind folks uh on on uh looking for teams, looking for people, you can use the help wanted uh document that we created. I've already seen some people have put information in there about ideas for projects and team members they might be looking for. So that's a good idea.
