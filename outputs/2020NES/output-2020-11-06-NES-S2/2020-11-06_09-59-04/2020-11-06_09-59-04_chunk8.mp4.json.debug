I think something Emily said earlier like when you're trying to model a big system the data is really expensive, right? So like modeling how like a pilot plant would work to know if your model is at all accurate. Like to have data from a pilot plant, right? So if you want modeling long-term stability, if you want to know how well your uh wind farm is going to be working 30 or 50 years from now. It's kind of hard to how accurate is your model going to be until you know you have a 50-year-old wind farm. That's I guess that's the challenge.",

So if you want modeling long-term stability, if you want to know how well your uh wind farm is going to be working 30 or 50 years from now. It"s kind of hard to how accurate is your model going to be until you know you have a 50-year-old wind farm. That"s I guess that"s the challenge.",
