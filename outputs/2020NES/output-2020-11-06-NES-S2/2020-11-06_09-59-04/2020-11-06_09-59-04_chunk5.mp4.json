So this uh you know, doing the capture and we've to Louisa's point, right? We we've kind of approached director capture of, okay, I'm used to doing gas separations. How can I apply technology I have in hand to this problem of director capture? And and it's akin to saying how you know, how the locomotive engineers laughed at the Wright brothers for trying to make an airplane. Well, you know, and ultimately the Wright brothers didn't design a train that could fly. They made a plane.",

And and the cost and the time, etc with doing that is is great, right? And so especially with with COVID, things are shutting down even further, but can you use computational methods to help accelerate that design and make it more effective and efficient so that you're spending your time and money more wisely. And that gets back to I know I heard a couple people say about multi scale, right? So my modeling could help on a system level design perhaps, how how fast the air is flowing, what kind of thicknesses we want for these, etc. But it's not unless I get parameterization or information from DFT or experiments, I can't tell you exactly what the reactions look like, right? I I need somebody to tell me that so I can and then you also get into the issue which really brought up of or maybe we have a little bit uncertainty analysis or uncertainty and its propagation, right? So if you're doing a DFT model, there's uncertainty and you propagate that to MD, there's uncertainty. If you make that big jump to trying to model device, what about all that uncertainty? And you need to compound all that to understand I think you said it moment ago Matt, risk, right? The risk of associated with this.",

They've had for a number of years the carbon capture simulation initiative that they started back in maybe 2010-ish. But that was looking at this idea for one specific device. They were looking at post combustion capture using sorbins and then they moved a bit into solvents, but asking exactly this of how can we go from a material that will work through a device into a power plant, how that affects the long-term risk and everything. And that was a big conversation that's been had around it and it's still going on more with industry now, but the idea of trying to accelerate the whole process using computation and statistics.",

            "transcript": "I think from a systems level perspective, the the biggest question for me, especially as we're in the category of negative emissions technologies is what are the processes that have the least energy requirement because the thermal energy and the electric energy that you need for these processes are what is going to be driving your carbon or net carbon reduction. If we think about the carbon in the atmosphere, 75% of it can be traced back to how we use it to make electric and thermal energy. And so I think the step forward in negative emissions technologies is some kind of system that has reduced energy requirements. I mean towards uh Adam's comment about uh like perspective pieces, one of the the National Academies put out a study on direct air carbon removal systems and they had uh the from what I I don't model this directly, I model the energy requirements. So the the biggest thing problem that I see now is the high uh thermal process requirements. You have to have the solvents or the sorbins at like 900 degrees Celsius and to get there you need to burn a lot of natural gas. So what is there a way to make the capture process more energy efficient from a materials perspective or uh yeah, I don't know.",
