So, yeah, all these prototypes are set up where there's waste heat that can help, um, make the process more more efficient. Um, in the let me throw out something else though that, um, Kristen just reminded me of about making other fuels. Uh, in the keynote yesterday, the speaker did talk about if you take CO2 and you're able to make it into a useful fuel, you know, you're recycling your fuel, I guess. And, uh, uh, that's you know, she said that would be one of the the big wins, you know, if you could figure out how to make CH4 or some longer chain hydrocarbon, which means you need catalysts, um, to in order to do that. So then people have to be working on how do you, you know, what do you do in in terms of making a better catalyst and put the right molecules together to uh, try to um, make some fuels that would be useful and then you could start taking less stuff out of the ground.",

Uh, so so one of the uh the sessions yesterday, the the question came up about what's really net negative versus just offsetting current emissions and and one of the funder, one of the private funder uh takes on this was anything that just sort of displaces or or reduces our our current emissions is not in the same category to them as as a true net negative. Uh and so I'm I'm wondering if the the processes like capture turning it into fuel that will get burned again if the broader perspective of the the conference here is that those are also of interest um or if if we have a really strict definition of negative emission.",

And an actual negative emissions as the improvement of say a catalyst or a system gets better that that the version 0.5 um is not in fact negative. But is a is a necessary step in the basic science to get to version 2.0 which actually now achieves your goal. Does that help uh Yeah, yeah, that's great.",

So so we have this, you know, how do we facilitate conversations? We're talking about defining a wish list for experimentalists would like to be able to model, perspective articles, tutorial meetings. Um, and then I was just trying to capture a lot what people were saying about specific challenges uh relevant to negative emission sciences. So like maybe starting this wish list, like a little some of these are like could be things that would be on that wish list. So modeling solvent effects, simulating a reaction at constant potential. Um, about so then maybe this is the what what would the the theorists or the computational people like to be able to see like what inputs are they missing from to help sort of validate their theories. Um, does this seem? And then some possible approaches that we've talked about, we talked about using computational approaches like life cycle assessment, you know, modeling energy requirements. So this is what um I think Andrea and Kristen were talking about, you know, using these sort of bigger system level um computational approaches to help guide the choices experimentalists make when they're trying to pursue various materials or approaches. Um, ruling out those that are not going to be viable but also and also defining benchmarks to meet to to get you into the sort of negative emissions zone. Um, am I missing anything? what else or So here's kind of my picture of what we've talked about so far.",

And I I think it's a real problem in the academy because, you know, assistant professors feel like they're always being judged and that they have to be the smartest person in the room. And so you go to a ACS meeting and, you know, it starts up here and then it finishes up here and most of the people in the audience are lost in the first five minutes except for the people who are really, you know, tuned into that. So I think this idea of having the tutorial sessions followed by um discussions and just a lot more question and answer where people don't feel um threatened like they have to be uh, you know, know everything, right? So otherwise, how do we get to a point where people can even understand what each other is talking about and being able to say, oh, so you're so you're saying that you could model this with your with with your experiment or with your with your theory and, you know, yes or no or maybe, you know, might be the answer, but the getting that dialogue going, I think um is hard because of the way academia is set up.
