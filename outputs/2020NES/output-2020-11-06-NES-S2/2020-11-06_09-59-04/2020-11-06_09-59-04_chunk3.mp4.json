You're a lot of big assumptions that are being made, so the theory is not as accurate. So you really need to know if it works. So you need to have data that you can say, oh, this makes sense, that we're actually um can trust this model so that when we apply it to something that's a related system, we feel like we've got uh a good handle on this. Or or even to know what your error bars are, right?",

And so this question of how you go from those calculations up to the scale of what actually is put into a device, right? So even in bench scale experiments, you can have an idealized model system that you're looking at, but then if we're talking about going all the way to putting it into some sort of device, the manufacturing fabrication is not going to be as perfect and how do you account for let's say defects um or other issues that kind of arise in the overall machine that'll affect performance or device.",

Uh maybe a call for experimentalists to design systems that are slightly more idealized uh that that can be handled and kind of bridged for theory. So, you know, I I think of things like surface science, single crystal kind of experiments in catalysis. Um, you know, they're they're not completely representative of what a polydisperse, you know, nanoparticle kind of catalyst system is going to look like in the end, but if you do single crystal work on all the different facets and then try to interpret the nanoparticle is is kind of a combination of those.",

Uh so when I was working with and I always like to ask them to also can they measure some like more well-known system and I could also try to see whether or not the simulation can well reproduce that because when they are synthesizing new materials, there could be some defect and something else. I mean we we just don't know. So I always love to just pick up a few simple system. I mean well known system not simple and try to start to work on that to see whether or not we can get the same. I mean at least to make sure that the theory and experiments they are on the same page. It just always the thing that I I I try to get started with.",

What what's what's the mechanism for theorists to communicate to an to experimentalists what what's realistic to to get out of a calculation and and then in the opposite direction, what's realistic in terms of well uh well defined system kind of generation to to have something that approaches the experiment more. Um the the immediate thing that I think of is is just writing sort of perspective kind of articles where you get people who who maybe do work at at the interfaces more so so people who work with really well defined experimental systems. Um you know, just just trying to put out there in in a very uh clear clear way, you know, this this is basically as good as an experimental system gets. Um and and then have that contrasted by by theorists and in terms of, you know, okay, even from that most idealized system, uh I still have to make the following assumptions in order to model it.",

So all the observable experiment observable will show a faithful match or agreement with the sematical prediction. For example, when we are studying electrochemistry, we measure different parameters, right? Turn over frequency, to fail slopes. I want to see when I'm collaborating with theorist, can they can also deliver expected turn over frequency, to fail slopes or rates can show a faithful match with experimental results. And then in this case because all the reaction has different pathways, right? With this faithful match we can elucidate the reaction mechanism.",

And so when you go to the modeling, then we have to also try and make a guess of of what's going on. So there's I guess there's a lot of layers of uncertainty, I'd say sometimes between the measurement that you're taking and the level at which the physics is happening that causes that.
