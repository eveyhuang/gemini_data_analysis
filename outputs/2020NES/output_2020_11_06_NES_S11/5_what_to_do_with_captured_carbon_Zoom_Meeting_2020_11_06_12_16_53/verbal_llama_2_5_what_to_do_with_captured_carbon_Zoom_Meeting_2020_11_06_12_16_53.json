Right so it probably makes more sense to make jet fuel from the CO2 from the flue stack rather than directly from the atmosphere if you're competing head-to-head. So I'm just wondering unless there is a synergism that okay something about capture from air then then couples with something that cannot be done with a flue gas. So actually actually maybe then another story I can I can tell is that one of the challenges with flue gas is that often it's not pure right so often has some some impurities and so maybe that CO2 capture from from air will be cleaner so then maybe there's a process that requires a cleaner CO2 and then that's how you you you avoid having to purify flue gas. You then capture it directly from from air if if that makes economic sense. ",

Um but mostly just kind of pulling from the group and your background and and skill sets and and um your you know young minds just entering this field that are excited to have an impact. And so maybe thinking about just like the basic skill sets that you have and how would you think about combining things you know whether it's CO2 into a carbonate that could be used as a feedstock for synthetic aggregate for concrete and construction or whether the CO2 is a feedstock to be combined with hydrogen for methanol maybe because it's hard to transport hydrogen but easier to transport methanol. Um you know maybe the CO2 is avoided from a power plant and that's cheaper and easier um but ultimately you don't get any removal benefit from that that's only avoiding the emissions to the atmosphere. So I I mean just just thinking openly you know about what your skill sets are here your background how it could collectively be uh combined in a collaborative way to think of a proposal idea um that would kind of be super exciting and game-changing and um and and just thinking about some of these challenges the fact that you know I really like what Julia also said is like jet fuel's an issue and if we can figure out how to make it in a synthetic way then you know not only are we doing something with that CO2 in terms of a waste management path but we're also you know removing ourselves from our dependence on crude oil in the earth too so it has that co-benefit. Um but all of these these topics of what to do with CO2 whether it's a feedstock to a chemical or a fuel or whether it's a carbonate um I think it's just meant to be you know brainstorming an idea that collectively you might be able to combine skill sets to have a unique um proposal idea you know ultimately.

So you could take your direct air capture there unit there capture CO2 and then inject it into the mining tailings to then do mineral carbonation of the mining tailings right so this is a well accepted idea many people in Canada Australia and so on work on this but they usually assume that they're getting the CO2 directly from the air but if we can capture the CO2 and concentrate it then we're going to be weathering those tailings a lot faster and maybe even more than just by by waiting for the the air to do it so that would be a large scale potential application.

But when you add oxalate or or oxalic acid to the solution it actually helps to dissolve the magnesium and make it reactive for crystallization and mineralization with CO2. And so one of the things like the Opus 12 was looking at is working with a company called Solidia and so very different but looking at Solidia's process I don't know if you guys know Solidia is a company where they make low carbon concrete ultimately. And so one process in which they do that instead of curing with water they cure with CO2. And it turns out that if you add oxalic acid in that process you enhance the uptake of CO2 through the curing process. And so really it's it's like you know that acid allows the magnesium atoms in your feedstock if it's a mineralization approach to be more reactive to CO2 and to help bind it but it's towards a permanent product not necessarily like like you wouldn't use it as a a fuel you would use it as a part of an enhancement process for mineralizing CO2.

At least based on my understanding of the ways in which we can convert CO2, I know there's a huge push towards electrochemistry because there is that's one sustainable way of leveraging solar and wind to convert to electricity and then use that towards reducing CO2. One of the things that is kind of less explored at least based on my understanding is using light directly. So one of the things that you can achieve with light which is difficult to achieve in an electrochemical process is the one electron reduction of CO2. When you talk about electrochemistry you're talking about two or more electron reduction of CO2 right because one electron has a very very high over potential associated with it. So those kind of reductions can be achieved using photo redox chemistry. So essentially using light to drive a photo redox catalyst to become an anion and that anion can push one electron towards CO2. And as far as I understand it there are operational issues associated with it which is why as of right now it's mostly focused on highly specific applications. It could either be things like adding COOH groups to aromatics so basically carboxylate styrene and make a polymer precursor. Attach a carboxylic acid to an amine and make an amino acid which can go into pharmaceuticals. So there are a lot of specialized applications that we can think of. The challenge of course being making sure that these catalysts are cyclable and coming up with continuous processes. But at least there are lab scale continuous processes that exist now that leverage these light assisted pathways. So I think we can do more difficult chemistry as well beyond what is shown with electrocatalysis and we can think beyond formic acid right because you can use any kind of substrate and link a carboxylate group to it.

So aquaponics is hydroponically grown plants aquaculture no soil you cycle nutrients lower environmental impacts. And they're actually using carbon dioxide that's not waste carbon dioxide and pumping it into their greenhouse right now to bring up their yields. So I was thinking a little bit more about the distributed systems that you could do as we seek to feed more of the world that you know if we are increasing aquaponics which it seems like we are you know what are some unconventional places we haven't thought as much about using CO2 because we think they're niche right now but they might not end up being.
