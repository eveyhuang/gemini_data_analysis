Right? So it probably makes more sense to make jet fuel from the CO2 from the flue stack rather than directly from the atmosphere if you're competing head to head. So I'm just wondering unless there is a synergism that okay, something about capture from air than than couples with something that cannot be done with the flue gas. So actually actually maybe then another story I can tell is that one of the challenges with flue gas is that often it's not pure. Right? So often has some impurities. And so maybe that CO2 capture from from air will be cleaner. So then maybe there's a process that requires a cleaner CO2 and then that's how you you you avoid having to purify flue gas. You'd then capture it directly from from air if if that makes economic sense.",

We could talk about from amines. I mean, maybe just keep that in mind, right? And so if we I mean, that's related to what I believe Rafael was saying. But if we capture in form of carbonates, then we would have in principle a concentrated form of carbon available, even though, you know, it takes some time to concentrate it up in the first place.

There's some examples, lots of ways to get hydrogen, electrochemical, but also like biomass waste gasification. But mostly just kind of pulling from the group and your background and and skill sets and and you know, young minds just entering this field that excited to have an impact. And so maybe thinking about just like the basic skill sets that you have and how would you think about combining things? You know, whether it's CO2 into a carbonate that could be used as a feedstock for synthetic aggregate for concrete and construction or whether the CO2 is a feedstock to be combined with hydrogen for methanol, maybe because it's hard to transport hydrogen, but easier to transport methanol. You know, maybe the CO2 is avoided from a power plant and that's cheaper and easier. But ultimately, you don't get any removal benefit from that. That's only avoiding the emissions to the atmosphere. So I mean, just just thinking openly, you know, about what your skill sets are here, your background, how it could collectively be combined in a collaborative way to think of a proposal idea that we're kind of be super exciting and game-changing and and just thinking about some of these challenges. The fact that, you know, I really like what Julia also said is like jet fuel is an issue. And if we can figure out how to make it in a synthetic way, then you know, not only are we doing something with that CO2 in terms of a waste management path, but we're also, you know, removing ourselves from our dependence on crude oil in the earth too. So it has that co-benefit. But all of these these topics of what to do with CO2, whether it's a feedstock to a chemical or a fuel or whether it's a carbonate, I think it's just meant to be, you know, brainstorming an idea that collectively you might be able to combine skill sets to have a unique proposal idea, you know, ultimately.",

How what could what should you be combining so that you can make an electro platform economical long term? So that's that's my area. In a past life, I did work in the bioelectrochemical space, looking at like how can we and we did some work on looking at bacteria-based bioelectrochemical conversion.

I don't know if that's the best place to get hydrogen from, but I think about that a lot.
