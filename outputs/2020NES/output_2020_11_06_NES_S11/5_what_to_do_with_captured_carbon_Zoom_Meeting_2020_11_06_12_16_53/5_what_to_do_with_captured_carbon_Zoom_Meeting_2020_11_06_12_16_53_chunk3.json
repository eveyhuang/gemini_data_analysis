Because the chemical industry if you look at the market for formic acid it's really small okay. The market price is pretty high but the market size is too small. It's not even close to the CO2 size not orders of magnitude away. So if you think of formic acid coupling with the one you just mentioned a formic acid fuel cell we think formic acid as a fuel rather than a chemical. So there's a significant difference here. We think this as a waste for energy storage rather than for chemical production. Then you will get to a much larger scale. I think that's the way to go to store energy in the chemical bonds with some some kind of chemicals like formic acid is relatively easy to store rather than think about hydrogen has this headache you know storage is always a challenge there or transportation is always a challenge there. I think formic acid could be a unique one to play an important role for chemical for energy storage. That's sort of",

And so I don't know like you know what's the like should I put it in the slide or are we how are we feeling about this?",

            "transcript": "To to Julia's point actually about about finding large scale applications for CO2. I think we can do several small scale applications if we think big enough right? There's a wealth of literature on organic synthesis where you can think of CO2 as a feedstock for carboxylation reactions of anything to produce anything from specialty chemicals to pharmaceutical ingredients. And there's a mix of pathways to be able to do that either using like any synthetic organic chemistry or or photoredox pathways where you have these nice organic or inorganic photoredox catalysts that either in their excited states or in some sort of anion radical states can reduce CO2 and and help carboxylate things like styrene carboxylation amino acid formation. So I think there are a lot of little niche applications that we can come up with based on on the chemical knowledge that we already have. And are there some really interesting science challenges that would make those reaction could make those reactions much more efficient or less energy intensive or are there some that would help scale them commercially and make them cost effective?",

I think even at you know concept level at a lab scale level we have to identify catalysts you know with you know long lifetime before we can consider for scale up and even to do additional economic analysis.

            "transcript": "So the the reason I brought up is because if you think about compare two approach you know electrocatalysis versus battery energy storage. If you look at the battery publication they can go up to you know several months test. And how can you know even at lab scale if you can demonstrate you know reliable catalyst for you know hundreds of hours it will make you know industry adoption more optimistic and realistic for them to get involved. If you only do you know 10 hours test you know 24 hours test I'm not sure industry will be really interested to get into the the business. So that's that's the reason I brought this out. Because eventually so no matter you do negative emission or you know CO2 neutral conversion so you want something end up with possibility for scale up. So anyway that's my that's my two cents. Okay.",

So at the moment so we want to do ideally we want to do water oxidation right. So we are still needing very good low cost water oxidation catalyst electrocatalyst instead of platinum or some other expensive metals. So I think that's a bottleneck.

So you could take your direct air capture there unit there capture CO2 and then inject it into the mining tailings to then do mineral carbonation of the mining tailings right so this is a well accepted idea many people in Canada Australia and so on work on this but they usually assume that they're getting the CO2 directly from the air but if we can capture the CO2 and concentrate it then we're going to be weathering those tailings a lot faster and maybe even more than just by by waiting for the the air to do it so that would be a large scale potential application.",

No I was just going to say there's a couple of companies that like Prometheus is one and another one is Opus 12 and then there's also planetary hydrogen. So these are commercial not not commercial but these are companies you know like Opus 12 was out of the cyclotron road started out of there they're doing pretty well. But these are you know they've they've kind of changed their business model over the years but for the most part looking at low cost electricity in the United States like where could that be sourced and low cost CO2. So originally thinking about direct air capture just because of the flexibility of the siting as Raphael is pointing out but just because it's so high cost you know it's a matter of okay maybe we start with point source capture.",
