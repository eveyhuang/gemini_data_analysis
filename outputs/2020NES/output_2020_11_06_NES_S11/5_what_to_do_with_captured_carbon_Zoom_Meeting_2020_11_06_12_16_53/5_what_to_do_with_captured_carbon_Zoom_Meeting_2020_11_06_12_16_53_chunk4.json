            "transcript": "because one of the I've from communicating with those groups and knowing their technologies a little bit, one of the issues is the starting concentration of CO2 and how that impacts the conversion efficiency to the chemicals or the fuels. In the case of Opus 12, they're in a business model that's really focused on actually just making syngas just for flexibility and being able to make different maybe it's oxalic acid that they want to make or maybe it's you know, even you know synthetic methane for instance. But lots of flexibility based upon their approach depending on the catalyst that they're using. But one of the questions is like you know what is the essential CO2 concentration going into your process and how does that impact the conversion efficiency which and then from a chemical engineering perspective, how does that impact the size of the reactor and then obviously the capex of the system because how low can you go in terms of CO2 concentration as a feedstock? That that that could be a tunable parameter that could could impact costs and I don't know if that you guys have given any thought to that.",

And so but obviously there's you know there's probably some like optimal trade-off between the need the energy requirements to concentrate and so balancing the energy energy to concentrate requirements and the basically the mass transport requirements would be something that I'm sure they've that that would be interesting to see that analysis but but I'm my guess is there's an optimum.",

Like how does that impact the conversion efficiency of your process you know whether it's probably not having to do with the actual reaction kinetics but more the diffusion kinetics like what you're saying Marta. But I think that that you know we often work in our silos and what we're trying to do here is like break those walls down and and get us working you know across those sectors.",

But I mean there's also like nice moffs I mean oxygen is one of the easiest ones because well it's a good oxidant. And you know if you oxidize something we can reduce it back using solar. I mean so that's why oxygen yeah I'm just saying it's an additional thing. I think like low low concentrations of feed is okay but purity is important, right?",

            "transcript": "So one of the mechanisms and I don't know Raphael I heard you might work in mineralization. So one of the things that it's known to be able to do is help to bring the magnesium out of you know so if you have a a mine tailing waste and it's got magnesium in it often times the magnesium isn't necessarily reactive because it's bound in a silica structure and it's very difficult to get it out. But when you add oxalate or or oxalic acid to the solution it actually helps to dissolve the magnesium and make it reactive for crystallization and mineralization with CO2. And so one of the things like the Opus 12 was looking at is working with a company called Solidia and so very different but looking at Solidia's process I don't know if you guys know Solidia is a company where they make low carbon concrete ultimately. And so one process in which they do that instead of curing with water they cure with CO2. And it turns out that if you add oxalic acid in that process you enhance the uptake of CO2 through the curing process. And so really it's it's like you know that acid allows the magnesium atoms in your feedstock if it's a mineralization approach to be more reactive to CO2 and to help bind it but it's towards a permanent product not necessarily like like you wouldn't use it as a a fuel you would use it as a part of an enhancement process for mineralizing CO2. So that's how I see it",
