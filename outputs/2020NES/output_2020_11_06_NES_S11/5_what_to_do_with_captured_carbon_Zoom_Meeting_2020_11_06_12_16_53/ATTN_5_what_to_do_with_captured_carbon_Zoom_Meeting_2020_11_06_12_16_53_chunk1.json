      "transcript": "Well the only thing I was going to say about that is just again because we always should compare the CO2 capture from the atmosphere versus CO2 capture from a flue gas stack. Right so it probably makes more sense to make jet fuel from the CO2 from the flue stack rather than directly from the atmosphere if you're competing head to head. So I'm just wondering unless there is a synergism that okay something about capture from air then then couples with something that cannot be done with a flue gas. So actually actually maybe then another story I can tell is that one of the challenges with flue gas is that often it's not pure right so often has some some impurities and so maybe that CO2 capture from from air will be cleaner so then maybe there's a process that requires a cleaner CO2 and then that's how you you you avoid having to purify flue gas. You then capture it directly from from air if if that makes economic sense.",

So maybe it makes sense to think about it you know in more separate ways.",

So jet fuel there was some argument about where do we get hydrogen from so now we're talking about basically components for thermal catalyzed reactions. So we're not talking about electrochemical approaches to um carbon carbon uh like catenation basically.",

      "transcript": "Yeah I mean ultimately we just want to have an open discussion and brainstorm about any approaches. Those are some examples. Lots of ways to get hydrogen you know electrochemical but also like biomass waste gasification. Um but mostly just kind of pulling from the group and your background and and skill sets and and um your you know young minds just entering this field that are excited to have an impact. And so maybe thinking about just like the basic skill sets that you have and how would you think about combining things you know whether it's CO2 into a carbonate that could be used as a feedstock for synthetic aggregate for concrete and construction or whether the CO2 is a feedstock to be combined with hydrogen for methanol maybe because it's hard to transport hydrogen but easier to transport methanol. Um you know maybe the CO2 is avoided from a power plant and that's cheaper and easier um but ultimately you don't get any removal benefit from that that's only avoiding the emissions to the atmosphere. So I I mean just just thinking openly you know about what your skill sets are here your background how it could collectively be uh combined in a collaborative way to think of a proposal idea um that would kind of be super exciting and game-changing and um and and just thinking about some of these challenges the fact that you know I really like what Julia also said is like jet fuel is an issue and if we can figure out how to make it in a synthetic way then you know not only are we doing something with that CO2 in terms of a waste management path but we're also you know removing ourselves from our dependence on crude oil in the earth too so it has that co-benefit. Um but all of these these topics of what to do with CO2 whether it's a feedstock to a chemical or a fuel or whether it's a carbonate um I think it's just meant to be you know brainstorming an idea that collectively you might be able to combine skill sets to have a unique um proposal idea you know ultimately. So maybe we can hear from some other folks Rafael and and Michael have said some things but what about",

But those microalgae that you just mentioned actually eat carbonates and so there's like some interesting conversions of you know where carbonates are an issue for electrocatalysis but they're great for the microalgae what can the microalgae do with that um even just atmospheric CO2.",

We do some catalysis um but we also do a lot of um analysis of you know system mass transport um and those effects. Um and so we're from my perspective I'm always interested interested in like where should the CO2 be used should it be you know looking at anode reactions or cathode reactions um how what what should you be combining so that you can make an economical um because maybe you need to be making co you need to have co-products um to make an electrochemical platform economical long term. Um so that's that's my area. Um in a past life I did work in the bioelectrochemical uh space looking at like how can we and we did some work on looking at um you know bacteria-based uh bioelectrochemical conversion um and in those ways you can kind of look at mineralization based reactions um but um and that was also for simultaneous like wastewater treatment processes um but yeah that's that's my space.",
