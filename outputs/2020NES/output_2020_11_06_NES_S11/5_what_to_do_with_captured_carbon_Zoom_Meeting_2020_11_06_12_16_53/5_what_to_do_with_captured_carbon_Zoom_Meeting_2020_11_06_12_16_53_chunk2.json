I think the technology itself is more or less there and it's just the cost issue right. So I think the cost you can think a different way. If you don't put any any cost to CO2 emission of course you will say yeah that hydrogen from water electrolysis is just too expensive. But if you think differently say CO2 emission actually has a a cost right to the environment and someone else need to pay for it okay it's not free. So if you take that into account I think what electrolysis is the way to go. You can do biomass um to take out hydrogen. I think this could be short term kind of route to do to consider but in a long term um if you think about it once you take the hydrogen out you end with CO2. How are you dealing with those things?",

Right so your power plant is not mobile your power plant is fixed in a place but your direct air capture could go from place to place capturing CO2 and then using it for something. So if you can then link the capture to something which is location specific but has to be moved around. So that's why I initially came up with this idea of a small small geological storage that you know you sequester a little bit here then you move on and you sequester somewhere else and you move on and you sequester somewhere else. So there's ability to move the direct air capture is one of the big advantages versus your standard flue gas capture.",

So it's interesting how the economics can impact things you know the value of what that product is that you want to get in the end that's offsetting the capture costs.",
