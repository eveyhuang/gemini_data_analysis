So your power plant is not mobile. Your power plant is fixed in a place, but your direct air capture could go from place to place capturing CO2 and then using it for something. So if you can then link the capture to something which is location specific but has to be moved around. So that's why initially I came up with this idea of a small small geological storage that you know, you sequester a little bit here, then you move on and you sequester somewhere else and you move on and you sequester somewhere else. So this ability to move the direct air capture is one of the big advantages versus your standard flue gas capture.",
