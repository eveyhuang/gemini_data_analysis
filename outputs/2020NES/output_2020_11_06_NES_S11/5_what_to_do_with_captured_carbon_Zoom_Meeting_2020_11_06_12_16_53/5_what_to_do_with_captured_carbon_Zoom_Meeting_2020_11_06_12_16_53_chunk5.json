            "transcript": "Sorry. Yeah. At least based on my understanding of the ways in which we can convert CO2, I know there's a huge push towards electrochemistry because there is that's one sustainable way of leveraging solar and wind to convert to electricity and then use that towards reducing CO2. One of the things that is kind of less explored at least based on my understanding is using light directly. So one of the things that you can achieve with light which is difficult to achieve in an electrochemical process is the one electron reduction of CO2. When you talk about electrochemistry you're talking about two or more electron reduction of CO2 right because one electron has a very very high over potential associated with it. So those kind of reductions can be achieved using photo redox chemistry. So essentially using light to drive a photo redox catalyst to become an anion and that anion can push one electron towards CO2. And as far as I understand it there are operational issues associated with it which is why as of right now it's mostly focused on highly specific applications. It could either be things like adding COOH groups to aromatics so basically carboxylate styrene and make a polymer precursor. Attach a carboxylic acid to an amine and make an amino acid which can go into pharmaceuticals. So there are a lot of specialized applications that we can think of. The challenge of course being making sure that these catalysts are cyclable and coming up with continuous processes. But at least there are lab scale continuous processes that exist now that leverage these light assisted pathways. So I think we can do more difficult chemistry as well beyond what is shown with electrocatalysis and we can think beyond formic acid right because you can use any kind of substrate and link a carboxylate group to it.",

            "transcript": "Yeah so one of the issues that that I see with some of the catalysts that we look at is the cyclability. Because you're using light in addition to doing the photo redox chemistry these molecules tend to degrade rather rapidly. So you get five turnovers and everything dies out. And this is and the issues are I think kind of common between the materials used for catalysis and the materials we use for organic LEDs for example. So I think there is a lot of opportunity in trying to identify what those degradation pathways are and finding ways to mitigate them and that has applications across all kinds of light all kinds of photonic materials not just photo redox chemistry.",

            "transcript": "So some of my background's in sustainability. So it's a slightly different take. I mean the one thing I think about whenever we talk about steps is that every step or raw material or energy or electricity consumption adds environmental impact as does transportation. So it's just being careful that you know although a process may be easy and feasible at some point it actually won't be better from a carbon standpoint depending on what you use. And that's just one thing to think about that I was thinking about as people were talking. You know and one other thing that struck me Julia I think way at the beginning you talked about growing plants with carbon dioxide and it actually reminded me so we work with in my other research hats with an aquaponics producer. So aquaponics is hydroponically grown plants aquaculture no soil you cycle nutrients lower environmental impacts. And they're actually using carbon dioxide that's not waste carbon dioxide and pumping it into their greenhouse right now to bring up their yields. So I was thinking a little bit more about the distributed systems that you could do as we seek to feed more of the world that you know if we are increasing aquaponics which it seems like we are you know what are some unconventional places we haven't thought as much about using CO2 because we think they're niche right now but they might not end up being. I think we've got one of the bigger ones in the country that's doing I think almost 200,000 pounds of fish a year and fills up at least like a truck a day like one of those big delivery trucks a day of greens. But that's my two cents.",

But from a slightly different angle we're trying to feed the plants with some carbon species rather than let the leaf doing the photosynthesis and take it down. So we actually doing both and and we have some very interesting result. The plant some of the plants actually can grow in some of the chemicals you can produce from electrochemical process. I think in the field there are a lot of people looking to say formate for example or or different chemicals and feed them to bacteria and they can actually grow. This is one of the areas actually I think kind of interesting and I think there's some new opportunities there.",
