And then you want to translate that information to some heterogeneous material. And there's the other extreme, um, that you end up studying just perfect surfaces that are well-defined crystals, um, no defect sites where catalysis, uh, are typically occurring. And so where do you find that sort of, uh, intermediate of of addressing things like you're pointing out, the environment, uh, pH, heterogeneous architectures, the presence of defect sites. And it's not clear to me that we're there at an experimental level or a theory level as a community, but, but that's something we're striving for. And, you know, Carlos brings up the point of how fast do we move towards something like that versus, uh, be critical and hesitant to make those leaps and extensions in our ability to model and our ability, uh, to measure. And those those are tough questions to address. I I'm not sure. ",

One of the simplest I mean, so when we are trying to model some, for example, a defect interaction with a diffusing species, it's still a challenge to capture what really happens in experiment, uh, when we do this in a continuum level where again simplifying it, right? So, for example, you have a range of defects with complex topologies with couple multiple, you know, multiple physics that interplay in that local in that locality. And at the end of the day, we're trying to model the very simplest idealized version of this defect and then trying to understand how this affects certain fundamental if it's the diffusion kinetics we're thinking of, how does that change in the presence of a defect? But I think although it's kind of simple, I still do think, uh, introducing a small seed of that heterogeneity gives us a lot of knowledge and understanding what perhaps happens in a complex system, but it's uh, but it it is challenging it is it is a challenge to implement that in a computational framework. And the simplest one is to sort of idealize idealize that heterogeneity, I think. ",
