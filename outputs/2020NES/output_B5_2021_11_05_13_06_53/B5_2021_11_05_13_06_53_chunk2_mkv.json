            "transcript": "So, I wanted to start maybe by by pointing out that maybe this is actually a challenge that many times it's sort of two different silos. And then it turns out that I think people that do theory trust that people that do experiments do the experiments in a controlled manner and that we have a good understanding of the types of reactors that we use. And if you actually ask experimentally, very likely they have very little understanding of what is the mass transport inside of those sort of systems and how that couples to kinetics. And then so you're essentially left trying to justify some experimental observations when the experimental observations and are really deviated from from it's affected simply by the geometry of the reactor. So that's where this I'm interested in this multiscale modeling, right? I would like to to see theory that is I read papers and sometimes they they have a big component of theory, but I do not really learn a lot because it matches the results and you say yes, this will explain them, right? And I think every time that I see thermodynamics, I'm okay with the calculations. When I see the use of DFT to do kinetics, that's when I start to see a lot of red flags because many times I think we don't even understand the reactors are where used. So, I don't know if that contributes to the discussion, but",

So being able to compare apples to apples or pairs to pairs or whatever you want to call between experiment and theory is crucial because there will always be errors both in experiments and in theory. I mean, like this is not like we're doing science, but nothing is really the absolute truth in the end because we're continuing and it's changing over time, right? So at each point, we just need to ask ourselves, are we comparing the same things, right? And what what is needed in a model or in an experiment? What is in the experiment that the model needs to actually take into account, right? And that's not always clear, and we always oversimplify, right? So how do you, as you ask, how do you bridge the gaps between these two communities to actually be able to do appropriate comparisons. I if that if that's my interpretation of what you is that correct?",

In reality, these are adiabatic systems. So it if we also work a lot on the characterization of heat transfer in these systems, right? So how what is the flux? Because assumption is, yeah, is in equilibrium with the outside, with the room where you're doing the experiment. But in reality, if you look at the thickness of the walls of the reactor, that's not the case. It's closer to an adiabatic system. And then if it's an adiabatic system, you have the energy needs to come from somewhere, right? So the over potential perhaps is doing that in in many of the electrochemical transformations. So how do you how can we work with theory? I think theorists should also be more critical of people that do experiments and push them to actually",

So Gary and I were actually in a previous session where kind of the same type of general topic was brought up, like actually just being on the same page of what we're comparing, I think, is crucial. What is the actual overall goal that we're trying to achieve? So I know that there are a number of individuals here that do very different type of modeling at very different length scales. I mean, like we have I'm just going to call some people, right? We have Rebecca, who's really at the quantum scale. She's dealing with excitations and, you know, all that. And then we have, what should I call it, at the top of my head? Anya, you were talking about, you know, really a very different length and time scales, right? So could you comment on some of the things that Carlos just mentioned here? Like, how do you think we should address this?",
