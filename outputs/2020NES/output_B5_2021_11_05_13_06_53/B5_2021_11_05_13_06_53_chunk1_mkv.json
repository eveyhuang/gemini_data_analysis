We're also interested in understanding the kinetics of some of the microstructural evolution and how this affects how a material responds to an external stimuli. And in the context of this conference, we are interested to sort of develop continuum scale models to understand the fundamentals of absorption process, competing diffusion mechanisms, and how this affects material properties that are used for absorption and storage.",
