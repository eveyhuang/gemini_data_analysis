            "transcript": "I think one of the ways in which, like, at least the computational community can police itself in terms of whether we are predicting the properties correctly or not. Not necessarily accurately, but whether we are capturing the physics right or not, uh, is essentially by not worrying about the physical quantity as such, but, but to see if trends match what you see in experiment or what you believe to be correct through intuition, right? So if I, like, if I'm looking at a molecular system, for example, if I tweak the electrophilicity of one particular group at one end, I have some intuition about how that would impact the resulting kinetics. So to a certain extent, we can give meaningful results even though the underlying method does not capture, let's say, for example, charge transfer states.",

I can model something, but I don't have an exact number to compare it to. But look, like you're saying, intuitively, or just, you know, known known quantities that increases when we expect it to increase. That's not always kind of good enough when when you talk to the community, I find. So I agree with you, but it runs up against the limit. And the one thing I kind of hear was talking about here is, you know, basically the idea of VVUCQ, right? Verification, validation, and certain quantification. And we started out with this conversation of propagating it. Um, I feel like that's although I don't think it's easy. I think there's so many challenges to it. Like that's what what I've experimentalists often want to see to know that back to what we were saying before, we're only modeling what we can, but we're modeling reality, or as close as we can to reality.",

I think when when at least when I understand or when I look at homogeneous catalyst, I think, uh, you you guys are in a much better position than in in heterogeneous surfaces, right? And I think the danger is sometimes we extrapolate too quick and say, well, this works well here, so this method also should work here. And then, uh, then that's not really the case, right? Um, so finding trends on on homogeneous catalyst, I think is is great. Trying to define trends on on heterogeneous surfaces, I think is much more challenging. And I think, uh, extrapolate too fast, I think.",

So, um, it might simplify if you know where to look for it, but that's um so the other thing that just building off of what you just said, Valentina, now is, you know, we've we've kind of so far just focused very much about, you know, the explosive potential chemistry that might happen at a molecule or a material or a substrate or whatever you you want to use. Um, how do we then go ahead and actually model the role of the environment, which is kind of the other typical thing that's, you know, especially in these complex chemistries, um, how do we how do we actually go ahead and include that? Do you mean environment, I mean climate? I mean environment larger systems. The actual systems. Yes, I should specify. I mean, if we're looking at the electrochemical cell, like Carlos was talking about, right? The environment of that material is actually an explicit solvent somehow with ions and stuff like that. That's what I mean by the micro environment of of the at that interface where the actual chemistry is taking place, right? Um, yeah, that was a You mean the thing about too, we could also talk about climate. Of course, of course. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, my my my bad on the on the language there. So, you know, how important is it that we have the things at the atomic scale, at the quantum scale, at the non-equilibrium scale? What does that mean? How explicit do we have to be for us to, and then at the end, be able to predict what the, you know, what the overall performance would be at the nanometer scale or micrometer scale or whatever you want.",

And then you want to translate that information to some heterogeneous material. And there's the other extreme, um, that you end up studying just perfect surfaces that are well-defined crystals, um, no defect sites where catalysis, uh, are typically occurring. And so where do you find that sort of, uh, intermediate of of addressing things like you're pointing out, the environment, uh, pH, heterogeneous architectures, the presence of defect sites. And it's not clear to me that we're there at an experimental level or a theory level as a community, but, but that's something we're striving for. And, you know, Carlos brings up the point of how fast do we move towards something like that versus, uh, be critical and hesitant to make those leaps and extensions in our ability to model and our ability, uh, to measure. And those those are tough questions to address. I I'm not sure.",

One of the simplest I mean, so when we are trying to model some, for example, a defect interaction with a diffusing species, it's still a challenge to capture what really happens in experiment, uh, when we do this in a continuum level where again simplifying it, right? So, for example, you have a range of defects with complex topologies with couple multiple, you know, multiple physics that interplay in that local in that locality. And at the end of the day, we're trying to model the very simplest idealized version of this defect and then trying to understand how this affects certain fundamental if it's the diffusion kinetics we're thinking of, how does that change in the presence of a defect? But I think although it's kind of simple, I still do think, uh, introducing a small seed of that heterogeneity gives us a lot of knowledge and understanding what perhaps happens in a complex system, but it's uh, but it it is challenging it is it is a challenge to implement that in a computational framework. And the simplest one is to sort of idealize idealize that heterogeneity, I think.",
