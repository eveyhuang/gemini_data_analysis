There are many other things you can do because inside buildings has a lot higher concentration of CO2 than outside. We are point sources of CO2. In your room, much higher than 410 ppm, right? So people are looking into this. But the reason historically that was developed kind of a rural area or not urban setting is because one of the benefit of DAC is that you can co-locate CO2 storage site with the CO2 capture site so that you can eliminate the transportation between, right? So there's a huge saving of that. So let's say if you have a place for injection of CO2 which is usually not in the city, this is where you want to build. Like Iceland, middle of nowhere.

I'm sure you're thinking about it. Until now, when you develop CO2 capture materials, regardless point source or DAC, you have to put energy in. So binding energy pulling it down, you have to re-put energy back in, that's the regeneration part. And that's where you're going to get that energy is very critical for your net carbon sink as well as energy penalty and all that. Usually if you're near power producer, you use waste heat because temperature is about 120 to 140 degrees C, it's not hugely high. That's how they got a lot of credit. They're saying, oh it's free to come along, right? But if you're middle of nowhere, now you have to burn something or create that heat to do that. So that's why all the discussion Kristen is talking about. But at the same time, should we really use heat to regenerate? That's a new question a lot of people are asking. So until now to provide energy, they're doing either temperature swing or pressure swing or combination. But can we use microwave? Can we use plasma? Can we use radio frequency? There only thing you have to do is to deliver the energy to which is binding onto CO2, that's a material question. Can that be non-thermal? That's a huge question in there. That's one thing a lot of research is going in that direction. Second, the Gary's question. Right now economically the best thing to do is enhanced oil recovery because there is a market for it for sure. There is a 45Q, I don't know whether you're familiar with, there's a tax credit if you utilize CO2 or store. So there's a lot of market created. But is it really giving you net CO2 benefit? That's a huge debate. We kind of heard that, right, from Julia a little bit. So right now CO2 storage is challenged because US government kind of stopped working on it for a while. So we'll see what happens in a few days. But regardless, eventually storage will come back. If you care about climate change, you have to store. But right now we don't have a lot of demonstration project yet. Utilization is interesting because you can start with the niche areas with tax credit. So I think a lot of companies are coming up. One of the big thing in utilization is the cement production and that is economical today.",

I was just again given the energy intensive nature of DAC already, what what are your thoughts on utilization of CO2 coming from DAC systems?",

You can shut down everything and today is a zero emission, I agree with you.
