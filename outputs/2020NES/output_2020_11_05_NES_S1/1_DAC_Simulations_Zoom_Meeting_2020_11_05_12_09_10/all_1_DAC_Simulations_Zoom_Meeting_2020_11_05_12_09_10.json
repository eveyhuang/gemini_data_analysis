There are many other things you can do because inside buildings has a lot higher concentration of CO2 than outside. We are point sources of CO2. In your room, much higher than 410 ppm, right? So people are looking into this. But the reason historically DAC was developed kind of a rural area or non-urban setting is because one of the benefit of DAC is that you can co-locate CO2 storage site with the CO2 capture site so that you can eliminate the transportation between, right? So there's a huge saving of that. So let's say if you have a place for injection of CO2, which is usually not in the city, this is where you want to build, like Iceland, middle of nowhere.

So that's why all the discussion Kristen is talking about. But at the same time, should we really use heat to regenerate? That's a new question a lot of people are asking. So until now, to provide energy, they're doing either temperature swing or pressure swing or combination. But can we use microwave? Can we use plasma? Can we use radio frequency? There, only thing you have to do is deliver the energy to which is binding onto CO2. That's a material question. Can that be non-thermal? That's a huge question in there.

So of course, CO2 is a molecule that's at the bottom of the thermodynamic spectrum, right? And converting it into a useful chemical means you input a certain amount of energy and that has a certain carbon cost, if you will, associated with it, right? So in terms of CO2 conversion to value added chemicals, are there chemicals and or processes where you think the possibility of a net reduction in CO2 while accounting for the necessary energy input exists and what are those chemicals in your estimation?",

Like if we made all our plastic out of CO2, it might account for a couple percent of the CO2 we need to capture. So sequestration is a big part of it as you said. I think something that people haven't thought about in this area though is so you can make valuable chemicals, but you could also make chemicals that are easier to sequester than CO2 itself, which we have a limited capacity for. And I don't think that's really been explored at all. So can you with less energy make something that's much easier to dispose of or be sequestered for a longer period of time than CO2 itself in a super critical state.",
