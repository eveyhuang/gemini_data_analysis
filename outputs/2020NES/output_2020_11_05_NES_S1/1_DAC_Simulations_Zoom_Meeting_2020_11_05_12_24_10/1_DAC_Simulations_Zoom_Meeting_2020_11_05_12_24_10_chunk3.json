We shouldn't do one technology fits all because if you're doing direct air capture again power plant I built in New York versus Beijing can be exactly the same. But direct air capture in Beijing versus New York would be very different. Just because we have different environment, right? So something to think about. Either they have to be different system or they have to be operated differently.",

I'm looking at the the PowerPoint slide that you guys are developing. I was wondering if we can somehow we could change it to I mean modify it a little bit. For example the parts that you how do you place DAC in the field oh not not that part. Concentration issue. I think it's better to replace it with thermodynamic limitation right? Because I think the the DAC problem is the thermodynamic right? It's a it's a thermodynamically limited problem right? We know that the mass flux is an issue. So I guess it's better to change it change it to thermodynamic limitation.",

Understanding how let's say different companies' technologies would be affected differently in different locations depends on data right? Knowing what they were doing. And I heard somebody saying earlier that nobody's really putting out data on how these kind of demonstration plants are working. I mean is that true? Is the data limited in terms of understanding how well they're doing and any of the local details of CO2 capture?",

So that some companies including Climeworks claim that they can make clean water while doing CO2 capture. So what is the impact of drying up your air at the same time of removing CO2? That's another question we should ask, right?",

Where to place it how to place it. But because none of us are expert in simulation we can almost think that DAC is like a black box and then they can assume like this black box captures 60% of CO2 at the rate of whatever then they can do it becomes more atmospheric modeling. But none of you are in that area. So how about this? If I ask you right? The whole point of this event is that first of all all you guys are rising stars in your field.",
