If you think of all the work that's gone into siting wind farms, like using the analogy, there are a lot of comparables but wind farms don't care usually about the humidity. And I think Rob was saying can you get these things mobile. Wind farms it's pretty easy to change the pitch with the wind, that's not the same as taking the whole thing and shifting it from one location to another.",

Yes, because that would be a direct capture or in soil. It's less engineering and more maybe natural science but I think it's one of the thing that people are thinking to conserve more to actually increase the area of wetlands.",

      "transcript": "So Valentina brings an important question because what basically she's saying is there's a natural sink for CO2. What if you remove the lower the CO2 concentration around these natural sinks? Wetlands, ocean. Because at the end of the day this whole technology of CCUS is being developed to lower the CO2 concentration in atmosphere, right? So then by reducing the local concentration of CO2 would it impact too much? So that in net we are not doing anything good because some positive some negative it wash out. That's what people worrying about, right? So what are the important scientific questions should we ask in that area then? The location, how far they are, integration of them into renewable energy grid. There are a lot of questions, right? Or more data in certain areas. I think these are the things you can start thinking about.",

      "transcript": "I think that's one of the most questions that I'm personally most interested in is I work on modeling wind power and renewable energy forecasting and we did a base analysis of what happens when where would you site DAC if you had to use just variable renewable power. But one of the questions and we looked at the California grid and just based on economics you can you would choose DAC over alkaline electrolysis. But one of the two open questions that we still have is what are the real costs of these systems and why because they're still being developed we don't we have no idea. And what are the real process models? So we we don't we have an idea of how they could ramp up and down with with the variability of renewable power but how does that affect the process, the ramping and the the rest of it and degradation, yeah. Good point.",

It doesn't need to be directly on atmospheric model simulations since none of us are experts in that area apparently. But any thoughts on DAC and in the field basically.",

      "transcript": "I might have a really dumb question. Hopefully you guys don't mind. So I'm curious about when you do the DAC and I would imagine as you mentioned that we are going to pull air and then trying to remove CO2 apparently. This is something I don't understand is that so do we know how fast CO2 that can diffuse to replenish the the concentration? I right now I don't have that idea about how fast they will be able to I mean if you have 400 ppm after you remove the local environment might become 200 ppm. So so such an equilibration might be so important because there are some amine adsorbents and they all rely on this kind of step change. They will change to a really high uptake all of a sudden like after 300 ppm and they are not going to work before I mean when you have a concentration less than 300 ppm. So this is just a question in my mind about how fast the CO2 they will diffuse in the in the environment in the local environment. Just some a question I have. This is something I'm thinking about. This might be really dumb but I just want to ask.",

And I mean locally I mean there's a 200 ppm so but my question is that how do we know how how fast the CO2 they will just diffuse to the site we are capturing because that would really influence the local you know the local concentration. I don't know I just don't have any idea about how this diffusion time scale and length scale will be. Just something.",

So you have something sitting on a rooftop or whatever and you're sucking CO2 in somehow you've got so much air coming around. I I don't think that's probably not going to be the rate limiting step.",
