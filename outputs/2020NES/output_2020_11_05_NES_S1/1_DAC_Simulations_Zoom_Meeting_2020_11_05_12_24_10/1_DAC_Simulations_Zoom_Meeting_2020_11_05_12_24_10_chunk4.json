That's really vision statement for fundamental statement so it will be very important for you guys to look at it if you're in the area CCUS overall. The other one is report Chris Jones and others led is the National Academies report on negative emission technologies. Both are very important report for you guys to read because both of them are in the level of fundamental understanding. There are reports like National Petroleum Council which I was involved in same as Mission Innovation. That one is more like a road map. So if you get a lot of funding from DOE you want to read that one too because it's more submitted to DOE as a road map for near term long term implication of CCUS but the other two article is like a vision statement. What is the fundamental science we need to develop for carbon management for next few decades at minimum. So those I can put into chat later on or share with you guys I will share with everybody. Those are important reports to read.",

            "transcript": "You mean after capturing CO2? I think this is a very good question and it's a very difficult question right? It's just again you have to consider the flux of of your DAC system right? Well we know that we're going to concentrate CO2 from from PPM level to let's say one to two or 5% CO2 right? But what is the throughput of this system right? In other words is it enough to to use it for methanol for example conversion production through FT process right? How much energy input you need? I mean it goes back to the to the again throughput of your first first unit. Is it going to well also I think it's one of the things that we work is just again coupling point source CO2 capture and oxidative dehydrogenation reaction where you you can convert CO2 let's say to olefins right light olefins using for example ethane or ethylene as the as a co-reactant but that's the question that in fact I have from myself is it really viable to do the same thing with DAC itself not with with point source CO2 because these are fundamentally different though we're talking we're actually considering the same same process but again considering the the engineering aspect of the system I think this is very hard to come up with the with the flow rate right or the or the process requirements that you need to to have to to couple these two. So it's very hard to answer. I think doesn't really matter because you do have CO2 right? It could you can easily you can react it with hydrogen right and hydrogenation of CO2 make it to methanol make it to higher hydrocarbons right or you know other things but I think it's just it's very difficult question to answer it goes back to the to the again to the life cycle analysis first we need to do how much energy input right all of this then we have to then say okay this is the best way but I mean from now I think it's very difficult to you know come up with the right at least in my opinion to right answer for that.",

So by including quaternary amines can you make more passive approaches for DAC that are then directly interfaced with electrocatalytic materials for for producing perhaps a range of chemicals. You know if you wanted to keep it simple for for developing that up front chemistry then doing things like CO and hydrogen is is one possible route and then you could imagine using those to tap into existing things like Fischer-Tropsch reactions for building up other products from that flue gas mixture. So those are are some ideas that we've been interested in but",
