So these are the questions when you try to use The main question we are asked in this session is how your new technology development or new materials would interact with earth system basically. Would you're changing many knobs at the same time by introducing new technology. How would it impact? Would it impact? Would it be a big deal or is not a big deal? What should we monitor even? I guess those are the questions. And province uh question and I think to me is the answer is depends, right? Do you need to transfer it for a long time versus short distance or what, right? One of the reasons people like converting CO2 to high energy density hydrocarbon is we already know how to move hydrocarbon all over the all over the globe without losing energy density too much. It's just so dense that you can move it far. But biomass, you don't want to transfer more than 200 miles because it start to make no sense in terms of carbon emission. You're driving your low energy density biomass with high energy density fuel. They start to make no sense, right? So these are the questions you have to ask when you put your deck or conversion systems, how you going to get to next step.",

I think there are a number of companies already developed how to move air around effectively. I think the challenge now is in material side and then integration to either storage or conversion. Because the capture material development is quite different. So let's think about CO2 deck materials compared to point source capture. What's in air versus flue gas? What's the major difference? Flue gas is mostly CO2 and nitrogen. So when you say CO2 capture is the separating CO2 out of nitrogen stream. Direct air capture, what's in air? We do have nitrogen, but what else do we have?",

So I'm curious about when you do the DAC and I would imagine as you mentioned that we are going to pull air and then trying to remove CO2 apparently. This is something I don't understand is that so do we know how fast CO2 that can diffuse to replenish the the concentration? I right now I don't have that idea about how fast they will be able to I mean if you have 400 ppm after you remove the local environment might become 200 ppm. So so such an equilibration might be so important because there are some amine adsorbents and they all rely on this kind of step change. They will change to a really high uptake all of a sudden like after 300 ppm and they are not going to work before I mean when you have a concentration less than 300 ppm. So this is just a question in my mind about how fast the CO2 they will diffuse in the in the environment in the local environment. Just some a question I have. This is something I'm thinking about.

That's really vision statement for fundamental statement so it will be very important for you guys to look at it if you're in the area CCUS overall. The other one is report Chris Jones and others led is the National Academies report on negative emission technologies. Both are very important report for you guys to read because both of them are in the level of fundamental understanding. There are reports like National Petroleum Council which I was involved in same as Mission Innovation. That one is more like a road map. So if you get a lot of funding from DOE you want to read that one too because it's more submitted to DOE as a road map for near term long term implication of CCUS but the other two article is like a vision statement. What is the fundamental science we need to develop for carbon management for next few decades at minimum. So those I can put into chat later on or share with you guys I will share with everybody.

It's just again you have to consider the flux of of your DAC system right? Well we know that we're going to concentrate CO2 from from PPM level to let's say one to two or 5% CO2 right? But what is the throughput of this system right? In other words is it enough to to use it for methanol for example conversion production through FT process right? How much energy input you need? I mean it goes back to the to the again throughput of your first first unit. Is it going to well also I think it's one of the things that we work is just again coupling point source CO2 capture and oxidative dehydrogenation reaction where you you can convert CO2 let's say to olefins right light olefins using for example ethane or ethylene as the as a co-reactant but that's the question that in fact I have from myself is it really viable to do the same thing with DAC itself not with with point source CO2 because these are fundamentally different though we're talking we're actually considering the same same process but again considering the the engineering aspect of the system I think this is very hard to come up with the with the flow rate right or the or the process requirements that you need to to have to to couple these two. So it's very hard to answer. I think doesn't really matter because you do have CO2 right? It could you can easily you can react it with hydrogen right and hydrogenation of CO2 make it to methanol make it to higher hydrocarbons right or you know other things but I think it's just it's very difficult question to answer it goes back to the to the again to the life cycle analysis first we need to do how much energy input right all of this then we have to then say okay this is the best way but I mean from now I think it's very difficult to you know come up with the right at least in my opinion to right answer for that.",

And people talk about four different colors now right? Black gray green blue hydrogen. And depending on which color you choose it'll be totally different. And another thing is if you're putting that middle of nowhere not only you need to have CO2 conversion reactor but you need to also have a hydrogen production reactor right there because you cannot transfer your hydrogen all the way out to ocean or somewhere else.

        "transcript": "Yeah one thing to add to that is I mean there is a field of seawater capture pulling the carbonate out of seawater and capturing it that way. And one advantage of that is you can couple it to hydrogen production pretty easily. You can do electrolysis I mean there's challenges of doing seawater electrolysis but it's possible and you could directly couple that to carbon capture so you have your hydrogen and CO2 produced at the same place.",
