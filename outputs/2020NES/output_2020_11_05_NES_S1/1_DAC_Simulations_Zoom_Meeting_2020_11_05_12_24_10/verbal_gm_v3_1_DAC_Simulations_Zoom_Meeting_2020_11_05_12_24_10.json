So these are the questions when you try to use The main question we are asked in this session is how your new technology development or new materials would interact with earth system basically. Would you're changing many knobs at the same time by introducing new technology. How would it impact? Would it impact? Would it be a big deal or is not a big deal? What should we monitor even? I guess those are the questions. And province uh question and I think to me is the answer is depends, right? Do you need to transfer it for a long time versus short distance or what, right? One of the reasons people like converting CO2 to high energy density hydrocarbon is we already know how to move hydrocarbon all over the all over the globe without losing energy density too much. It's just so dense that you can move it far. But biomass, you don't want to transfer more than 200 miles because it start to make no sense in terms of carbon emission. You're driving your low energy density biomass with high energy density fuel. They start to make no sense, right? So these are the questions you have to ask when you put your deck or conversion systems, how you going to get to next step. ",

I right now I don't have that idea about how fast they will be able to I mean if you have 400 ppm after you remove the local environment might become 200 ppm. So so such an equilibration might be so important because there are some amine adsorbents and they all rely on this kind of step change. They will change to a really high uptake all of a sudden like after 300 ppm and they are not going to work before I mean when you have a concentration less than 300 ppm.

But what is the throughput of this system right? In other words is it enough to to use it for methanol for example conversion production through FT process right? How much energy input you need? I mean it goes back to the to the again throughput of your first first unit. Is it going to well also I think it's one of the things that we work is just again coupling point source CO2 capture and oxidative dehydrogenation reaction where you you can convert CO2 let's say to olefins right light olefins using for example ethane or ethylene as the as a co-reactant but that's the question that in fact I have from myself is it really viable to do the same thing with DAC itself not with with point source CO2 because these are fundamentally different though we're talking we're actually considering the same same process but again considering the the engineering aspect of the system I think this is very hard to come up with the with the flow rate right or the or the process requirements that you need to to have to to couple these two. So it's very hard to answer. I think doesn't really matter because you do have CO2 right? It could you can easily you can react it with hydrogen right and hydrogenation of CO2 make it to methanol make it to higher hydrocarbons right or you know other things but I think it's just it's very difficult question to answer it goes back to the to the again to the life cycle analysis first we need to do how much energy input right all of this then we have to then say okay this is the best way but I mean from now I think it's very difficult to you know come up with the right at least in my opinion to right answer for that.

So by including quaternary amines can you make more passive approaches for DAC that are then directly interfaced with electrocatalytic materials for for producing perhaps a range of chemicals. You know if you wanted to keep it simple for for developing that up front chemistry then doing things like CO and hydrogen is is one possible route and then you could imagine using those to tap into existing things like Fischer-Tropsch reactions for building up other products from that flue gas mixture. So those are are some ideas that we've been interested in but ",

Praveen has very good points because if you want to make any chemicals and materials and fuels you need hydrogen because CO2 only have carbon and oxygen and where that hydrogen coming from make a huge difference in the overall sustainability of technology. And people talk about four different colors now right? Black gray green blue hydrogen. And depending on which color you choose it'll be totally different. And another thing is if you're putting that middle of nowhere not only you need to have CO2 conversion reactor but you need to also have a hydrogen production reactor right there because you cannot transfer your hydrogen all the way out to ocean or somewhere else. So that's another challenge you have to think about if you want to do conversion to chemicals and fuels other than carbon you're okay right because you don't need hydrogen. ",
