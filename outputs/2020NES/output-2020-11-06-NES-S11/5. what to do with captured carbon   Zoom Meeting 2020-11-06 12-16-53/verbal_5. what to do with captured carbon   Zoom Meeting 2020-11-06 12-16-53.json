Right? So it probably makes more sense to make jet fuel from the CO2 from the flue stack rather than directly from the atmosphere if you're competing head to head. So I'm just wondering unless there is a synergism that okay, something about capture from air than than couples with something that cannot be done with the flue gas. So actually actually maybe then another story I can tell is that one of the challenges with flue gas is that often it's not pure. Right? So often has some impurities. And so maybe that CO2 capture from from air will be cleaner. So then maybe there's a process that requires a cleaner CO2 and then that's how you you you avoid having to purify flue gas.

You know, whether it's CO2 into a carbonate that could be used as a feedstock for synthetic aggregate for concrete and construction or whether the CO2 is a feedstock to be combined with hydrogen for methanol, maybe because it's hard to transport hydrogen, but easier to transport methanol. You know, maybe the CO2 is avoided from a power plant and that's cheaper and easier. But ultimately, you don't get any removal benefit from that. That's only avoiding the emissions to the atmosphere. So I mean, just just thinking openly, you know, about what your skill sets are here, your background, how it could collectively be combined in a collaborative way to think of a proposal idea that we're kind of be super exciting and game-changing and and just thinking about some of these challenges. The fact that, you know, I really like what Julia also said is like jet fuel is an issue.

So one of the things that it's known to be able to do is help to bring the magnesium out of, you know, so if you have a mine tailing waste, you know, and it's got magnesium in it. Often sometimes the magnesium isn't necessarily reactive because it's bound in a silica structure and it's very difficult to get it out. But when you add oxylate or oxalic acid to the solution, it actually helps to dissolve the magnesium and make it reactive for crystallization or mineralization with CO2. And so one of the things like Opus 12 was looking at is working with a company called Solidia. And so very different, but looking at Solidia's process, I don't know if you guys know, Solidia is a company where they make low carbon concrete ultimately. And so one process in which they do that is instead of curing with water, they cure with CO2. And it turns out that if you add oxalic acid in that process, you enhance the uptake of CO2 through the curing process. And so really it's like, you know, that acid allows the magnesium atoms in your feedstock, if it's a mineralization approach, to be more reactive to CO2 and to help bind it. But it would be towards a permanent product, not necessarily like a feedstock like you wouldn't use it as a fuel. You would use it as a part of an enhancement process for mineralizing CO2.

One of the things that is kind of less explored, at least based on my understanding, is using light directly. So one of the things that you can achieve with light, which is difficult to achieve in an electrochemical process, is the one electron reduction of CO2. When you talk about electrochemistry, you're talking about two or more electron reduction of CO2, right? Because one electron has a very, very high overpotential associated with it. So those kind of reductions can be achieved using photoredox chemistry. So essentially using light to drive a photoredox catalyst to become an anion and that anion can push one electron towards CO2. And as far as I understand it, there are operational issues associated with it, which is why as of right now, it's mostly focused on highly specific applications. It could either be things like adding COH groups to aromatics. So basically carboxylates styrene and make a polymer precursor, attach a carboxylic acid to an amine and make an amino acid which can go into pharmaceuticals. So there are a lot of specialized applications that we can think of. The challenge, of course, being making sure that these catalysts are cyclable and coming up with continuous processes. But at least there are lab scale continuous processes that exist now that leverage these light assisted pathways. So I think we can do more difficult chemistry as well beyond what is shown with electrocatalysis. And we can think beyond formic acid, right? Because you can use any kind of substrate and link a carboxylate group to it. ",

So I just keep trying to link the idea between a remote location and direct air capture.

Um we've been doing projects like that in in the Permian Basin in Texas since 1972 and there's been zero leakage and zero accidents of CO2. So it's it's pretty good. But at the same time, those are the projects that are such controversial topics because they also as Fang said, like that's not the answer. Uh you're releasing, you know, more CO2 in the form of burning crude oil in the end. And so if there were opportun but it doesn't mean you can't use depleted oil and gas wells to to store CO2. It's just that can we do that and not take more oil out of the ground because those formations are really appropriate for carbon storage. The saline aquafers are another option, but the the difference is is we have to characterize them better, we have to know more about them because they don't necessarily have say a low permeability cap rock that will keep the CO2 physically trapped initially. Um so they just require a lot more characterization. Yeah. And and people, I think a big part of this is just public acceptance and whether or not every culture or community is um comfortable with the idea of putting carbon dioxide, you know, underground in their backyard.
