So, as mentioned previously, if we want to apply more accurate and other ones computation method to study, for example, the electron count analysis. The challenge is that the computational cost is usually very high and we cannot do studies for many different countries. So if experiments can narrow down the structures of possible candidate sites, that will be very helpful to service. So then we would not waste much time on other unlikely candidate structures. So, because the model system has well-defined structure and it's actually there is a very good opportunity for experiments and service to converse on the study of the model system.",

Kind of building on that, one of the challenges of trying to have standardized model systems is that depending on your exact system, different computational methods are going to work better or worse. And so we could say, well, this method works really well for reactions at copper surfaces, but then you apply it to reactions at some sort of metal oxide surface and it totally fails. And so you can't really standardize things in that type of way. It just",
