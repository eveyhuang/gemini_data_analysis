Let me give you one example that we are probing the solid state materials and probing the redox reactions inside solid state materials with three-dimensional spatial resolution. Now, with a particle of 10 micron size, we are collecting 1.5 million excess absorption spectroscopy for metal cations. So every time we do the experiment with over a week, we get back with 8 to 10 terabyte data. So it's at the point that we have to develop our own machine learning or other advanced data analysis methods to analyze data. Unfortunately, we are still very slow on that end. We are still analyzing data that we collected a few years back. Now, speaking of the other high throughput capability that there are a lot of experimental opportunities at different synchrotron facilities where you can collect a thousand high quality absorption spectra just in one day. Again, beamline scientists and myself, we have been talking about how to streamline the data analysis using high throughput mode, but we are still not making progress on that yet. So the data analysis is still mostly just by hand, individually.",

Since it's the 15 minute point, Jose, do you feel like you're getting enough to sort of talk about in our three minute, you've got your thing up there, it's pretty, it's fairly detailed.
