I find it fascinating from an engineering perspective because one of the one of the interesting things about biomass as an energy source or a feedstock for anything is that it's very distributed. If you manage start to think about BECCS as a power source as well as a way to produce negative emissions, you're now talking about very distributed CO2 or carbon storage. So that leads me to thinking about a future landscape that has either a massive amount of CO2 pipelines if we're going to sequester CO2 geologically or a massive reliance on biochar and the associated costs with shipping solids around for sequestration. And so I'm just I'm unsure which of those two is is lower hanging fruit and more likely to be attainable in the short term because both from a systems engineering and logistics perspective seem complex to me. But if you look at climate models, there's always a massive amount of BECCS that's suggested as a solution for our negative emissions challenge. And in principle, the two parts are there, bioenergy and carbon capture and sequestration, but putting them all together into a system seems really challenging to me.",

It's too chemist talking, but about doing BECCS, but where, instead of sequestration, you you then feed the CO2 you capture into a CO2 polymerization site, and you essentially attach a biomass to CO2 unit onto your CO2 polymer facility, and you can use the energy perhaps to so you can make this little self-sustained essentially factory. I don't know if the economics of that could ever become reasonable, but that's something we've thought about as a way to avoid the like you said, this landscape of CO2 piping seems I don't know. It always seems kind of unreasonable to me that we're going to have all these pipes running all over just moving CO2 underground, but I don't know what your thoughts are about you know more about this than I do.",
