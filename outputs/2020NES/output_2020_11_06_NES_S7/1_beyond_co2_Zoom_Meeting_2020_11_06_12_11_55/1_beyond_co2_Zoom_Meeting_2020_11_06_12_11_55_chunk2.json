            "transcript": "perspective. I was dual zooming during our break yesterday and we had a seminar speaker from Johnson Matthey and they were talking about even for so it was for hydrogen but as a mechanism for hydrogen storage there is a significant push actually to convert electrochemically produced hydrogen thermally converted to ammonia for more easy transportation and then thermal thermocatalytically converted back to hydrogen for the use. Now there can be arguments can be made about whether that's useful or whether you would just want to use the ammonia once you had it but I'm kind of been looking at the economics of that sort of a process is it worth also an electro investigating an electrochemical route to ammonia production if this thermal route is is really so efficient that you can go back and forth simply as a means for more facile transportation even at scale.",

            "transcript": "I would also add the argument of the localized production of ammonia. Those numbers that you just cited benefit hugely from the economy of scale and being able to have these energy recovery for the thermal recovery especially. So if you want to have a distributed network where nitrogen is obviously a a distributed resource can you capitalize on that with such efficiencies.",

            "transcript": "So I can add something here for of course for the energy input from renewable electricity to reduce nitrogen to ammonia is a very attractive route. But still starting from how to say maybe 20 10 years ago there is a big wave coming in doing this nitrogen reduction to ammonia but the more published papers we see but there comes out of a big problem is the let's say it's like called the false positive signals coming from those results that concerns a lot not only my own research but a lot of my friends inside the field they have the concerns about how to repeat others results. It's because the current density nowadays we can do under the room temperature to reduce nitrogen is very very small is less than maybe 0.1 milliamp. There is some report is 1 milliamp or even more but it's really difficult for for people to repeat. So this is also another consideration as Marcel has already mentioned the Haber-Bosch maybe you know several orders of magnitude higher energy efficiency than using the electricity to reduce nitrogen to ammonia. Is that possible for or it doesn't make sense for us to sacrifice some of the energy efficiencies to convert nitrogen to reduce nitrogen to ammonia or we improve the water splitting efficiency to generate the hydrogen we need and go through the Haber-Bosch process to get the ammonia we need. That needs to be debated actually at least at this current stage. But it's still open discussions like in the future we probably will get a very good catalyst to to at room temperature to reduce nitrogen to ammonia that's that's also very possible.",

            "transcript": "Yeah I'll just like to add from a different perspective because I don't work on reactions more on separations is that there's a lot of interest I've seen from doing the reaction from nitrogen conversion from nitrates and I think from a separation perspective there is a advantage there is because you can recover waste nitrate up-concentrate it electrochemically and then use it for upcycling. So there's a lot of interest in electrochemical challenges in the nitrogen product and precursor separation that maybe when integrated with the reactions might make the overall system more efficient just because you can have one happening at the cathode the other at the anode so you have full integration. But I don't know how that fits into the whole energetics. I think from an electrochemical separation perspective there's all sorts of sustainability and chemical consumption advantages.",

So I think there you know there's really good reason to question is that the best route to go you know how much carbon dioxide how much additional carbon dioxide can you capture what are the co-benefits of doing so what are the disbenefits like the extra consumption of say fresh water and nutrients on land and then also what's the degree of permanence like you know I live in California a lot of our natural carbon a lot of our natural climate solutions just went up in flames in the last few months and so when we're thinking about this role of nitrogen it's probably worth zooming out and thinking about you know what's the end fate of that nitrogen.",

            "transcript": "I would like to add to this. I think another role that nitrogen and ammonia can play is as an energy carrier. I think it's a it's a fairly elegant energy carrier we can store it okay ammonia is a bit toxic that's kind of the problem. On the other hand we can actually liquefy it at reasonable temperatures reasonable pressures so it is a fairly good energy carrier we can essentially attach hydrogen atoms to nitrogen shuttle them around and and use them like Linsey said. I think that's just something that we might also want to kind of keep in view it could be a very green sustainable and thus reduce the carbon generation at least it's not carbon negative so that's it's not a negative emission it's a neutral emission technology.",

            "transcript": "I want to mention something about the fundamental side of the nitrogen reduction. So as Haotian previously mentioned there are many experiments about nitrogen reduction to ammonium which cannot be reproduced by other groups. And that's actually a challenge for at least for computational chemists like me because I try to for example if I see a paper published for example in Nature or Science reporting very high performance for the catalytic N2 reduction to ammonia then I would like to follow up these experiments trying to understand why this catalyst is so good what's what is the fundamental mechanism underlying this catalyst but it turns out after some time this paper I mean it cannot be reproduced. Some people are saying their experiments are not done carefully so if I want to follow these papers then I would I would waste some time trying to study something which is actually not experimentally verified. So I think it's very important to get clean experiments reproducible experiments as a basis for for computational studies.",
