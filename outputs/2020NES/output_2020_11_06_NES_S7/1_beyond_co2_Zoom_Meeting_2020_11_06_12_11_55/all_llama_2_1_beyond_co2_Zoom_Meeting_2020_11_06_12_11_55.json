So first of all I don't want to discredit research on nitrogen reduction because I think from a scientific perspective it's fascinating. This dinitrogen bond is fascinating. But when we then look at an engineering perspective when we think about what we need to do to do an electrochemical transformation of nitrogen now we just think at scale right. We need to bring in dinitrogen and we need to bring in protons and we need to bring in current. So we need obviously it's kind of a triple phase boundary or or kind of a gas diffusion electrode kind of design. This will be very difficult especially for bringing in the gaseous species which is very weakly soluble. I think that's where people struggle. Whereas if we are generating hydrogen in an electrolyzer we have no transport problem we just can bring water to the reaction site with very high transport rates generate hydrogen get a gas and then convert it together with a second gas nitrogen in a Haber-Bosch process. So I just think when we look at this from this engineering perspective right this need for a triple phase boundary compared to the ease of generating hydrogen electrochemically we may find ourselves in a situation where when we want to do it at scale we may find it hard to compete with a coupled Haber-Bosch and electrolyzer design.

They also need this type of triple phase boundaries but they can deliver very high current density which means that you can also deliver very high production rate per area of your electrode right. But the challenge here now is we don't have as a platinum as efficient in ORR as an unknown catalyst we can have for NRR. That's I think will be the critical challenge here to deliver the the scale that you mentioned to compete with Haber-Bosch.",

I feel like you know we're asked to dream big right and the topic is beyond CO2 and you know come up with the craziest idea we can come up with. And you know on one hand from a chemistry perspective the nitrogen molecule doesn't have a dipole so it's really hard to activate for you at a surface at a molecule you name it. But on the other hand you know I think that there are from a synthetic perspective there are a lot of other products that could be made from a nitrogen reduction process and so you know if that is a way to frame the question not necessarily in terms of replacing Haber-Bosch which we know that is difficult but maybe adding a different kind of value to a process and so something that comes to mind is capturing carbon dioxide converting it to formaldehyde then making ammonia electrocatalytically and there are some systems that do this and then just adding a cyanide source and making amino acids. You know these are basic building blocks for organic synthesis and pharmaceutical science and you know these discussions today have really kind of catalyzed this these ideas where you know maybe we just need to think a little bit bigger right and you know Haber-Bosch is extraordinarily difficult to make an argument against but maybe there are other ways to frame the problem as an opportunity in a different context.",

I find it fascinating from an engineering perspective because one of the interesting things about biomass as an energy source or a feedstock for anything is that it's very distributed. So if you manage start to think about BECCS as a power source as well as a way to produce negative emissions, you're now talking about very distributed CO2 or carbon storage. And so that leads me to thinking about a future landscape that has either a massive amount of CO2 pipelines if we're going to sequester CO2 geologically or a massive reliance on biochar and the associated costs with shipping solids around for sequestration. And so I'm just I'm unsure which of those two is is lower hanging fruit and more likely to be attainable in the in the short term because both from a systems engineering and logistics perspective seem complex to me. But if you look at climate models, there's always a massive amount of BECCS that's suggested as a solution for our negative emissions challenge. And in principle the two parts are there, bioenergy and carbon capture and sequestration, but putting them all together into a system seems really challenging to me.",

It's two chemists talking but about doing you know BECCS but where the instead of sequestration you you then feed the CO2 you capture into a CO2 polymerization site and you essentially attach a biomass to CO2 unit onto your CO2 polymer facility and you can use the energy perhaps to you can make this little self-sustained essentially factory. I don't know if the economics of that could ever become reasonable but that's something we've thought about as a way to avoid the like you said this landscape of CO2 piping seems unreasonable to me that we're going to have all these pipes running all over just moving CO2 underground but I don't know what your thoughts are about you know more about this than I do.",
