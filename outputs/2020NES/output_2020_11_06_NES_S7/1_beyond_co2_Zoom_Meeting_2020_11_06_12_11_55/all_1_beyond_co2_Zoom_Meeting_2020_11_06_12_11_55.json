Now, there can be arguments can be made about whether that's useful or whether you would just want to use the ammonia once you've had it. But I'm kind of then looking at the economics of that sort of a process.

But still starting from how to say maybe 20 10 years ago, there is a big wave coming in doing this nitrogen reduction to ammonia. But the more published papers we see, but there comes out a big problem is the let's say it's like called the false positive signals coming from this result. That concerns a lot, not only my own research, but a lot of my friends inside the field, we have the concerns about how to repeat others results. It's because the current density nowadays we can do under the room temperature to reduce nitrogen is very, very small. It's less than maybe 0.1 milliamp. There is some report is 1 milliamp or even more. But it is really difficult for for people to repeat. This is also another consideration as Marcel has already mentioned the harbor Bosch, maybe, you know, several orders of magnitudes higher energy efficiency than using the electricity to reduce nitrogen to ammonia. Is that possible or it doesn't make sense for us to sacrifice some of the energy efficiencies to convert nitrogen to reduce nitrogen to ammonia or we improve the water splitting efficiency to generate the hydrogen we need and go through the harbor Bosch process to get the ammonia we need. That needs to be debated actually if at least at this current stage. But it's still open discussions like in the future we probably will get a very good catalyst to to add room temperature to reduce nitrogen to ammonia. That's that's also very possible.",

And I think from a separation perspective, there is a advantage there is because you can recover waste nitrate of concentrated electrochemically and they use it for upcycling. So there's a lot of interesting electrochemical challenges in the nitrogen product and precursor separation that maybe when integrated with the reactions might make the overall system more efficient just because you can have one happening at the cathode, the other at the anode. So you have full integration. But I don't know how that fits into the whole energetics. I think from an electrochemical separation perspective, there's all sorts of sustainability and chemical consumption advantages.",

So I think there, you know, there's really good reason to question is that the best route to go, you know, how much carbon dioxide, how much additional carbon dioxide can you capture? What are the co-benefits of doing so? What are the disbenefits, like the extra consumption of say fresh water and nutrients on land? And then also, what's the degree of permanence? Like, you know, I live in California, a lot of our natural carbon a lot of our natural climate solutions just went up in flames in the last few months.

Okay. Ammonia is a bit toxic. That's kind of the problem. On the other end, um we can actually liquefy it at reasonable temperatures, reasonable pressures. So it is a fairly good energy carrier. We can essentially attach hydrogen atoms to nitrogen, shuffle them around and and use them like Lindsay said. I think that's just something that we might also want to kind of keep in in view. It could be a very green, sustainable and thus reduce the carbon generation at least. It's not a carbon negative, so that's it's not a negative emission. It's a neutral emission technology.",

So I first of all, I don't want to discredit research on nitrogen reduction because I think from a scientific perspective, it's fascinating. This nitrogen dinitrogen bond is fascinating. But when you then look at an engineering perspective, when we think about what we need to do to do an electrochemical transformation of nitrogen. Now we just think at scale, right? We need to bring in dinitrogen and we need to bring in protons and we need to bring in current. So we need obviously a kind of triple phase boundary or or kind of a gas diffusion electrode kind of design. This will be very difficult, especially if we're bringing in the gaseous species, which is very weakly soluble. I think that's where people struggle. Whereas if we are generating hydrogen in an electrolyzer, we have no transport problem. We just can bring water to the reaction side with very high transport rates, generate hydrogen, get the gas, and then convert it together with the second gas nitrogen in a in a in a Harbor Bosch process. So I just think when we look at this from this engineering perspective, right? This need for a triple phase boundary compared to the ease of generating hydrogen electrochemically, we may kind of find ourselves in this situation where when we want to do it at scale, we might we may find it hard to compete with the coupled Harbor Bosch and and electrolyzer design.

And, you know, on one hand, from a from a from a chemistry perspective, the nitrogen molecule doesn't have a dipole, so it's really hard to activate for you at a surface, at a molecule, you name it. But on the other hand, you know, I think that there are from from a synthetic perspective, there are a lot of other products that could be made from a nitrogen reduction process. And so, you know, if that is a way to, you know, frame the question not necessarily in terms of replacing Harbor Bosch, which we know that is difficult, but maybe adding a different kind of value to to to a process. And so something that comes to mind is capturing carbon dioxide, converting it to formaldehyde, then making ammonia electrocatalytically, and there are some systems that do this, and then just adding a cyanide source and making amino acids. You know, these are basic building blocks for organic synthesis and pharmaceutical science. And, you know, these discussions today have really kind of catalyzed these ideas where, you know, maybe we just need to think a little bit bigger, right?

It's already very good, but it's not as very high because they they they involves a lot of product separation and a lot of organic waste and selectivity over there. And in some recent research, people noticed that the catalyst to drive the oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide seems to be quite easy to find out, much easier than the nitrogen reduction is there are many different types of catalyst that can very selectively reduce oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. And that could be something maybe the hydrogen peroxide market is not as huge as ammonia, right?

There was almost a loss for the commune to get rid of this wood. And some guy had this really good idea. We just um we just install district heating, combined heat and power, and now they're just cutting their trees. It's fully sustainable and now everyone has pretty much free heat and there is also a little bit of electricity production. I think these are very elegant implementations. Probably shipping the wood from the US is probably not the smartest thing, but if you can use your local wood, it's like you don't even need your solar cells, right?

I find it fascinating from an engineering perspective because one of the one of the interesting things about biomass as an energy source or a feedstock for anything is that it's very distributed. If you manage start to think about BECCS as a power source as well as a way to produce negative emissions, you're now talking about very distributed CO2 or carbon storage. So that leads me to thinking about a future landscape that has either a massive amount of CO2 pipelines if we're going to sequester CO2 geologically or a massive reliance on biochar and the associated costs with shipping solids around for sequestration. And so I'm just I'm unsure which of those two is is lower hanging fruit and more likely to be attainable in the short term because both from a systems engineering and logistics perspective seem complex to me. But if you look at climate models, there's always a massive amount of BECCS that's suggested as a solution for our negative emissions challenge. And in principle, the two parts are there, bioenergy and carbon capture and sequestration, but putting them all together into a system seems really challenging to me.",

I don't know if the economics of that could ever become reasonable, but that's something we've thought about as a way to avoid the like you said, this landscape of CO2 piping seems I don't know.
