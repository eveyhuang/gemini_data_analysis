Somebody mentioned the nitrogen-nitrogen bond is very stable, hard to break, while the nitrogen-oxygen bond is a little bit easier. And if we're talking about CO2, I mean technically beyond CO2, but can CO2 be an oxidant to oxidize dinitrogen to form NOx which then we can process downstream through other means? I know there's a lot of technology in NOx reduction out there already. So, just a thought to put out there.",

Probably we should do some literature search to see if this reaction happened before and if we can really make that very efficient I believe because it will be a maybe a more accessible route than directly electrochemically reduce nitrogen instead. Because if you are activating nitrogen to NO or other type of NOx it will be much easier to directly reduce to ammonia much much easier.",

I know in one of the other groups we were talking about how are you going to remove oxygen if you want if you want to have a direct air CO2 capture, oxygen is a problem. Could you have a pretreatment to remove oxygen while maybe you're even directly oxidizing nitrogen as a pretreatment means and as a consequence you get nitric acid, you know something like that. But there's probably a reason why this isn't done with all the automotive catalysis out there already. The fact that you know CO2 and nitrogen are in the exhaust stream of an automobile.

I think it makes sense right because currently spacecraft are losing hydrogen atoms because they use the Sabatier process. They use ruthenium oxide supported on TiO2 something like that on the ISS to to take CO2 and make methane and I think they vent the methane.
