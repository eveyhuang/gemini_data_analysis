Uh so my um work is focused on uh electrochemical separations. Um a little bit related to CO2 in the sense that we usually try to um focus on purifying uh liquid phase molecules. I think a big focus of my lab currently is on isomeric type separations so molecules that look very similar. Um and I think that that can go beyond uh carbon dioxide space which is I guess related to the topic.",
