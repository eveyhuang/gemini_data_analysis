So my work is focused on electrochemical separations, a little bit related to CO2 in the sense that we usually try to focus on purifying liquid phase molecules. I think a big focus on my lab currently is on isomeric type separations. So molecules look very similar and I think that that can go beyond the carbon dioxide space, which is I guess related to the topic.",
