      "transcript": "You're you're you're messing with the hydrogen. Do you want me to put some jam on it for you? No, what's going to happen is the following. You want to keep carbon oxide on the surface, right? Because you want to make higher carbons, right? So you want CO on the surface. But the problem is you have an isotherm. You go hot and push the CO away. And then you start having more sites for hydrogen generation. And so then you need to up your pressure. And so I was doing CO2 reduction at 1,500 PSI actually CO reduction, which then completely changes your mechanistic regime. It kind of bursts. It's terrible. Like it drove me almost mad. So, just that's all I'm saying. It's like I've been a little bit around challenges in that makes things go very, very crazy, very, very quickly. So we know there's a reaction around room temperature, ambient pressure. But as you start moving away from there, I think there's a lot of space to explore. I hope this answers your question.",

      "transcript": "There's a commercial product already on the market doing at elevated temperature. So they have a recent review paper just published in Science, I think, a couple of weeks ago. You can read that one. So they have a stable performance over thousand hours. The main product is CO because at high temperature, you can't produce any multi-carbon product. CO is the only thing you will get. Of course, they have these challenging issues with coke formation and also they have these durability issues. But they already proved they can run thousand hours, right? There's nothing we can complain. They say no temperature can run much longer than that. We don't. So, the only difference, I think, between low temperature versus high temperature rod is low temperature actually gives us opportunity to do more interesting chemistry that you cannot do at high temperatures. But high temperatures definitely has some unique features there.",
