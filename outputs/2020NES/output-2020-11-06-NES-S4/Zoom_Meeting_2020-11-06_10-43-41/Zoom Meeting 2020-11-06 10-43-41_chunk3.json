In terms of over potentials, those are related to the activity. And so there's multiple over potentials for what activity you want to get. At least in the field of homogeneous collective catalysis, I think there these things are a little bit more worked out in terms of their taffle relationships and extracting rate constants for a process or a maximum turnover frequency. And in principle, you can relate that back then to activation energies, uh if you take into account the iron relationship.",

But then the over potential, you need to define it in terms of current. Like some people say like, well, it's for hydrogen evolution. Yeah, we need it takes 10 milliamps per square centimeter. And then the surface area they are using is different and it's I think this is an important point. Um I think we should not talk in terms of over potentials. Um yeah.",
