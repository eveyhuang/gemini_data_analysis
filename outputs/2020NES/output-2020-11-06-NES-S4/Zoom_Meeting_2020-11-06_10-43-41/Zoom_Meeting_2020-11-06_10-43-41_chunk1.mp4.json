Uh, someone yesterday told me that they were getting paid by a company to make oxylate and bury that underground. So are there products that aren't necessarily fuels that would be useful because they're stable and we can put them in the ground and they're, I mean, are there sort of precursors to CO2 mineralization that we can make electrochemically?",

Um, you know, everybody looks at concrete, that's not really enough of a chemical issue, but I think there are new materials that could expand. You know, I I work with Andre Bardo a lot and his assessment is that there's only about a billion tons of CO2 emissions potential available in the whole chemical industry. And okay, I'll take a billion tons, but that's nothing like what we need. So the question is, is there some new thing we could do that 20 years from now we could be using an enormous amount of it would be a long-lived use of these things. That that one fascinates me.",

Yes, it is not negative emission, but we still try to find other energy vectors that are only good for Democrats is because they're forcibly for me. Oh, and then commonly like, yeah, and then commonly because they control the town. That's how it is right now. But what do you mean breaking? Like if there's a tie, the vice president. Yeah, if it's 50/50, the vice president votes. Oh shit. So now maybe it's not negative emission, but if we actually are able to generate they need the president. Really? So it all comes on GA. I mean, makes already actually, they see arrows as a set of immediate technology for carrying around. So I think that's where the value of thinking about fuels may be.

And so the question is, if we go off of fossil fuels, we'll have to replace those feedstock materials. And so I'm curious what the best feedstocks or what are the what are the most important feedstocks to replace in short term?",

And the answer is you're not going to replace the existing feedstocks. You're going to come in with new feedstocks and new processes. And so they're they're very, the the companies that are really engaged in this are Shell, Eni from Italy. Um, they're all and France are investing very heavily in exactly that question and and what those processes should look like. Basically, in Shell, it's called new energy carriers. What's the thing that moves the energy around as you were saying, to store the energy, how are you going to move it around? And it's absolutely not the existing things. It's new things and a fascinating field of of research that it is.",

And despite the fact that our fuels are mixes, anybody at an oil company would be aghast at your statements that they're very, very delicately created mixtures.

But the electrochemical technology is sort of not there in terms of understanding how to make it work efficiently, which I think we touched upon a little bit. So that's certainly an area that with engineering, I think needs to catch up. Um, I don't know if other people are seeing that.",

And I said, oh, room temperature. Clearly, you must like this, right? And so they said that, um, that for a scale-up process, I don't know exactly how how um, how impressive this is. They would actually prefer that the the processes run about 60 degrees. And so when we talk about mechanisms and kinetics and thermodynamics, we need to really think about temperature seriously. And then we started thinking like, okay, well, well, can we induce heat resistively and have a cell that's intentionally resistive that allows us to reach a certain temperature level, right? And so that's kind of how we got down the rabbit hole of of trying to diagnose kind of how how thermal effects work. Um, and an unknown factor, I guess, in anything that we do.",
