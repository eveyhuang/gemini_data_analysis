In terms of overpotentials, those are related to the activity. And so there's multiple overpotentials for what activity you want to get. At least in the field of homogeneous collective catalysis, I think there these things are a little bit more worked out in terms of their Tafel relationships and extracting rate constants for a process or a maximum turnover frequency. And in principle, you can relate that back then to activation energies if you take into account the iron relationship.",

Depending on the kinetic model, what about Bobby? There is no such thing as an overpotential. What is this like? Either we can say, we can try to say like what is the thermodynamic potential at which the reaction should onset if we know the microkinetic model. But then the overpotential, you need to define it in terms of current. Like some people say like, well, it's for hydrogen evolution. Yeah, we need, it takes 10 milliamps per square centimeter. And then the surface area they are using is different and it's, I think this is an important point. I think we should not talk in terms of overpotentials.",

So, my understanding the definition overpotential is defined as the thermodynamic potential you are going to have to either make hydrogen or make CO2. So, no matter, so that's how I understand, how I understand is overpotential. But if you talk about current based overpotential because that's how, that's the way how people report the data. But the true meaning of overpotential is always compared to the thermodynamic potential at, you know, kind of equilibrium, equilibrium potential at the test conditions. So, like for example, for hydrogen evolution at different pH value, your thermodynamic potential are different for hydrogen evolution. Okay. Yeah, that's, that's, that's what I have thought about overpotential.",

I would, at least for an electrochemical reaction, you can have an infinite range of overpotentials each defined with the current that's produced at that overpotential. In homogeneous catalysis, if you're benchmarking, you can talk about the overpotential in a well-defined manner where you relate it to the fraction of catalyst at the electrode surface in their activated form. And when you can activate half of the catalyst, that's the value Ecat over 2, which is a thermodynamic benchmark in that case and is related to the kinetic benchmark of the maximum turnover frequency, which is a rate constant. And so again, I say maybe I'm preaching to the choir for some folks on this channel. A lot of this has been worked out.",

And I feel like that is something that, what are the spectroscopic tools? And if they exist, why aren't we using them? What are the problems with that?

There's a lot of work on going into image, let's say, feature recognition from noisy images. So trying to push the capability of detection of the microscope in terms of understanding the surface structures and the location of adsorbates at surface defects. So it's not a routine technique and a microscope imparts restrictions on both chemistry and reactor design, which may not be useful for realistic process designs, but",
