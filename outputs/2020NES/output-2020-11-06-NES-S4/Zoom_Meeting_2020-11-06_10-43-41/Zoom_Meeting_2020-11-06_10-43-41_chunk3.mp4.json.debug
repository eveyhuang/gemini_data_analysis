Uh on heterogeni surfaces it was pointed out this gets trickier because you have multiple sites and and then there's going to be multiple barriers that you're thinking about for for different processes that are occurring. Um in terms of over potentials, those are related to to the activity. And so there's multiple over potentials for what activity you want to get. At least in the field of homogeneous electrocatalysis, I think there these things are a little bit more worked out in terms of their tafel relationships and extracting rate constants for for a process or a maximum turnover frequency. And in principle you can relate that back then to activation energies uh uh if you if you take into account the iring relationship.",

So my understanding the definition over potential is defined as the the the thermodynamic potential uh you are going to have to either make hydrogen or make CO2. So no matter so uh that's how I how I understand this over potential. But if you talk about current based over potential because uh that's how that's the way how people report the data. But the true meaning of over potential is always compared to the uh the thermodynamic potential at you know, kind of equilibrium uh equilibrium potential at the uh you know, test conditions. So like for example, for hydrogen evolution at different pH value, your thermodynamic potential are different for hydrogen evolution. Okay. Yeah, that's that's that's what I have thought about the uh over potential.",

I I thought it was I thought it was kind of fascinating because as a as a a geologist, I never think about anything in kinetic terms. Everything's always in equilibrium.

Um in homogeneous catalysis if you're benchmarking uh that you can talk about the over potential in a well defined manner uh where you relate it to the fraction of catalyst at the electrode surface in their activated form. And when you can activate uh uh half of the catalyst, that's the value E cat over two which is a thermodynamic uh benchmark in that case and is related to the kinetic benchmark of the maximum turnover frequency uh which is a rate constant.",

Uh on heterogeni surfaces it was pointed out this gets trickier because you have multiple sites and and then there"s going to be multiple barriers that you"re thinking about for for different processes that are occurring. Um in terms of over potentials, those are related to to the activity. And so there"s multiple over potentials for what activity you want to get. At least in the field of homogeneous electrocatalysis, I think there these things are a little bit more worked out in terms of their tafel relationships and extracting rate constants for for a process or a maximum turnover frequency. And in principle you can relate that back then to activation energies uh uh if you if you take into account the iring relationship.",

So my understanding the definition over potential is defined as the the the thermodynamic potential uh you are going to have to either make hydrogen or make CO2. So no matter so uh that"s how I how I understand this over potential. But if you talk about current based over potential because uh that"s how that"s the way how people report the data. But the true meaning of over potential is always compared to the uh the thermodynamic potential at you know, kind of equilibrium uh equilibrium potential at the uh you know, test conditions. So like for example, for hydrogen evolution at different pH value, your thermodynamic potential are different for hydrogen evolution. Okay. Yeah, that"s that"s that"s what I have thought about the uh over potential.",

Um in homogeneous catalysis if you"re benchmarking uh that you can talk about the over potential in a well defined manner uh where you relate it to the fraction of catalyst at the electrode surface in their activated form.
