And okay, I'll take a billion tons, but that's nothing like what we need. So the question is, is there some new thing we could do that 20 years from now we could be using an enormous amount of that would be a long-lived um use of these things.

And I said, oh, room temperature clearly you must like this, right? And they said that um for a scale up process. I I don't know exactly how how how um have approached this. They would actually prefer that the the the process is sort of about 60 degrees. And so when you talk about mechanisms and kinetics and thermodynamics, we need to really think about that seriously and then we started thinking like, okay, well, well, can we induce heat resistively to have a cell that's intentionally resistive that allows us to reach a certain temperature level, right? And so that's kind of how we got down the rabbit hole of of trying to diagnose kind of how how thermal effects work. Um and um you know, so.",

And I needed to slow it down. So I went to minus 40 degrees and that that can be really helpful to then um actually change these rate constants and that allows me then to actually distinguish from. But um what I I really think that operating at higher temperatures is important. Uh because the the real reason like why engineers that's kind of like my engineering, right? Why engineers like high temperatures is because there is the realization that whenever you run an electrochemical system, you will have so much resistance somewhere or even kinetic losses that this thing heats up. And you need to get rid of this heat. And if you're at if you're device only works at room temperature, the only thing you can do is you need a compressor, you need to go cool. And then your energy balance is lost, you're done, right? So you want to run at like 100 degrees because then you can.",
