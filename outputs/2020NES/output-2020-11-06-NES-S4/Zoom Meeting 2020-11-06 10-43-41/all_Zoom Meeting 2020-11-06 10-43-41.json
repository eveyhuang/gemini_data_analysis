By engineers like high temperatures is because there is the realization that whenever you run an electrochemical system, you will have so much resistance somewhere or even kinetic losses that this thing heats up. And you need to get rid of this heat. And if you're at if your device only works at room temperature, the only thing you can do is you need a compressor, you need to go cool.

So you want CO on the surface. But the problem is you have an isotherm. You go hot and push the CO away. And then you, you start having more sites for, for hydrogen generation. And, uh, so then you need to up your pressure. And so I was doing CO2 reduction at 1,500 PSI actually, CO reduction at 1,500 PSI, which then completely changes your mechanistic regime. This is the kind of words, terrible, like, it drove me almost mad. So, just, that's all I'm saying. It's like I've been a little bit around challenges.
