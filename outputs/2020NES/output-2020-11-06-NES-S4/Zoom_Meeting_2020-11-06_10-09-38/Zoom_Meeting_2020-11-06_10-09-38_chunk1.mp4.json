I'm an assistant professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Utah State University. My research group has been working on both battery chemistry and electrocatalysis. Regarding the topic for this conference, we have been working on both electrochemical reduction for CO2 and N2 reductions. And recently we have got a lot of chance for inter-reactions for CO2 reduction. We have been working on both, you know, protein-based and heterogeneous-based catalysts for upgrading of CO2, you know, with kinetic study and collaboration with computational chemists. Yeah, that's what we have been doing. Yeah, we have also focused, not focused on the device development for fuel cell and flow cell, something like that.",
