We also study metal oxide interfaces, um, which are primarily relevant in like lithium and sodium conducting oxides, um, at the interface with the pure metals. For this conference, I'm pretty interested in looking at electrical and electrochemical properties of interfaces as they pertain to reactions with CO2. So we do various types of high resolution structural imaging in the electron microscope and spectroscopy. Nice to meet you all.",

I'll make one that is is sort of the reflection of that is what are the barriers to success here? There's an enormous amount of of literature around catalysis, a lot of electrochemistry. Um, what what are the barriers to moving that into, you know, really cleaning up the, uh, the atmosphere, you know? Um, so that's my request. Do we do we have other, um, other thoughts on the sort of what you want to get out of this right now?",

Um, so what needs to happen and then how, you know, of the things that we know right now, what are the what are we most far from, um, to make those metrics? So in my opinion, um, it's it's better catalyst, but also, um, you know, being able to deal with either the low concentration of CO2 in the air, right? Because we we're talking about CO2 reduction and we in our labs look at catalyst using a a tank that we buy that's high purity. And I know firsthand that, you know, if we have less high purity or oxygen air system, then everything goes to hell. Um, so if we want to move towards more practicality, we have to think about the the low concentration in our feed stock, um, so that the process becomes more efficient.",

Um, um, thermodynamics, right? So, um, you know, um, that's one thing. And then in addition to that, you also have issue of oxygen tolerance tolerance, right? If you're going to try to do direct air capture, then air kills your your capturing, uh, chemical locus, then, um, that's that's a huge problem. So there's some some hurdles there, um, in thermodynamics and then also kind of stability of the systems that we're we're we're studying.",

So, uh, most of the chemistry that we're interested in is in liquids, liquids, electrodes, electrolytes. And I don't think we really know how to, uh, manage those gases. Uh, we can do it at some level in the in the lab scale, but then when you try to scale up any of these processes, we don't really have, um, an understanding of how to put electrons, ions, how to put CO2, how to put liquid water, how to put a solid electrode, uh, and how to make these at a large scale.

So, um, CO2 is so big, the scale is just not not the same scale as the chemicals we trying to make, okay? Um, probably fuel is the only thing we actually produce at a similar scale. So it's really a question about, um, where's the energy coming from? Is the life cycle actually make sense, um, for whatever we're trying to do here? Um, I think have a good understanding of, um, from the economic side, from the life cycle side, will definitely help us to, um, really think about what kind of technology we really need.",

So if you think about the, um, scalable conversion of carbon dioxide at meaningful, you know, industry scale, you have to think about the lifetime of your catalyst and associated with the cost of catalyst. I I don't have too much experience with industry, but maybe someone can chime in. What type of life time we want to achieve for cans for CO2 conversion? So I think the, um, to me, my niche technology seems, you know, the the testing time for CO2 kind of right now is about maybe I guess up to 100 hours at moment. And, um, so which is apparently, uh, not good enough for scale up or long-term application. And also the, um, I I would add this comes to French comment. I think the the product selectivity, like you are doing any catalysis, selectivity is a very important key and which affect the ending purification, right? Purification is a very, you know, expensive, uh, you know, step, uh, you know, towards final product. So I think that's two sense I I want to share.",

Um, and once the temperature when when your experiment is no longer isothermal, then any sort of mechanistic analysis that you're doing, um, does have this unknown factor that can lead to irreproducibility. And so, um, um, you know, long lifetime catalysts are great, um, but trying to study them may have all of these additional factors that people have not yet fully understood or or flushed out. So it's also a matter of of having the basic chemistry being interfaced with engineering. Um, chemical engineers have been thinking about reactor technology for a long time and heat management and mass transport. And, um, I I I think that that's, um, I guess for me right now, a huge, huge gap.",
