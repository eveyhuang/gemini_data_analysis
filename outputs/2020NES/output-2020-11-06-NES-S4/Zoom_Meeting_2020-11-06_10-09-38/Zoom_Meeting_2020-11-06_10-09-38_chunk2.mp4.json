We also study metal oxide interfaces, um which are primarily relevant in like lithium and sodium conducting oxides, um at the interface with the pure metals. For this conference, I'm pretty interested in looking at electrical and electrochemical properties of interfaces as they pertain to reactions with CO2. Um so we do various types of high resolution structural imaging in the electron microscope and spectroscopy. Nice to meet you all.",

Um, so what needs to happen and then how, you know, of the things that we know right now, what are the what are we most far from um to make those metrics. So in my opinion, um it's it's better catalyst but also um, you know, being able to deal with either the low concentration of CO2 in the air, uh right? Because we we talk about CO2 reduction and we in our labs look at catalyst using a a tank that we buy that's high purity. And I know firsthand that, you know, if we have less high purity or oxygen in our system that we're going to get to hell. Um, so we we want to move toward more practicality, we have to think about the the low concentration in our feed stock um so that the process becomes more efficient.",

If you're going to try to do direct air capture and air kills your your capturing uh uh chemical um locus, then um that's that's a huge problem.

So um CO2 is so big, the scale is just not not the same scale as the chemicals we're trying to make, okay? Um, probably fuel is the only thing we actually produce at a similar scale. So it's really a a question about um where's the energy coming from? Is the life cycle actually makes sense um for whatever we're trying to do here. Um, I think uh have a good understanding of um from the economic side from the life cycle side will definitely help us to uh really think about what kind of technology we really need.",

Um, and once the temperature when once your experiment is no longer isothermal, then any sort of um mechanistic analysis that you're doing um does have this unknown factor that can lead to uh irreproducibility and so um um, you know, long lifetime catalysts are great. Um, but uh trying to study them may have all of these additional factors that um people have not yet fully understood or or or flushed out. So it's also a matter of of having the basic chemistry being interface with engineering.
