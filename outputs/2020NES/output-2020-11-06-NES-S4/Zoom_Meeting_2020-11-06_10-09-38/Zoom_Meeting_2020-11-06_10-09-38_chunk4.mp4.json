      "transcript": "Constants can play a role. So, currently, many people just use simplified computational methods. This may work well for certain materials, but not for all the materials. Some case, in some situations, for example, if you use single metal atoms, companies, then we must include the factors such as surface charge and salvation effects. So, I think it's important to develop and use better computation models which can take care of those complex factors into the modeling. Another issue about current modeling method is that they often neglect the kinetics because of the computational complexity. So, they often just give you the some dynamics. The computer looks like it's off right now. I'm just trying to and then use the some dynamics to estimate the kinetics. But we know that it's a kinetics that's more directly relevant to the reaction rates. So, it's very important for us computational scientists to develop good models so that we can directly calculate the kinetics such as the activation energies. And that will give us better understanding, especially when combined with the experiments. And that's actually one major effort that my group is putting into and hope to get some other one advances in this field.",

      "transcript": "I'd add to that that a lot of the heterogeneous catalysts, we don't necessarily know what the active site is. And there may be a whole bunch of different active sites that have different reactivity, different product selectivity. And from the computational side, you have to model every single one of those separately to actually have any clue. I also wanted to loop back to just a bigger picture question. We were talking about fuels earlier. To me, that kind of strikes me as almost counterproductive to the goal of negative emissions because if we're taking the carbon, we're sucking it out of the atmosphere and turning it into a fuel so that we can put it back into the atmosphere. Is that really negative emissions?",
