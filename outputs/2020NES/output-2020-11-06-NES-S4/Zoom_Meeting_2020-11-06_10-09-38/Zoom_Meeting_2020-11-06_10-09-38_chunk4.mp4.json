Some in some uh situations, for example, if you use single metal and some uh companies, then we must include the factors such as surface charge and salvation effects. So I think it's important to to develop and use better computational models which can take care of those complex factors into the modeling. And another issue uh about current modeling measure is that uh they often neglect the kinetics.",

And from the computational side, you have to model every single one of those separately to actually have any clue. Um, I also wanted to loop back to just a bigger picture question. We were talking about fuels earlier. To me that kind of strikes me as almost counterproductive to the goal of negative emissions because if we're taking the carbon, we're sucking it out of the atmosphere and turning it into a fuel so that we can put it back into the atmosphere, is that really negative emissions?",
