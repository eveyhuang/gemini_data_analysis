That's why they use acids, either strong acids or strong bases. They do not work in in in neutral pH. What they're going to do is not very good, right? So we got to figure out this electrolyzer stuff.",

So then everyone runs for ethylene. And the probably a few other products where there is an economic case. But then if we think a little bit forward, like if we actually want to make a pure product, then that is a whole different story, right?
