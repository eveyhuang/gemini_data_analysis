Uh but it it are things these are things that people that work in the electrolyzer field have uh come have been working around uh for a long time. That's why they use acids, either strong acids or strong bases. They do not work in in in neutral pH. What they do, where the conductivity is not very good, right?",

I always wonder when people say you know making one carbon based product I feel like if they're all liquid and they all have various fuel properties and as long as that mixture is consistent can we use it as is.
