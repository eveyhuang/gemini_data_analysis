But are things, these are things that people that work in the electrolyzer field have come, have been working around for a long time. That's why they use acids, either strong acids or strong bases. They do not work in neutral pH. Where the conductivity is not very good, right? This is a very good point, but I'm just trying to figure out this other aspect.",

We can get good selectivity to alcohols, for example, but at low current densities. The faradaic efficiencies are very good, but then the question is, is there a trade-off between current densities and selectivity that we know that there is? And is there any case that you can make to actually operate locally at low current density, but a high faradaic efficiency?",

      "transcript": "So when you lose your product selectivity at high, high current densities, is that to multiple carbon-based products or is that to hydrogen, faradaic hydrogen? Typically ethylene, I mean, you can get high faradaic efficiencies, but they already have put them on my mind. I just had a question I always had about that when people say that is, you know, depending on the application, if we're making liquid fuels, and we have all liquid fuels that are, that are distribution of products, does that matter? Because, for example, JP8 is a fuel, or the stuff that we pump out, and it's a mixture of products, right? And, and it just has the right combustion properties to work in, uh, for us to use it. And so I, I've always wondered when people say, you know, making one carbon-based product. I mean, it feels like they're all liquid and they all have various fuel properties, and as long as that mixture is consistent, can we use it as is? Um, and I, I don't, I'm not an engineer, so I can't answer or, or. Oh, really? Where?",

      "transcript": "Um, I, I can talk about this. Um, um, so when you, when you design a process to, um, usually you have some side reactions, some byproducts. Um, the challenge is, the practical challenge is that when you're trying to sell a product, um, your byproduct become an issue, a reliability to your company. For example, if you operate a company, so, um, you have to find is, usually you will do is to find someone willing to take it. And often time you are running to some troubles, so you have to sell at lower than the market price. That will become a big issue when you're trying to operate a business. You know, for, for scientific speaking, of course, we are, we are scientists, so we are very into how to play with the selectivity, how to improve the production rate. Um, but for business, it's totally different thing. Um, and also, you know, if you look at the current chemical industry, how people really doing this kind of process design, usually they produce multiple products and they do the separation process and they sell the separately. Or they integrated into downstream process trying to make high value chemicals. Um, this is what, why usually if you look at a chemical plant, it's a jungle. They have so many processes going on at the same time.",
