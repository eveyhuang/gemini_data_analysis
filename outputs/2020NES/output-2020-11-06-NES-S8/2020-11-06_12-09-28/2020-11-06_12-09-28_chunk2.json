Um so let me read it so that everybody knows our topic. Uh can novel materials and electrode architectures facilitate CO2 capture and utilization? What are the fundamental design principles for electro catalysts and how can their discovery and optimization be accelerated? Um so that"s our topic. Um and I think it it"s worked well um in the other breakout sessions if if everybody takes a a minute or two and and um writes down a a question or idea that you have pertaining to this topic. Um so we"ll be quiet for a minute or two and and everybody please try try to do that.",
