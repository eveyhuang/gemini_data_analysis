Um so let me read it so that everybody knows our topic. Uh can novel materials and electrode architectures facilitate CO2 capture and utilization? What are the fundamental design principles for electro catalysts and how can their discovery and optimization be accelerated? Um so that's our topic. Um and I think it it's worked well um in the other breakout sessions if if everybody takes a a minute or two and and um writes down a a question or idea that you have pertaining to this topic. Um so we'll be quiet for a minute or two and and everybody please try try to do that.",

We start with amorphous nano material which we can image through and then we observe the crystallization and defect and morphological formation and evolution during thermal treatment. Right now we've only done it in ultra high vacuum but the idea is to do it under different gases too and if we can process material under these reactive gas conditions we can also potentially measure reaction products at different stages of both defect formation and then evolution as the morphology and microstructure changes.",
