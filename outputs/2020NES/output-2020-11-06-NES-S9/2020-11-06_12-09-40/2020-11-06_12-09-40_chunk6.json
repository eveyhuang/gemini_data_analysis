So, um it certainly is viable just as moths are viable for storing methane and things like that. Um so I guess yeah, if you yeah, if you selectively capture CO2 from some sort of point source and then uh you would certainly be able to store it in the moth and transfer it to another location. Um and yeah, people have so I guess yeah, people have looked at like um a lot of like natural gas purification type things where you have like sour natural gas streams, right? So high pressure sources of CO2 and trying to make moths that will selectively store CO2 under high pressure conditions and um that"s kind of analogous to just what you would be thinking about if you wanted to have like a compressed CO2 stream so you could store like a really high density such that it was more efficient to to transport it or things like that.
