And so instead of using industrially produced acid and base, you know, you can just electrochemically split it. Um, and then you can weather it, uh, and then extract your calcium magnesium ions, reacted with the carbonates, produce calcium magnesium carbonate. So that's entirely viable, right?",

That's been widely studied, but I was wondering if people have actually looked at moths for not capture but just storing CO2. So you could actually, you know, if you are in a remote area where you have direct air capture, maybe you could try to store the CO2, ship it to a nearby location and use that capture CO2 for something else. I mean, as an alternative to a pipeline. Is that something that's been explored, studied? Is that something of interest or is it even feasible?",

So um it certainly is viable just as moths are viable for storing methane and things like that. Um so I guess yeah, if you yeah, if you selectively capture CO2 from some sort of point source and then uh you would certainly be able to store it in the moth and transfer it to another location. Um and yeah, people have so I guess yeah, people have looked at like um a lot of like natural gas purification type things where you have like sour natural gas streams, right? So high pressure sources of CO2 and trying to make moths that will selectively store CO2 under high pressure conditions and um that's kind of analogous to just what you would be thinking about if you wanted to have like a compressed CO2 stream so you could store like a really high density such that it was more efficient to to transport it or things like that.",

So you could actually, you know, if you are in a remote area where you have direct air capture, maybe you could try to store the CO2, ship it to a nearby location and use that capture CO2 for something else.

So um it certainly is viable just as moths are viable for storing methane and things like that. Um so I guess yeah, if you yeah, if you selectively capture CO2 from some sort of point source and then uh you would certainly be able to store it in the moth and transfer it to another location. Um and yeah, people have so I guess yeah, people have looked at like um a lot of like natural gas purification type things where you have like sour natural gas streams, right? So high pressure sources of CO2 and trying to make moths that will selectively store CO2 under high pressure conditions and um that"s kind of analogous to just what you would be thinking about if you wanted to have like a compressed CO2 stream so you could store like a really high density such that it was more efficient to to transport it or things like that.", "speaking duration": 72, "nods_others": 0, "smile_self": 0, "smile_other": 0, "distracted_others": 0, "hand_gesture": "None", "interuption": "No", "overlap": "No", "screenshare": "Yes", "screenshare_content": "The screen shows a document titled \"3. new ideas in negative emission CO2 utilization\".
