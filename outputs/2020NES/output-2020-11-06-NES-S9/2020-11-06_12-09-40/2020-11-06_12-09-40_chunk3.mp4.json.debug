      "transcript": "Oh, I just wanted to quickly add that um so there are thermodynamically downhill routes and there thermodynamically uphill routes because CO2 is inherently doesn't have a lot of energy associated with it. It's the lowest carbon state, right? So if you want to take CO2 and put it in its lowest form, then the most logical pathway for that, at least what we what is in our consciousness at this point is that of magnesium or calcium carbonate. Uh it's an inorganic carbonate. And then if you actually want to take the CO2 and then if you want to upcycle it towards to a fuel, then the intermediate there, you'll need to identify it. It's typically carbon monoxide or maybe even a formate. So then the question becomes you can get to a CO, you can get to a formate, but once you have that, how do you get from there to your end goal, which could be a fuel, a polymer, or a product of some kind. Uh and if you have a CO2 molecule and if you want to get it to being in its inorganic carbonate state, what are some of the least energetically intensive pathways to get there? Right. I think that might be one way of thinking about this challenge, right?",

It"s the lowest carbon state, right? So if you want to take CO2 and put it in its lowest form, then the most logical pathway for that, at least what we what is in our consciousness at this point is that of magnesium or calcium carbonate. Uh it"s an inorganic carbonate. And then if you actually want to take the CO2 and then if you want to upcycle it towards to a fuel, then the intermediate there, you"ll need to identify it. It"s typically carbon monoxide or maybe even a formate. So then the question becomes you can get to a CO, you can get to a formate, but once you have that, how do you get from there to your end goal, which could be a fuel, a polymer, or a product of some kind. Uh and if you have a CO2 molecule and if you want to get it to being in its inorganic carbonate state, what are some of the least energetically intensive pathways to get there? Right. I think that might be one way of thinking about this challenge, right?",

Because we are just going to furnish hydrogen but we are not going to release CO2 and also CO2 can recycle back in the process that if it will be electrochemical process, you know, or could be like Fisher trop synthesis and you can use for make from CO2 other ethylene or methanol or but ethanol, any kind of synthetic fuel.
