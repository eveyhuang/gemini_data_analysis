Uh so there is an energy input that you need there to take carbon dioxide to methane, but once you do the pyrolysis you end up with hydrogen that still contains some of the energy. So maybe you would have to look at the cycle whether the energy that you put in as electricity at the end uh what percentage of it remains as the hydrogen, right? But if you have a hydrogen economy in theory you could pump it uh yeah. But making methane just for you can pyrolyze it, right? Uh if you cannot do direct pyrolysis from carbon dioxide, right?",
