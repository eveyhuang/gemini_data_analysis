Uh it"s an inorganic carbonate. And then if you actually want to take the CO2 and then if you want to upcycle it towards to a fuel, then the intermediate there, you"ll need to identify it. It"s typically carbon monoxide or maybe even a formate. So then the question becomes you can get to a CO, you can get to a formate, but once you have that, how do you get from there to your end goal, which could be a fuel, a polymer or a product of some kind. Uh and if you have a CO2 molecule and if you want to get it to being in its inorganic carbonate state, what are some of the least energetically intensive pathways to get there? Right.",

Uh so as opposed to thermo chemical routes, which is primarily heat intensive, if there is a way for us to get our electrons from renewable sources, looking way out into the future here, uh that might be another way of trying to go about producing uh the fuels or the carbonates and carbonates typically going to construction materials or they get buried underground.
