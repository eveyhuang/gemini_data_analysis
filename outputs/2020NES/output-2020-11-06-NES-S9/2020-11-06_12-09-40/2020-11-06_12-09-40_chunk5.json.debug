      "transcript": "And so they would like to grow algae for making biodiesel, but we have to be careful when we're going to feed CO2 to the algae because they have to be in a certain concentration. If we're going to feed algae with 1%, 100% of CO2, they're going just to die. I mean, the percentage and it depends on the algae because there are a lot of variety of algae, but the most used, now I don't remember the Latin name, they have a range that can go can go from 12 to 20% of CO2. If you go higher or lower, they just die. And the problem with algae also, it's not a problem. It's just like that they need a lot of land, you know? Because they have to take sun and they have to take the UV. So they have to be able, you can make stuck, but they have to be able to get the extra ray from the sun, you know, photocatalytic as you said, it's coming from bio. So they need a lot of membrane area, no membrane area, surface area, sorry.",

I think for me the biggest issue isn't land area but water. Because what you need for algae is a lot of water. So it kind of sort of like limits where that you can do this. Um, because you have to find places that have a lot of water and also a lot of sunlight. But a lot of these like really cool new vertical systems solve the land problem.",

If we"re going to feed algae with 1%, 100% of CO2, they"re going just to die. I mean, the percentage and it depends on the algae because there are a lot of variety of algae, but the most used, now I don"t remember the Latin name, they have a range that can go can go from 12 to 20% of CO2. If you go higher or lower, they just die. And the problem with algae also, it"s not a problem. It"s just like that they need a lot of land, you know? Because they have to take sun and they have to take the UV. So they have to be able, you can make stuck, but they have to be able to get the extra ray from the sun, you know, photocatalytic as you said, it"s coming from bio. So they need a lot of membrane area, no membrane area, surface area, sorry.",
