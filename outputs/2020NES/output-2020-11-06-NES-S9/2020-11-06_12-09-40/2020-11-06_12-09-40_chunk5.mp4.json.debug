If we're going to feed algae with 1%, 100% of CO2, they're going just to die. I mean, the percentage and it depends on the algae because there are a lot of variety of algae, but the most used, now I don't remember the Latin name. Um, they have a range that can go can go from 12 to 20% of CO2. Because they have to take sun and they have to take the UV.",
