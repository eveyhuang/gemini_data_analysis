But yeah those are those are interesting basic science questions I think that are are important to probe if we're going to get to something energetically favorable for direct air capture especially not at direct like flue gas versus direct air capture.

And so just thinking about those different conditions I think is important. And that when we separate CO2 it's not a separation from CO2 and nitrogen rarely. I don't know of a situation where it looks like that.

And a lot of these these molecules that people make that are kind of less than 100 grams per mole or so are are molecules that can be are that are commodity chemicals right they're produced on huge scale. So if we can find a way to to just leverage this this this carbon dioxide capture interface with an organic nucleophile converted to something that that that that is useful on scale you know I think that would be a great opportunity to to reinvent the way carbon capture is even thought about right?

The idea being a technology may be viable if you take hybrid approaches where for instance what we're looking at is how can we look at systems where we combine we may make thermal desalination and solar viable if we look at producing two viable outputs like power and water. So in the same vein if we look at the production of two valuable commodities at once electrolysis which I think electrolysis is very efficient from my understanding it's a cost barrier and a lifetime issue of these cells but that may be dated in terms of my understanding of where electrolysis is.
