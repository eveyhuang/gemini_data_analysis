And our group does the uh photochemistry of using uh small molecules like CO2 and methane to convert to uh uh chemical products. And uh we also do uh 2D material synthesis for methane capture absorbent as well as the thin film membrane materials for uh separation. So looking forward to uh writing down all your interesting idea and share to the bigger group. Thank you.",

Hopefully you all will just take it yourselves and we'll not have to do very much. Um I'm a chemical engineer also in chemistry at Georgia Tech. I work in catalysis as well as separations and in separations I've worked on direct air capture for quite some time. So I'm looking forward to hearing uh what you all think. Um what might be fun and exciting. So uh with the introductions uh finished, one way we can start out is just to give everybody maybe a minute or two to think to themselves um what would be an important question on this topic that, you know, we should discuss or that you have a a comment on or a suggestion on. Um we can take this moment to think about, you know, what really interests you as a starting point and then we can just uh offer people an opportunity to kick off the conversation um and we'll see where it goes.",
