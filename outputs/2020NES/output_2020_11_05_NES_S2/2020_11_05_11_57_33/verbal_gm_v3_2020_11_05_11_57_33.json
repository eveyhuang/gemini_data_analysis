Carbon dioxide to us is like the world's the world's worst electrophile if you think about it right? And so if you can electrochemically generate a nucleophile from a compound that you can then break down from either introduction of an electron into an anti-bonding orbital you know there's just you know things like N-heterocyclic carbenes you know you can generate from simple imidazoliums that's a well-known reaction studied for for eons and you know just kind of trying to map out some space in that in that realm for us would be very interesting.

You don't do thermal desalination or you prefer to do reverse osmosis as a system because it's thermodynamically favorable. The idea being a technology may be viable if you take hybrid approaches where for instance what we're looking at is how can we look at systems where we combine we may make thermal desalination and solar viable if we look at producing two viable outputs like power and water. So in the same vein if we look at the production of two valuable commodities at once electrolysis which I think electrolysis is very efficient from my understanding it's a cost barrier and a lifetime issue of these cells but that may be dated in terms of my understanding of where electrolysis is. But if we can look at combining electrolysis with something other valuable product it may...

Charm is one of them, Clean Energy Solutions, LanzaTech to some extent. But these these companies you know one of the things and and you might categorize this as BECCS a little bit. And so we we're familiar with things like blue hydrogen and green hydrogen but in the case of if you're using a biomass waste to produce hydrogen and in the production of that hydrogen you you separate out the CO2 and you store it you have the potential of producing negative hydrogen. And I think that you know that's something that's kind of new and I don't know if that's something you guys have given any thought to as an alternative source of hydrogen and it is a way of taking water out of the air because you're essentially using and exploiting photosynthesis right and CO2 of course. And there are some companies that are kind of thinking about this but not selling it in that way. But that's interesting. It's also just regional so you have to be careful because how much biomass waste is there out there? You know there's no silver bullet.
