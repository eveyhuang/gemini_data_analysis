From my understanding, there are a lot of defective oxide surfaces and how, you know, the thermodynamics and kinetics actually are going to occur on some of those surfaces. I think is also critical, not everything is known and what I feel is like we can use the defects. A lot of times these surfaces have defects because there could be, you know, charge accumulation, charge polarity, all those other things. Those defects actually can we can use it to our advantage. I have to admit I don't know exactly how, but I have seen it used to other, you know, advantage in other fields. And I think there is definitely some possibility to understand the reaction mechanisms on different facets simply by, you know, uh taking you know, taking a route of very fundamental uh understanding both from experiment and theory.

And in the amount and for instance with the oxygen and its interactions with quinones and how that interferes with CO2 reactivity. And the fact that in an exhaust stream it's reducing, right? So in the exhaust stream you have a lot less oxygen than you do in the atmosphere. And so just thinking about those different conditions, I think it's important. Um, and that when we separate CO2, it's not a separation from CO2 and nitrogen. Rarely. I don't know of a situation where it looks like that. So I I think it is also important to just think about as Kelsey you just mentioned, not just the different concentration of CO2 that you're separating from that initial purity of CO2, but also what are the other gases that you have to kind of fight against, you know, when you think of selective CO2 chemistry.",

I guess the challenge we often faced was and just um actually being able to do that in a way that would still give you a a high capacity and reasonable porosity so that you would have reasonable diffusion kinetics through the pores of your materials and things like that. Um, one real semi related I guess idea um that I've been semi curious about but have never really thought through in a lot of of detail is there might be any strategies where you could think about not just tuning in the enthalpy of the interaction of CO2 with the porous material but also somehow impacting the overall entropy change and it's orbit undergoes an interaction with CO2. There's not much you're going to be able to do in terms of changing the intrinsic entropy of CO2 absorbing inside a porous material unless it can somehow still be mobile um and is less confined to the surface. So maybe you could do something but if the in a responsive absorbent uh an absorbent that structure changes in response to absorption or in particular the dynamics of some sort of organic functional group or something change in response to an absorbent in a way that confers some type of entropic advantage um that would drive more CO2 into the material even at a lower enthalpy window if there's potential opportunities there that haven't really been explored.",

But I think it is also really important to understand um the just overarching, you know, bigger picture too. So like in the United States today, if we do a lot of separation of CO2 and we deploy it and we get it at scale, one of the one of the barriers is that we don't have the infrastructure to move the CO2 around. Like site to site it it's it's pretty well known that if you're moving around on the order of 700,000 tons of CO2 from a site that that pipeline infrastructure is cheaper than trucking it. You know, about that about that scale. And so we just don't have a lot of infrastructure for moving CO2 around in the US. And if we're thinking about capture and utilization, that is an opportunity so that we don't have to build all of that pipe pipeline network. But if you're converting it to something like methanol, you know, something that can be easily moved and we know how to do it pretty pretty well, you do have to ask the questions where where does the hydrogen come from?",

Uh that still give you give you you consume the fossil fuel, you produce CO2. But there is also uh the technology uh uh we have been, you know, exploring for a long time that is using electricity for water splitting. Uh now select the the the not select the the efficiency can be very high actually to up to 80% converting electricity to hydrogen to hydrogen. Uh and with the price of the electricity coming down uh, you know, in the future, it can be more attractive. That's one route. Another route is um directly electrifying carbon dioxide into the liquid fuels or other type of fuels. That doesn't involve molecular hydrogen but they still use the protons that is coming from water, you're dumping electrons uh using electrocatalysis into carbon dioxide coupling with the protons from water, you can also directly generate uh you know, formic acid, methanol, ethanol and so on. There is also a field that is uh we are working on uh in terms of uh not directly mixing CO2 with molecular hydrogen and cap like that.

Um, you know, we've been thinking about kind of things that bind carbon dioxide kind of from a zero order perspective. Um, and to us in a way, you know, once something is bound to a carbon dioxide, it's a carboxylate, it's a carboxylic acid that's lost a proton. there's just a lot of organic chemistry that could be happening there to convert um a bound carbon dioxide to an alcohol, for example, by homologation by adding one C1 and so, you know, kind of an off the wall um uh idea of electrifying the carbon dioxide capture component uh would be to just have a large organic structure in which you can generate a nucleophile, bind the CO2 and then convert that carboxylic acid to whatever you need. And there are actually a lot of really old electrochemical methods to to um to address that that that that that kind of process. So that would be um, you know, something that nobody's even thinking about. Um, you know, especially like in the field of of carbon capture that uh would be a way to electrify the the carbon dioxide for for process for a more organic chemistry type application, right? And a lot of these these molecules that people make that are kind of less than 100 grams per mole or so, um uh are are molecules that can be are that are commodity chemicals, right? They're produced on huge scale. So if we can find a way to to just leverage this this this carbon dioxide capture interface with an organic nucleophile converted to something that that that that is useful on scale, you know, I think that would be a great opportunity to to kind of reinvent the way carbon capture is even thought about, right? Because you no longer have to release it, you no longer have to worry about storage and you'd actually be making something valuable directly. Um, just a wild thought out there.",

So I'll I'll be closing us up. But um but I think it's also important to distinguish between the different technologies of direct air capture. Uh they're all very different, you know, and so if it's an electro swing approach and you can turn it off and on and you can you don't need thermal energy in order to regenerate, that's very flexible and a benefit of that kind of an approach. If it's a you know, a global thermostat or a climeworks type of an approach where you can use low grade heat or even maybe coupling really low grade heat to heat pumps uh is an opportunity where you could couple to things like waste heat uh which is a lot of what climeworks is doing today and and if you're interested in that, we wrote a paper on that uh just came out in the spring. coupling to low grade heat from nuclear and also geothermal. Uh but when you take a carbon engineering type approach uh where they require 900 degrees C heat for regeneration, it's not so easy to imagine coupling that. You can't couple that to low there's no such thing as low grade 900 degrees C heat. Waste heat at 900 degrees C. So in that case you do need a dedicated plant that produces thermal energy and uh electric energy for that process. And so I think one thing that I try and do in the messaging of direct air capture is that not all direct air capture technologies are created equal and they're going to couple to energy resources in different ways uh and they're going to be in that case cited in different ways. So the concept of putting a direct air capture plant anywhere is a bit of a short sighted view. And maybe that even we can transition into something like that too and talking about that. And it's not just the energy. Um you know, but there some of these approaches do require water. Some are net producers of water. Some require expensive feed stocks for the materials to actually do the separation. Are have you in your in your work uh have you guys given some consideration of those types of things outside of the energy requirements.",

And if Climeworks openly states that it's $600 a ton today and carbon engineering says that it's end of a kind plant could be $230 per ton. Um, what does that mean? You know, how can we do that? What what in your minds today, what that means, that's why we push utilization so much, right? Because in the end you're producing a product that has value. Um, when we look at a power plant and we, you know, retrofit with carbon capture, what are you producing? You're producing low carbon electricity. And there are consumers out there that care and that might be willing to pay more for low carbon electricity than conventional. Um, but not everybody is, right? Not everybody is. And what we need to have an impact is that price to be affordable for everybody, which is a social equity issue. And so, you know, it's we can have the people that can afford to do things to lean in, but all of that's not going to add up to what we need. And so do you think about these pathways, do you have thoughts about pathways that could help, um, or or is just is it policy is the answer? That's it. Or are there other creative ways that you can think or have you thought about this, I guess.",
