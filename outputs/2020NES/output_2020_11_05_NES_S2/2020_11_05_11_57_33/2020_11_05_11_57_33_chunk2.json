So for semiconductor industry has it and now there's a fuel industry does have it. But I feel like maybe as we are thinking about this up front perhaps there could be in a very organized fashion about negative emission technologies could there be some kind of a benchmark or some kind of a parameter space that we need to focus on identify a few important parameters and build a roadmap for it. I think that would be very interesting.",

A lot of times what I'm seeing is often oxide surfaces are used but very common facets are used. From my understanding there are a lot of defective oxide surfaces and how the thermodynamics and kinetics actually are going to occur on some of those surfaces I think is also critical. Not everything is known and what I feel is like we can use the defects a lot of times these surfaces have defects because there could be charge accumulation charge polarity all those other things. Those defects actually can we can use it to our advantage. I have to admit I don't know exactly how but I have seen it used to other advantage in other fields. And I think there is definitely some possibility to understand the reaction mechanisms on different facets simply by taking a route of very fundamental understanding both from experiment and theory. This is just something unless there is something more to what I'm saying here.",
