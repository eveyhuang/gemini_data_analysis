That that those kind of, you know, if you are going to move on to more renewable sources, then something like that, that is also waste heat actually, that can also be used. I have to admit I'm not exactly sure about the exact magnitude, but based on a lot of stationary SOFCs nowadays which are used, it it provides a lot of power to let's say even American Navy for example station somewhere outside, I have seen. So I'm assuming it's the, you know, the numbers are really high. So that kind of heat also can be utilized for something what you were suggesting.",

Like if we have to get to gigatons somehow, uh, just in this approach alone, there's expectations that direct air capture is going to have to get to gigatons of removal by mid-century. And if Climeworks openly states that it's $600 a ton today and carbon engineering says that it's end of a kind plant could be $230 per ton. Um, what does that mean? You know, how can we do that? What what in your minds today, what that means, that's why we push utilization so much, right? Because in the end you're producing a product that has value. Um, when we look at a power plant and we, you know, retrofit with carbon capture, what are you producing? You're producing low carbon electricity. And there are consumers out there that care and that might be willing to pay more for low carbon electricity than conventional. Um, but not everybody is, right? Not everybody is. And what we need to have an impact is that price to be affordable for everybody, which is a social equity issue. And so, you know, it's we can have the people that can afford to do things to lean in, but all of that's not going to add up to what we need. And so do you think about these pathways, do you have thoughts about pathways that could help, um, or or is just is it policy is the answer? That's it. Or are there other creative ways that you can think or have you thought about this, I guess.",

Um, I think that there's some interesting things that can come about there but and and I I do think ultimately it's it's going to be a developing a legislative framework that that that facilitates that though.
