That that those kind of if we are going to move on to more renewable sources then something like that that is also waste heat actually that can also be used. I have to admit I'm not exactly sure about the exact magnitude but based on a lot of stationary SOFCs nowadays which are used it provides a lot of power to let's say even American Navy for example station somewhere outside I have seen so I'm assuming the numbers are really high so that kind of heat also can be utilized for something what you were suggesting.",

            "transcript": "I wonder too have you guys ever thought like I know Pratik you asked about this earlier of like the costing of all of this the operating maybe the capital. So let's ask the question how are we going to finance all this right? Like if we have to get to gigatons somehow just in this approach alone there's expectations that direct air capture is going to have to get to gigatons of removal by mid-century. And if Climeworks openly states that it's $600 a ton today and Carbon Engineering says that it's nth of a kind plant could be $230 per ton what does that mean? You know how can we do that? What in your minds today what that means that's why we push utilization so much right because in the end you're producing a product that has value. When we look at a power plant and we retrofit with carbon capture what are you producing you're producing low carbon electricity and there are consumers out there that care and that might be willing to pay more for low carbon electricity than conventional but not everybody is right not everybody is and what we need to have an impact is that price to be affordable for everybody which is the social equity issue. And so you know it's we can have the people that can afford to do things to lean in but all of that's not going to add up to what we need. And so do you think about these pathways do you have thoughts about pathways that could help or or is just is it policy is the answer? Is that it? Or are there other creative ways that you can think or have you thought about this I guess.",

They you know they're interested in understanding ways to you know there's the certificate route of you know I produce this much carbon so I pay this much to remove it or there's taxes those those types of things but I think if we if we can think about it in a as you said in the social equity from the social equity standpoint of you know we've generated this waste and and how do we manage it I think that there's some interesting things that can come about there but and and I I do think ultimately it's it's going to be a developing a legislative framework that that that facilitates that though and it has to be a global thing right what what works for the US it's not fair to impose that on a developing country and and so there's there's it's a very multifaceted problem.",

I don't know if that if that is relevant and how that will affect stuff but just thinking that yeah the conversion of CO2 from the air is the only thing. I don't know if thinking about nitrogen conversion could work or what would be that what would be the implications for that or how difficult it would be I'm guessing that has to be pretty difficult but",

So is that possible through a direct air capture type of approach instead of all these traditional centralized chemical engineering plant approach so.",
