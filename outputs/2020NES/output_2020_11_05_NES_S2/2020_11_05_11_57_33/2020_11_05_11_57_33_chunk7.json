And one of the things that works in our favor is that climates that are favorable for moisture swing capture provide lots of land opportunities to partner with solar and so but I think it's a really good point of what what are the energy requirements and I think it's a it's an important geographical question too.",

            "transcript": "And I will say a little bit since there's a tiny bit of pause here. And and Chris I know you have to go I don't know he's going to go teach I think in a little bit so I'll I'll be closing us up but but I think it's also important to distinguish between the different technologies of direct air capture. They're all very different you know and so if it's an electro-swing approach and you can turn it off and on and you you don't need thermal energy in order to regenerate that's very flexible and a benefit of that kind of an approach. If it's a you know a global thermostat or a Climeworks type of an approach where you can use low-grade heat or even maybe coupling really low-grade heat to heat pumps is an opportunity where you could couple to things like waste heat which is a lot of what Climeworks is doing today and and if you're interested in that we wrote a paper on that just came out in the spring. Coupling to low-grade heat from nuclear and also geothermal. But when you take a carbon engineering type approach where they require 900 degrees C heat for regeneration it's not so easy to imagine coupling that you can't couple that to low there's no such thing as low-grade 900 degrees C heat. Waste heat at 900 degrees C. So in that case you do need a dedicated plant that produces thermal energy and electric energy for that process. And so I think one thing that I try and do in the messaging of direct air capture is that not all direct air capture technologies are created equal and they're going to couple to energy resources in different ways. And they're going to be in that case sited in different ways. So the concept of putting a direct air capture plant anywhere is a bit of a short-sighted view. And maybe that even we can transition to something like that too and talking about that. It's not just the energy you know but there are some of these approaches do require water some are net producers of water some require expensive feedstocks for the materials to actually do the separation. Have you in your in your work have you guys thought given some consideration of those types of things outside of the energy requirements?",

            "transcript": "Something I have I do a lot of fundamental work and something I often wonder in this kind of project is also the cost. Let's say something is you know we come up with something really good but can we commercialize it if it's like way too expensive or how does the cost parameter come into the equation when we are trying to commercialize something or you know that that is something I have thought honestly I don't have any answer for that.",

            "transcript": "Yeah well and with DAC that's a nuanced thing right and and that can be driven by administration and and subsidies and there's federal subsidies that that are rolling technologies out but but I mean it that's the TEA is is an important consideration for any of these technologies. Catherine one one thing I wanted to circle back to right is is if we we can turn that question on its head and say where where do we have energy available in some form or another. And so you know one question an interesting discussion I had with Sue Hovorka recently was thinking about wave energy wind energy and and can you do DAC at at on the coastlines right which is not a very favorable environment for DAC technologies that are available today. But so that presents an opportunity to rethink the design of the capture process to capitalize on some potentially available energy sources. And you also have kind of off off coast you know platforms that exist that are being sunsetted and so there's a little bit of infrastructure there that you could tap into for you know a plant like like Jen was saying.",

            "transcript": "Yeah it's a great point. I mean that's part of kind of my thinking with that ocean capture project too is like using an abandoned oil rig offshore couple it to some you know wind turbines and you know everything's kind of on site and you're taking advantage of natural energy sources. But yeah I like the Jen mentioned like low-grade waste heat you know there's plenty of sources of that all over the place like if you can run your system on that that's probably an advantage. I don't know I guess the other thought is you know some of these power plants are going to be decommissioned at some point maybe we can at least use some of the infrastructure if nothing else you know to help with some of these DAC systems. They're going to have to be pretty big I think. I mean we're talking like gigatons of capture so I mean we could do it distributed but I'm I'm guessing we also want some big centralized plant scale things as well so if we can kind of build on some retrofitting and you know infrastructure that's already out there then that's probably going to help.",

So on one hand if you have a DAC process that needs water it's potentially available but it's it's a very complicated social political question as well.",

            "transcript": "I don't know if you're familiar there was a report that came out I guess it was probably last year it was called the 2035 report or something like that but what it was saying is that it is potentially it's possible to get to 90% renewables by 2035 and what that would look like. And so we did an evaluation in my group and looked at the age of the current fleet. The the coal fleet in the United States over 53% of the coal-fired power plants are beyond their expiration date already today. So they're probably not going to be around you know after the next decade fingers crossed I guess. And then the natural gas fleet in the US if you look at the age they're pretty much going to last until mid-century unless we retire them early. And if we do do increased penetration of renewables in the grid then we're going to have to retire them early. In fact that's what it it requires us to do and that leaves behind all these stranded assets. So Catherine I feel like you you hit the nail on the head. I think it's a really important concept to say because because what we end up getting is mis-messaging. I gave a talk on this back in 2018 and in a really broad audience and I said what is it going to take to capture a million tons of CO2 from the air it's going to take a power plant on the order of 300 to 500 megawatts. It's a super generalization to say that. The leading technologies today 80% of the energy is thermal only 20% is electric so you you have to kind of it's nuanced when you look at it and there's a lot of ways to make heat and certainly not all of that is electric. So but the problem with that statement that I made is that now you get people messaging of okay to get to a gigaton we have to multiply that times a thousand. And then you get communities saying well how are we going to increase renewable penetration if we need those renewables for direct air capture. And then you get these things competing. And I and I don't they don't have to compete. The strategy Catherine that you just pointed out exploiting stranded resources like natural gas that are going to last through mid-century that may only be running 10% of the time for base load could be a perfect segue into powering some of the DAC that we need at scale. So I would urge you guys to keep that conversation going. I think it's really interesting.",

There's a lot of nice synergy when you look at a big power plant and a DAC system because you basically have this source of like steam pressurized air you know components other things that like integrate really nicely with DAC and so it seems like there's a lot of potential cost savings and also performance improvement like for example we're looking at taking like pressurized air off of a compressor from natural gas and sending it through DAC and you're looking at like 20 times the partial pressure now of CO2.",
