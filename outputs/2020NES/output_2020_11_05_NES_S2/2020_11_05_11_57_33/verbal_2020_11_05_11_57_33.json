Um, a couple other things. It also helps with ocean acidification. So if you're removing CO2, it also helps the pH, which could be really helpful for certain marine environments. Um, and then just from like I'm an engineer, so from that perspective, uh, if you're dealing with like a really dense working fluid instead of the air, it could also have some advantages.

There's not much you're going to be able to do in terms of changing the intrinsic entropy of CO2 absorbing inside a porous material unless it can somehow still be mobile um and is less confined to the surface. So maybe you could do something but if the in a responsive absorbent uh an absorbent that structure changes in response to absorption or in particular the dynamics of some sort of organic functional group or something change in response to an absorbent in a way that confers some type of entropic advantage um that would drive more CO2 into the material even at a lower enthalpy window if there's potential opportunities there that haven't really been explored.

And there are actually a lot of really old electrochemical methods to to um to address that that that that that kind of process. So that would be um, you know, something that nobody's even thinking about. Um, you know, especially like in the field of of carbon capture that uh would be a way to electrify the the carbon dioxide for for process for a more organic chemistry type application, right? And a lot of these these molecules that people make that are kind of less than 100 grams per mole or so, um uh are are molecules that can be are that are commodity chemicals, right? They're produced on huge scale.

Um and and Chris, I know you have to go, I don't know, he's going to go teach I think in a little bit. So I'll I'll be closing us up. But um but I think it's also important to distinguish between the different technologies of direct air capture. Uh they're all very different, you know, and so if it's an electro swing approach and you can turn it off and on and you can you don't need thermal energy in order to regenerate, that's very flexible and a benefit of that kind of an approach. If it's a you know, a global thermostat or a climeworks type of an approach where you can use low grade heat or even maybe coupling really low grade heat to heat pumps uh is an opportunity where you could couple to things like waste heat uh which is a lot of what climeworks is doing today and and if you're interested in that, we wrote a paper on that uh just came out in the spring. coupling to low grade heat from nuclear and also geothermal. Uh but when you take a carbon engineering type approach uh where they require 900 degrees C heat for regeneration, it's not so easy to imagine coupling that. You can't couple that to low there's no such thing as low grade 900 degrees C heat. Waste heat at 900 degrees C. So in that case you do need a dedicated plant that produces thermal energy and uh electric energy for that process. And so I think one thing that I try and do in the messaging of direct air capture is that not all direct air capture technologies are created equal and they're going to couple to energy resources in different ways uh and they're going to be in that case cited in different ways. So the concept of putting a direct air capture plant anywhere is a bit of a short sighted view. And maybe that even we can transition into something like that too and talking about that. And it's not just the energy. Um you know, but there some of these approaches do require water. Some are net producers of water. Some require expensive feed stocks for the materials to actually do the separation. Are have you in your in your work uh have you guys given some consideration of those types of things outside of the energy requirements. ",

But I think if we if we can think about it in a as you said in the social equity from the social equity standpoint of, you know, we've generated this waste and and how do we manage it. Um, I think that there's some interesting things that can come about there but and and I I do think ultimately it's it's going to be a developing a legislative framework that that that facilitates that though. And it has to be a global thing, right? What what works for the US, it's not fair to impose that on a developing country. Um, and and so there's there's it's a very multi-faceted uh uh problem. ",
