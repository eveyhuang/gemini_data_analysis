There's not one technology that's going to solve the carbon crisis. It's going to involve storage, it's going to involve point source capture, it's going to involve utilization and conversion. and and I think understanding the limits of if if this technology can be deployed in this geography, what are my what's my water resource availability. Uh and that that puts a cap on how much methanol I could produce as an example.",

For example, we also did some calculation. If using all the electricity from human being we generated, you cannot convert all the carbon dioxide we produced using electricity. So that's only one route that we can provide, right? For example, if if you have in some geological locations, you have access electricity, then we can probably utilize that. But that cannot represent all the efforts we we want to deal with carbon dioxide. We need more, much more than only electricity.",

            "transcript": "Just to kind of add to the idea of electrifying the the CO2 capture component. Um, you know, we've been thinking about kind of things that bind carbon dioxide kind of from a zero order perspective. Um, and to us in a way, you know, once something is bound to a carbon dioxide, it's a carboxylate, it's a carboxylic acid that's lost a proton. there's just a lot of organic chemistry that could be happening there to convert um a bound carbon dioxide to an alcohol, for example, by homologation by adding one C1 and so, you know, kind of an off the wall um uh idea of electrifying the carbon dioxide capture component uh would be to just have a large organic structure in which you can generate a nucleophile, bind the CO2 and then convert that carboxylic acid to whatever you need. And there are actually a lot of really old electrochemical methods to to um to address that that that that that kind of process. So that would be um, you know, something that nobody's even thinking about. Um, you know, especially like in the field of of carbon capture that uh would be a way to electrify the the carbon dioxide for for process for a more organic chemistry type application, right? And a lot of these these molecules that people make that are kind of less than 100 grams per mole or so, um uh are are molecules that can be are that are commodity chemicals, right? They're produced on huge scale. So if we can find a way to to just leverage this this this carbon dioxide capture interface with an organic nucleophile converted to something that that that that is useful on scale, you know, I think that would be a great opportunity to to kind of reinvent the way carbon capture is even thought about, right? Because you no longer have to release it, you no longer have to worry about storage and you'd actually be making something valuable directly. Um, just a wild thought out there.",

Of course the rate is low. The process is not intensified of course not same as the chemical engineering plants but uh of course that's one technology pathway that is I think that's possible of using water as a proton source.

You don't do thermal desalination or you prefer to do reverse osmosis as a system because it's thermodynamically favorable. Um, but the idea being a technology may be viable if you take hybrid approaches where for instance what we're looking at is how can we look at systems where we combine um uh we may make thermal desalination and solar viable if we look at producing two valuable outputs like power and water. Um, so in the same vein, if we look at combining electrolysis with something other valuable product.",

And you're and you're doing it because you're trying you're combining like Kelsey said, it's a hybrid approach. And it's like to get maximum, you know, impact, you can think of strategies where um these approaches can work together rather than competing. Their their collectiveness can be, you know, it's additive and so not competitive.

Um, and so I've been kind of thinking along those lines and trying to brainstorm like maybe nuclear could do the same or, you know, maybe we need to do renewables, but then those have some issues too with like land space and other issues. So I don't know, I'm just kind of throwing that out there as a thought. Um, has anybody kind of looked into that, like, you know, power integration and how we're going to run all this DAC?",
