There's not one technology that's going to solve the the carbon crisis. It's going to involve storage, it's going to involve point source capture, it's going to involve utilization and conversion and and I think understanding the limits of if if this technology can be deployed in this geography, what are my what's my water resource availability and that that puts a cap on how much methanol I could produce as an example but",

For example we also did some calculation if you're using all the electricity from human being we generated you cannot convert all the carbon dioxide we produced using electricity. So that's only one route that we can provide right? For example if if you have in some geological locations you have access electricity then we can probably utilize that route but that cannot represent all the efforts we we want to deal with carbon dioxide. We need more much more than only electricity.",

            "transcript": "Just to kind of add to the idea of electrifying the the CO2 capture component. You know we've been thinking about kind of things that bind carbon dioxide kind of from a zero order perspective and to us in a way you know once something is bound to a carbon dioxide it's a carboxylate it's a carboxylic acid that's lost a proton and there's just a lot of organic chemistry that could be happening there to convert a bound carbon dioxide to an alcohol for example by homologation by adding one C1 and so you know kind of an off the wall idea of electrifying the carbon dioxide capture component would be to just have a larger organic structure in which you can generate a nucleophile bind the CO2 and then convert that carboxylic acid to whatever you need and there are actually a lot of really old electrochemical methods to to to address that that that that that kind of process so that would be you know something that nobody's even thinking about you know especially like in the field of of carbon capture that would be a way to electrify the the carbon dioxide process for a for a more organic chemistry type application right? And a lot of these these molecules that people make that are kind of less than 100 grams per mole or so are are molecules that can be are that are commodity chemicals right they're produced on huge scale. So if we can find a way to to just leverage this this this carbon dioxide capture interface with an organic nucleophile converted to something that that that that is useful on scale you know I think that would be a great opportunity to to reinvent the way carbon capture is even thought about right? Because you no longer have to release it you no longer have to worry about storage and you'd actually be making something valuable directly. Um just a wild thought out there.",

Of course the rate is low the process is not intensified of course not same as the chemical engineering plants but of course that's one technology pathway that is I think that's possible of using water as a proton source.

You don't do thermal desalination or you prefer to do reverse osmosis as a system because it's thermodynamically favorable. The idea being a technology may be viable if you take hybrid approaches where for instance what we're looking at is how can we look at systems where we combine we may make thermal desalination and solar viable if we look at producing two viable outputs like power and water. So in the same vein if we look at the production of two valuable commodities at once electrolysis which I think electrolysis is very efficient from my understanding it's a cost barrier and a lifetime issue of these cells but that may be dated in terms of my understanding of where electrolysis is. But if we can look at combining electrolysis with something other valuable product it may... My name is Kelsey Hatzell um ion conductors just to work through here... hydrogen... not treatment trains is what we say in desalination but hybrid systems.",

            "transcript": "I wonder too if anybody's given any thought there's a lot of kind of companies emerging today that are looking at biomass waste and the conversion of biomass waste for hydrogen. Charm is one of them, Clean Energy Solutions, LanzaTech to some extent. But these these companies you know one of the things and and you might categorize this as BECCS a little bit. And so we we're familiar with things like blue hydrogen and green hydrogen but in the case of if you're using a biomass waste to produce hydrogen and in the production of that hydrogen you you separate out the CO2 and you store it you have the potential of producing negative hydrogen. And I think that you know that's something that's kind of new and I don't know if that's something you guys have given any thought to as an alternative source of hydrogen and it is a way of taking water out of the air because you're essentially using and exploiting photosynthesis right and CO2 of course. And there are some companies that are kind of thinking about this but not selling it in that way. But that's interesting. It's also just regional so you have to be careful because how much biomass waste is there out there? You know there's no silver bullet. But a little seed I want to plant if you haven't been thinking about that.",

But you do it because you're trying to maximize the carbon storage right? And you're and you're doing it because you're trying you're combining like Kelsey said it's a hybrid approach and it's like to get maximum you know impact you can think of strategies where these approaches can work together rather than competing. Their their collectiveness can be you know it's additive and so not competitive. But I think it's it is interesting to kind of bring bring different pieces together to try and achieve maximum impact.",

And so I've been kind of thinking along those lines and trying to brainstorm like maybe nuclear could do the same or you know maybe we need to do renewables but then those have some issues too with like land space and other issues so I don't know I'm just kind of throwing that out there as a thought.
