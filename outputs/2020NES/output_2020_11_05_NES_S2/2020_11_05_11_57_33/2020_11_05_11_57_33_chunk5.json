Um for direct air air air capture, but something that's been on my on on on my mind for a while has been um kind of touching um with what Matt said, um kind of the the goal of the the the the the capture chemistry. And so for example for uh for a NASA type application when you try to actually scrub 100% um of the CO2 from from the air or most of it, you know, um, you know, the the thermodynamic requirements for that would be different than if you're just trying to um um um uh load up your your your your your sorbent, right? Because you're just um the most uh thermodynamically favorable process there would be to just skim a little bit of of of of CO2 um as you're flowing a large amount of of air. So I guess one of the one of the things that uh we've been thinking about is just the actual application.",

But then you pay the the the the the price on the other side of of of release, right? But um, you know, if you can get away with with actually having a large amount of substrate with a low yielding reaction if you want to think about it in in in terms of that then um you you can have um uh a low price to pay for for for for for the capture that might make sense on on on on the other side of of of release. So um I guess having some numbers, I think would be would be good for you to kind of know what kind of parameter space you're working in.",

So you are dead on correct and I I think it's well stated.",

            "transcript": "In in terms of a question or a big idea for the group, I want uh there was some discussion around this earlier. Uh I'd like to circle back to which is we we think a lot about capture and we think a lot about utilization, storage, conversion. And I think from a basic science perspective as well as from an engineering perspective, that we need to blend that interface better and come up with new technologies, processes, systems that can integrate those two processes so that it's not I've done my capture, here's your CO2, put it somewhere or convert it into something. And and I think this will feed into the the need for distributed CO2 capture as well, right? Like Kelsey said, I think we can think about point source capture, storage, utilization. I I um I think we we have a good understanding of how to think about that because there's been quite a bit of work in that area. And so, you know, the nascent and emerging field of DAC, I think presents some new opportunities and challenges that where we need some some new basic science.",

Uh so to bridging the um capture and uh conversion is not necessary only related with the uh capacity matching. That's easy. You can build up uh you can calculate easily what's the capture rate and what's the the conversion rate then you can you can design the size of your reactors. But there are a lot of actually details things or, you know, engineering issues or scientific problems that we still need to solve um uh to to to bridge them together for a integrated device.",

            "transcript": "One thing I'll echo too is I I recognize that a lot of what everybody's trying to do is thinking about fundamental research and advancing that. But I think it is also really important to understand um the just overarching, you know, bigger picture too. So like in the United States today, if we do a lot of separation of CO2 and we deploy it and we get it at scale, one of the one of the barriers is that we don't have the infrastructure to move the CO2 around. Like site to site it it's it's pretty well known that if you're moving around on the order of 700,000 tons of CO2 from a site that that pipeline infrastructure is cheaper than trucking it. You know, about that about that scale. And so we just don't have a lot of infrastructure for moving CO2 around in the US. And if we're thinking about capture and utilization, that is an opportunity so that we don't have to build all of that pipe pipeline network. But if you're converting it to something like methanol, you know, something that can be easily moved and we know how to do it pretty pretty well, you do have to ask the questions where where does the hydrogen come from?",

            "transcript": "Uh there are actually I I can have a a great answer here. There are actually two routes you can get hydrogen. One is uh for example if you're doing the CO2 hydrogenation using thermal catalysis, the hydrogen nowadays majority of them coming from uh uh methane reforming, right? Uh that still give you give you you consume the fossil fuel, you produce CO2. But there is also uh the technology uh uh we have been, you know, exploring for a long time that is using electricity for water splitting. Uh now select the the the not select the the efficiency can be very high actually to up to 80% converting electricity to hydrogen to hydrogen. Uh and with the price of the electricity coming down uh, you know, in the future, it can be more attractive. That's one route. Another route is um directly electrifying carbon dioxide into the liquid fuels or other type of fuels. That doesn't involve molecular hydrogen but they still use the protons that is coming from water, you're dumping electrons uh using electrocatalysis into carbon dioxide coupling with the protons from water, you can also directly generate uh you know, formic acid, methanol, ethanol and so on. There is also a field that is uh we are working on uh in terms of uh not directly mixing CO2 with molecular hydrogen and cap like that. But uh you know, dumping CO2 onto the surface of the catalyst using electricity to to to reduce that.",
