            "transcript": "a system that's stable to air, right? For direct air capture, but something that's been on my on my mind for a while has been kind of to chime in with what Matt said, kind of the the goal of the the the the capture chemistry. And so for example for a for a NASA type application when you're trying to actually scrub 100% of the CO2 from from the air or most of it, you know, the the thermodynamic requirements for that would be different than if you're just trying to load up your your your your your sorbent, right? Because you're just the most thermodynamically favorable process there would be to just skim a little bit of of of of CO2 as you're flowing a large amount of of air. So I guess one of the one of the things that we've been thinking about is just the actual application, right? So are you trying to have the most thermodynamically favorable process or are you trying to just deplete the the the the stream entirely, right? And because the the the requirements will change based on what what it is that you're trying to do. And so we've we've been kind of thinking about some of those those those those calculations and it's it's really interesting, you know, if you if you're trying to do full full depletion you need to have a stronger binder, right? But then you pay the the the the price on the other side of of of release, right? But you know if you can get away with with actually having a large amount of substrate with a low yielding reaction if you want to think about it in in in terms of that then you you can have a a low price to pay for for for for the capture that might make sense on on on the other side of of of release. So I guess having some numbers I think would be would be good for you to kind of know what kind of parameter space you're working in.",

And and I would also say that you're trading off operating costs for capital costs by how efficiently you use your material. So you are dead on correct and I think it's well stated.",

            "transcript": "In in terms of a question or a big idea for the group, there was some discussion around this earlier that I'd like to circle back to, which is we we think a lot about capture and we think a lot about utilization and storage, conversion, and I think from a basic science perspective as well as from an engineering perspective, that we need to blend that interface better and come up with new technologies, processes, systems that can integrate those two processes so that it's not I've done my capture, here's your CO2, put it somewhere or convert it into something. And and I think this will feed into the the need for distributed CO2 capture as well, right? Like Kelsey said, I think we can think about point source capture, storage, utilization. I think we we have a good understanding of how to think about that because there's been quite a bit of work in that area. And so you know the nascent and emerging field of DAC I think presents some new opportunities and challenges that where we need some some new basic science.",

            "transcript": "I completely agree with what Matt just mentioned. I have something to add on to his comment is we are we recently launched an EFI program is focused on bridging the capture and conversion modular device together. This is like what Matt just mentioned, you can do the separation, you can do the separation and conversion separately, that's fine. But in some of the specific applications, for example, a localized chemical production, you can actually integrate them into a how to say, an integrated device that you have the for example flue gas in, you have electricity in, and you directly produce the chemical compounds you want. So to bridging the capture and conversion is not necessarily only related with the capacity matching. That's easy, you can build up, you can calculate easily what's the capture rate and then what's the the conversion rate then you can you can design the size of your reactors. But there are a lot of other scientific issue and engineering issue inside. For example, what is the delivery, let's say, of course you you want to have higher purity as possible, right? You want 100% purity of CO2 but that will be paying a price of cost. If your downstream conversion can tolerate some of the impurities inside, what's that? That can have some type of trade-off. You can I don't need to 100% purify my CO2. I have like if I can capture 50% of them, I can have enough efficiency to convert them. That might be better for you to say I I I want 100% pure of CO2 and so on. And also for let's say for a direct air capture or flue gas capture, there are also some impurities inside. What is the effect of these impurities on your conversion device? Is that will poison your catalyst or it will damage your selectivity or so? If not, we don't need to take care about that. If yes, we probably will include some of the devices in your purification system. So there are a lot of actually detailed things or you know engineering issues or scientific problems that we still need to solve to to bridge them together for an integrated device.",

            "transcript": "One thing I'll echo too is I I recognize that a lot of what everybody's trying to do is thinking about fundamental research and advancing that, but I think it is also really important to understand the just overarching, you know, bigger picture too. So like in the United States today, if we do a lot of separation of CO2 and we deploy it and we get it at scale, one of the one of the barriers is that we don't have the infrastructure to move the CO2 around. Like site to site, it it's it's pretty well known that if you're moving around on the order of 700,000 tons of CO2 from a site, that pipeline infrastructure is cheaper than trucking it, you know, about that about that scale. And so we just don't have a lot of infrastructure for moving CO2 around in the US. And if we're thinking about capture and utilization, that is an opportunity so that we don't have to build all of that pipeline network. But if you're converting it to something like methanol, you know, something that can be easily moved and we know how to do it pretty pretty well, you do have to ask the questions where does where does the hydrogen come from? And I think that a lot of when we think about utilization, whether it's a plastic or a chemical or a fuel, that bigger picture, that life cycle assessment piece, the fundamentals are important and we have to advance them, but we also have to recognize those boundary conditions on the bigger picture. And I just wonder if you've guys have thought about some of that as well, of the hydrogen piece if we're to utilize the CO2.",

            "transcript": "There are actually I can I can have a brief answer here. There are actually two routes you can get the hydrogen. One is for example if you're doing the CO2 hydrogenation using thermal catalysis, the hydrogen nowadays majority of them coming from methane reforming, right? That's still you consume the fossil fuel, you produce CO2. But there is also the technology we have been you know exploring for a long time that is using electricity for water splitting. Now the the the efficiency can be very high actually up to 80% converting electricity to hydrogen. And with the price of the electricity coming down you know in the future, it can be more attractive. That's one route. Another route is directly electrifying carbon dioxide into the liquid fuels or other type of fuels. That doesn't involve molecular hydrogen but it still use the protons that is coming from water. You're dumping electrons using electrocatalysis into carbon dioxide coupling with the protons from water, you can also directly generate you know formic acid, methanol, ethanol and so on. There is also a field that is we are working on in terms of not directly mixing CO2 with molecular hydrogen and catalyze that, but you know dumping CO2 onto the surface of catalyst using electricity to to to reduce that.",
