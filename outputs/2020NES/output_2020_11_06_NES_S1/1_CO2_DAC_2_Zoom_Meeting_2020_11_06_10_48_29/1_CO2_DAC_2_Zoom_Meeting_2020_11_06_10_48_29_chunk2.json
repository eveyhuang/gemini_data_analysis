And there are there are recently more and more interatomic potentials are being developed where you can actually in principle allow the bond breaking and charge transfer at the interfaces or at the surfaces for example. Those could be helpful but somewhere combining those two will be I would say really really great for a problem like this because it is my understanding with a lot of these different kind of materials just one method just simply does not do justice to the problem simply because if you are looking at thermodynamics DFT is really good but if you're looking at system sizes and nanocrystalline materials is sometimes not feasible in the realm of the computational power and often when you go into kinetics either is there is a scaling from what the DFT method you are using or you need to really run simulations at high temperature and then understand the mechanisms.",

            "transcript": "So I think we have about 15 minutes left and I want to try one other idea to stir some some different thinking. You know in a lot of engineered systems you have control over temperature pressure other parameters. One of the challenging things about direct air capture is you know we're we're stuck with 400 ppm CO2. But one of the things I haven't seen discussed a lot is if you imagine deploying direct air capture in different places around the world you could imagine having conditions that range from say minus 20 to 40 degrees C. So if you were asked to try to do something with CO2 at 400 ppm at minus 20 degrees C how would you think about doing that differently from you know the ambient conditions that we're normally used to thinking about indoors 25 degrees C you know 30% relative humidity. And similarly if you were designing a process that could operate in you know Oman in the middle of summer you know you you might be dealing with 35 40 degrees C ambient temperatures. So I just throw that out there as a way to maybe stir different ideas. This is a challenge where we're going to probably have 10 or 20 or 50 solutions that might be customized to different locations around the globe. So would you change your way of thinking if you were stuck working at minus 10 C or or 40 C? So I'll just throw that out there as a possible question.",

            "timestamp": "03:11-04:55",
            "transcript": "Chris my short answer to that is absolutely yes. So we've been looking at pathways to couple direct air capture with carbon mineralization specifically with the intent of trying to produce carbonates and one way to do that is to use conventional sorbents that are cheap so you could use amino acid solvents like sodium glycinate or even MEA and so you have a high concentration of carbonate ions that you can now react with your calcium or magnesium produce calcium magnesium carbonate have sufficiently high hydroxyl ions so you can regenerate your solvent. So you have a one pot process with internal recycling internal pH swinging. So that's so that really drives down the cost of capture and mineralization but it needs higher temperatures because of the thermodynamics of CO2 sorption because we're trying to couple sorption and crystallization. This is a process that would not work in very cold climates like if we're trying to do this in the arctic there simply is not going to be enough thermodynamic driving force for that. There are other approaches to couple mineralization so for example again if you're trying to feed CO2 to an algae pond depends again where that algae pond is going to be located if it's going to be located in a temperate region versus in a really cold climate. So cold climate is a real challenge and I am not entirely sure what subset of solutions can be deployed there but if you but I do think there are a set of solutions that can be deployed in more temperate and tropical regions. So that's my two cents on the thinking and we do a lot of thinking around this space so I'd be very keen on hearing what we can actually do in really cold regions.",

            "transcript": "I'd say from the perspective of like microporous adsorbents I think it's probably the opposite for just conventional absorption processes in that colder climates are probably a lot easier than hotter climates just in that in designing you can design binding sites that have much lower affinities for CO2 and still be able to achieve very high selectivities just because you have less thermal energy available so the Boltzmann distribution is going to favor CO2 going to you don't need as large of a delta E between different gas molecules to drive a lot of CO2 into a material. As the regeneration piece though that's less clear to me exactly how that changes. I think selectivity and capacity are a lot easier you can have weaker binding sites but whether or not that actually leads to benefits on the regeneration side when you're already colder I'd have to think a little bit more about. I guess if you're in a cold climate but you had some geothermal heat source or something readily available then you that might offer a lot of advantages.",

            "transcript": "Yeah actually I think that for electrochem it's a it's a really good question because I don't think it has been considered too much. I think that it will probably not affect the energetics too much because the potential is a really strong driving force but it will change all the different apparatus and the especially the solvent because most of the solvents that we use will probably solidify. So you might have to change the whole architecture to have something that is basically not solvent dependent like hopefully it's all immobilized and everything is just ionic without like a flowing solvent. So that's a really good question actually. It's a really good context for electrochemists to explore. I don't know if ionic liquids might be the best electrolyte then because they have a bigger range I don't know what their phase transition is.",

Is there other paths? So am I in the wrong breakout room for that discussion? There's no there's no ocean capture section so I'm just wondering maybe this is a discussion that fits.",
