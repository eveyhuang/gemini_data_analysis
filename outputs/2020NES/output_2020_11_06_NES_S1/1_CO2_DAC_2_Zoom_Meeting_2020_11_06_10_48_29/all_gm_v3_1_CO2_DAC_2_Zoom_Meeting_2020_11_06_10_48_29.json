In the context of direct air capture, how important are entropic contributions like in terms of the energetic input, should we even does it even make sense for us to think about engineering materials for from an entropic capture point of view or does it simply make sense for us to just think about trying to engineer the enthalpic component of it.

But like Chris said I think it is a very unexplored kind of area. It's less obvious to me I mean usually the enthalpy and entropy of absorption should be quite highly correlated because the more stronger the binding site you have for the gas the more constrained it is going to be on the surface and so there's usually not that much you can really do which is why maybe it makes sense just to focus on binding energy because the entropy is just going to kind of tag along. But that's where I think if you have more dynamic adsorbents or sorbents and things that respond and are not just inert materials but actually change in terms of the dynamics or structure as a function of CO2 partial pressure then you open up opportunities for thinking about engineering entropy.",

You know in a lot of engineered systems you have control over temperature pressure other parameters. One of the challenging things about direct air capture is you know we're we're stuck with 400 ppm CO2. But one of the things I haven't seen discussed a lot is if you imagine deploying direct air capture in different places around the world you could imagine having conditions that range from say minus 20 to 40 degrees C. So if you were asked to try to do something with CO2 at 400 ppm at minus 20 degrees C how would you think about doing that differently from you know the ambient conditions that we're normally used to thinking about indoors 25 degrees C you know 30% relative humidity. And similarly if you were designing a process that could operate in you know Oman in the middle of summer you know you you might be dealing with 35 40 degrees C ambient temperatures. So I just throw that out there as a way to maybe stir different ideas. This is a challenge where we're going to probably have 10 or 20 or 50 solutions that might be customized to different locations around the globe. So would you change your way of thinking if you were stuck working at minus 10 C or or 40 C? So I'll just throw that out there as a possible question.",

So we've been looking at pathways to couple direct air capture with carbon mineralization specifically with the intent of trying to produce carbonates and one way to do that is to use conventional sorbents that are cheap so you could use amino acid solvents like sodium glycinate or even MEA and so you have a high concentration of carbonate ions that you can now react with your calcium or magnesium produce calcium magnesium carbonate have sufficiently high hydroxyl ions so you can regenerate your solvent. So you have a one pot process with internal recycling internal pH swinging. So that's so that really drives down the cost of capture and mineralization but it needs higher temperatures because of the thermodynamics of CO2 sorption because we're trying to couple sorption and crystallization. This is a process that would not work in very cold climates like if we're trying to do this in the arctic there simply is not going to be enough thermodynamic driving force for that. There are other approaches to couple mineralization so for example again if you're trying to feed CO2 to an algae pond depends again where that algae pond is going to be located if it's going to be located in a temperate region versus in a really cold climate. So cold climate is a real challenge and I am not entirely sure what subset of solutions can be deployed there but if you but I do think there are a set of solutions that can be deployed in more temperate and tropical regions. So that's my two cents on the thinking and we do a lot of thinking around this space so I'd be very keen on hearing what we can actually do in really cold regions.",

As the regeneration piece though that's less clear to me exactly how that changes. I think selectivity and capacity are a lot easier you can have weaker binding sites but whether or not that actually leads to benefits on the regeneration side when you're already colder I'd have to think a little bit more about.
