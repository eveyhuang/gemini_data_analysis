What if you reduce the driving force for nitrogen, oxygen, water binding by doing some pre-separation? And now your mixture still had 400 ppm CO2 but you had lower driving force, lower thermodynamic activity of these high concentration species.",

There's less competition for side reactions, there's no nucleophilic attack, so it would be ideal so we don't have to come up with fancy chemistries anymore. We can use things that are cheaper. But I think Andrew had some ideas about O2 consumption at some point when we were discussing.",

One of the troubles we were running into because that was when we were talking about the whole capture and release mechanism where oxygen was causing a lot of problems for these competitive reactions that Xiao mentioned. The problem we were running into was just highly energy intensive to do that and we'd have to find some type of justification, you know we need ultra high pure oxygen for some other part of the process. Because if you're talking about cryogenics or membrane based separations and even so you'll still end up with ppm levels of oxygen so then you have to have some type of scavenger to remove all of that. So it's just it depends how much oxygen you want to remove but it's definitely on the table.",

I know it's received kind of some attention and some modeling studies and I think some demonstrations maybe with some anion resins or something but I'm not exactly very familiar with it. But I just wonder if there's significant enough swings in humidity and just kind of what the thermodynamics of that type of process are like. I think the general idea as far as I understand it is that you have some type of absorbent that binds CO2 very effectively in the absence of water and then humidity increases and water displaces the CO2 but it's not actually something I know that much about.",

It still is a bit of a niche topic so if somebody had a creative idea I think that would be interesting. One of the challenges becomes when you're after you've desorbed under humidity to reabsorb you've got to dry your sorbent. There's a lot of energy associated with that water removal. So tuning hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of those materials is I think an active research area. But that's definitely a mode that we should think about.",

That's one idea but actually this may sound a little crazy here but if the problem is water this may sound sort of crazy but what if you just water split it? Because I don't know which one's more energetically intensive if you just switch it or if you just split the water and just make it into a gas if you have tiny amounts of it. I don't know if that's been done but if I have tiny little amounts on an absorbent and then you maybe just raise the which is actually not that compared to CO2 capture it's not that high the potential for water splitting you just raise it to one volt and then you just break down the water and then produce a little bit of side gases. Might not be feasible at all but it's just an idea.",
