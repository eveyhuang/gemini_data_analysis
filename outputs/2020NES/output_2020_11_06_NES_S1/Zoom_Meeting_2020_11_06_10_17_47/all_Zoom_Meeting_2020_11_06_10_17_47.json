So, um, thermal regeneration, you know, we may we may need to think about some other mechanisms that aid in thermal regeneration. So, um, you know, some of those sorbents like zeolites, you know, they they require significantly high regeneration temperatures and like ionic liquid capsules definitely lowers that. Um, but still, can we think about other ways to bring energy into the system for regeneration? So, um, I mean, the things that I have in mind and you can I guess it's not really thinking outside of the box too much, but you know, microwave radiation, radio frequency radiation, or even plasma assisted regeneration, um, Sharma mentioned electrochemical regeneration.

That's a little bit different from electrochemical capture in the liquid phase is that for CO2, there's a reaction and then that makes your energy of regeneration very high. So if there's some way that we can use some sort of weaker affinity that would still have selectivity, that would make a regeneration a lot more efficient. So like in the liquid phase, you have these weaker interactions. So your potential swing that you have to, your free energy swing is a lot less. But then for CO2, and then maybe it's a catch 22 and can't solve it because the concentration is so low for direct air capture. But if there's some way that we can think of to use other mechanisms other than like a reaction that captures the CO2 and changes it and then regenerates it, it would be more efficient for electrochemistry.

And I also want to mention too, don't forget that we can calculate the minimum work for any separation process, um, which is the thermodynamic minimum. Uh, and and so one way to think about that is that final concentration of CO2. If you're starting off at the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere and you're getting it to say 99% purity because you want to transport the CO2 in a liquid phase. But suppose that instead of transporting it in liquid phase, you want to use it and convert it as a feedstock to something else. So I would ask the question, what is the lowest purity that you actually need to get the CO2 to as the feedstock? Are you crystallizing it, you know, mineralizing it like Grishma just mentioned, are you turning it into a fuel? Uh, how low could you actually go to get the conversions you need to that to that X? And I think that that is an interesting parameter that's not often exploited because so many of us just look at thinking about transporting the CO2, but you might not have to.

I'm David Kwabi from University of Michigan, Mechanical Engineering. So, uh, if you do the minimum work calculation for capturing CO2 from air to one bar, it looks pretty, uh, promising. It's like 20 kilojoules per mole or something like that. Um, but in reality, it's going to be you're going to have to spend a lot more energy, um, because you have a massive concentration factor to deal with. But if you want it, for example, to this is like, you know, say do jet fuel instead. Um, let's say we're not we're not going to get electric planes anytime soon. So, um, let's say your target was jet fuel and you wanted to use microbes like algae to do it. You actually don't need to go go all the way to 100%. Um, they can be pretty effective at like a couple percent, like 2%, 5%. So you can envision a situation where you're taking CO2 from air, but you're feeding it to algae, which are, you know, maybe not effective at 400 ppm, but super effective at 25%. Um, and then you're you have a useful end product as a result. So it kind of let it, you know, you're a little less constrained in terms of how high you need to go in concentration factor, um, but you're still effective, um, at doing something useful. So that's a sort of an end application driven, uh, design of of your DAC system.",

Any other hierarchies or architectures that people want to talk about? I really liked the concept that Burcu, like that you had mentioned about, um, when we think about membranes, we often think, well, that doesn't work for direct air capture because you don't have a driving force. But when you think about a contained liquid membrane, you're combining, um, approaches. It's it's your combining something like absorption with a membrane separation process and and maybe there's benefits of thinking about the heat transfer across different systems, whether it's a packed bed or a membrane or a fluid in a in a packed bed.

So the concept being you have something that, you know, has a high affinity to absorb onto a metallic surface, then you might be able to use what's used in the catalytic world as, uh, spillover effect where essentially is a sync that you absorb onto the nanoparticle, then spill over onto the membrane or you're locally concentrated at that interface.

        "transcript": "Is that directed more at me or at Andrew? Sorry. I think we combined it. I took your idea and used, I don't think you implied that it was an electrochemical approach. I think you were saying, you know, there's a thermal transition or just a concentration driven transition. But I teased out the idea of, could you actually have that phase change induced electrochemically? Is what I kind of added to that or questioned about it. Yeah, I think that's an interesting approach that I hadn't really considered before. What I was referring to is more just a phase transition that's induced by absorption or absorption in this orbit material. So usually some type of structural phase transition or could also be, what specifically is coming into mind are certain metal organic frameworks that adopt rigid structures that have covalently attached flexible kind of amine groups on their surface that can bind chemically to CO2. And those amine groups are very dynamic and kind of moving all around in the absence of carbon dioxide. But when you get enough carbon dioxide such that you surpass a certain threshold partial pressure, it induces a phase transition in the amines so that they basically undergo effectively like a precipitation reaction and you form chains of ammonium carbonate. And so the thermodynamics of that phase transition are basically the opposite of the thermodynamics of CO2 absorption. And so that can reduce basically the overall net enthalpy change while you're still achieving a really high capacity and selectivity. So that's one example that comes to mind. There's other types of demonstrations with flexible metal organic frameworks where you have basically structures that are non-porous. And then when you achieve a certain threshold pressure of CO2 or gas on the outside of the framework, they expand to accommodate the gas. And that expansion again has the opposite thermodynamics, opposite enthalpy entropy change as absorption of the gas. And so that can provide some benefits in terms of minimizing temperature fluctuations during absorption and desorption. And I think similar types of things are possible in ionic liquids with precipitation reactions. But I think it's kind of been underexplored phase space in general. And so there's probably more opportunities for other types of mechanisms like Andrew suggested where you could have benefits and access properties that you wouldn't be able to have if you just have a simple kind of absorption or absorption process.",

So we have a recent paper looking at how we can use guanidian bases. This is in collaboration with some of the folks at Oakridge National Lab, where you have this, we actually sorb it in a liquid phase and then you form carbonate bonds, which cause the sorbent, the solvent has now become a solid, a crystallized solid. So then you crystallize it out and it has a much lower temperature of regeneration compared to the conventional carbonate. It's a water heavy system, but then when you work on systems like that, there are all these unconventional crystallization pathways and absorption pathways and coupling mechanisms that really open up new areas of fundamental science. So maybe direct air capture can serve as a pathway for unlocking some of those basic science questions too.",

Because then you don't have any counter ions. So the architecture of making it might be also like a challenge itself. So like a lot of the absorbent systems that are being done electrochemically now, they're done with some sort of liquid phase. But I feel like from the discussions, it sounds like if you can get rid of that liquid and have a direct gas stream passing by, if we can do that, that's more efficient, except you always need this sort of ionic conductivity. So how do you design something like that with new materials? It's a little bit of a challenge. So few folks have done it a little bit using polymeric materials and then using membranes like fuel cells and stuff. But if you want to have some sort of crystal, you have to impregnate it with something that has a counter ion. So that becomes like a design challenge as well.",

And that uh liberates the CO2 and you're essentially swinging between a carbonate and a bicarbonate in this process. Now, but then you now have a quaternary ammonium polymer that's in the humid humid state and in order to reabsorb and to restart the next cycle, you've got to remove a lot of water from a highly charged polar surface. And there's significant energy associated with doing that. And there's also significant kinetics associated with doing that and cycling the material quickly.",
