So in a microporous sorbent for example, rather than like the classical zeolite that maintains its exact structure even when it becomes in contact with CO2. If CO2 can induce a change in your adsorbent, then if the thermodynamics of that phase transition or change in the adsorbent are in the right way, they can mitigate some of the for example exothermic heat of absorption or endothermic heat of desorption for removing CO2. And I know people have done a little bit of similar types of things in the context of ionic liquids with looking at either precipitation reactions or some type of phase transition that can be coupled to CO2 absorption in an ionic liquid that just gives you another kind of knob to tune to try to access different thermodynamics than you would have if you were just focused on conventional kind of absorption or adsorption.",

        "transcript": "Yeah, I think that's an interesting approach that I hadn't really considered before. What I was referring to is more just a phase transition that's induced by adsorption or absorption in this sorbent material. So usually some type of structural phase transition or could also be some the what specifically is coming to mind are certain metal-organic frameworks that adopt rigid structures that have covalently attached flexible kind of amine groups on their surface that can bind chemically to CO2. And those amine groups are very dynamic and kind of moving all around in the absence of carbon dioxide, but when you get enough carbon dioxide such that you surpass a certain threshold partial pressure, it induces a phase transition in the amines so that they basically undergo what's effectively like a precipitation reaction and you form chains of ammonium carbamate. And so the thermodynamics of that phase transition are basically the opposite of the thermodynamics of CO2 absorption. And so that can reduce basically the overall net enthalpy change while you're still achieving a really high capacity and selectivity. So that's one example that comes to mind. There's other types of demonstrations with flexible metal-organic frameworks where you have basically structures that are non-porous and then when you achieve a certain threshold pressure of CO2 or gas on the outside of the framework, they expand to accommodate the gas. And that expansion again has the opposite thermodynamics, opposite enthalpy and entropy change as absorption of the gas. And so that could provide some benefits in terms of minimizing temperature fluctuations during absorption and desorption. And I think similar types of things are possible in ionic liquids with like precipitation reactions, but I think it's kind of an underexplored phase space in general and so there's probably more opportunities for other types of mechanisms like Andrew suggested where you could have benefits in accessing properties that you wouldn't be able to have if you just have a simple kind of absorption or adsorption process.",

So we have a recent paper looking at how we can use guanidinium bases, this is in collaboration with some of the folks at Oak Ridge National Lab, where you have this we actually sorb it in a liquid phase and then you form carbonate bonds which cause the sorbent, the solvent now become a solid, a crystallized solid. So then you crystallize it out and it has a much lower temperature of regeneration compared to the conventional carbonate. It's a water-heavy system, but then when you work on systems like that, there are all there are all these unconventional crystallization pathways and absorption pathways and coupling mechanisms that really open up new areas of fundamental science. So maybe direct air capture can serve as a pathway for unlocking some of those basic science questions too.",

Because then you don't have any counter-ions. So the architecture of making it might be also like a challenge itself. So like a lot of the adsorbent systems that are being done electrochemically now, they're done with some sort of liquid phase, but I feel like from the discussions, it sounds like if you can get rid of that liquid and have a direct gas stream passing by, you can do that, that's more efficient except you always need this sort of ionic conductivity.

One of the troubles we were running into because that was when we were talking about the whole capture and release mechanism where oxygen was causing a lot of problems for these competitive reactions that Xiao mentioned. The problem we were running into was just highly energy intensive to do that and we'd have to find some type of justification, you know we need ultra high pure oxygen for some other part of the process. Because if you're talking about cryogenics or membrane based separations and even so you'll still end up with ppm levels of oxygen so then you have to have some type of scavenger to remove all of that.

One of the challenges becomes when you're after you've desorbed under humidity to reabsorb you've got to dry your sorbent. There's a lot of energy associated with that water removal.

Because I don't know which one's more energetically intensive if you just switch it or if you just split the water and just make it into a gas if you have tiny amounts of it. I don't know if that's been done but if I have tiny little amounts on an absorbent and then you maybe just raise the which is actually not that compared to CO2 capture it's not that high the potential for water splitting you just raise it to one volt and then you just break down the water and then produce a little bit of side gases.
