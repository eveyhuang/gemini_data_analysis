That's a little bit different from electrochemical capture in the liquid phase is that for CO2, there's a reaction and then that makes your energy of regeneration very high. So if there's some way that we can use some sort of weaker affinity that would still have selectivity, that would make a regeneration a lot more efficient. So like in the liquid phase, you have these weaker interactions. So your potential swing that you have to, your free energy swing is a lot less. But then for CO2, and then maybe it's a catch 22 and can't solve it because the concentration is so low for direct air capture. But if there's some way that we can think of to use other mechanisms other than like a reaction that captures the CO2 and changes it and then regenerates it, it would be more efficient for electrochemistry.

It's like 20 kilojoules per mole or something like that. Um, but in reality, it's going to be you're going to have to spend a lot more energy, um, because you have a massive concentration factor to deal with. But if you want it, for example, to this is like, you know, say do jet fuel instead. Um, let's say we're not we're not going to get electric planes anytime soon. So, um, let's say your target was jet fuel and you wanted to use microbes like algae to do it. You actually don't need to go go all the way to 100%. Um, they can be pretty effective at like a couple percent, like 2%, 5%. So you can envision a situation where you're taking CO2 from air, but you're feeding it to algae, which are, you know, maybe not effective at 400 ppm, but super effective at 25%. Um, and then you're you have a useful end product as a result. So it kind of let it, you know, you're a little less constrained in terms of how high you need to go in concentration factor, um, but you're still effective, um, at doing something useful.

I think you were saying, you know, there's a thermal transition or just a concentration driven transition. But I teased out the idea of, could you actually have that phase change induced electrochemically? Is what I kind of added to that or questioned about it. Yeah, I think that's an interesting approach that I hadn't really considered before. What I was referring to is more just a phase transition that's induced by absorption or absorption in this orbit material. So usually some type of structural phase transition or could also be, what specifically is coming into mind are certain metal organic frameworks that adopt rigid structures that have covalently attached flexible kind of amine groups on their surface that can bind chemically to CO2. And those amine groups are very dynamic and kind of moving all around in the absence of carbon dioxide. But when you get enough carbon dioxide such that you surpass a certain threshold partial pressure, it induces a phase transition in the amines so that they basically undergo effectively like a precipitation reaction and you form chains of ammonium carbonate. And so the thermodynamics of that phase transition are basically the opposite of the thermodynamics of CO2 absorption. And so that can reduce basically the overall net enthalpy change while you're still achieving a really high capacity and selectivity. So that's one example that comes to mind. There's other types of demonstrations with flexible metal organic frameworks where you have basically structures that are non-porous. And then when you achieve a certain threshold pressure of CO2 or gas on the outside of the framework, they expand to accommodate the gas. And that expansion again has the opposite thermodynamics, opposite enthalpy entropy change as absorption of the gas. And so that can provide some benefits in terms of minimizing temperature fluctuations during absorption and desorption. And I think similar types of things are possible in ionic liquids with precipitation reactions. But I think it's kind of been underexplored phase space in general. And so there's probably more opportunities for other types of mechanisms like Andrew suggested where you could have benefits and access properties that you wouldn't be able to have if you just have a simple kind of absorption or absorption process.
