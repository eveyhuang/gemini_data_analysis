So I think a lot of it has been on this type of quinone type chemistries that have a certain potential and stability and then we were thinking and I think it's something that my group from the more polymeric type perspective would be interested in is to see if there are some other chemistries like nitrogen heteroatoms that when you do the redox you can actually have it at higher overpotentials and less parasitic side reactions. So that was one of the things that we were sort of interested in.",

You'll hear me talk about ionic liquids a lot so that's what we work on but we're also looking at encapsulated ionic liquids. And I think one of the issues there is we have to worry about the pressure drop and think about alternative ways how to bring energy in and out smoothly in these materials. So thermal regeneration you know we may need to think about some other mechanisms that aid in thermal regeneration. So some of the sorbents like zeolites they require significantly high regeneration temperatures and like ionic liquid capsules definitely lowers that but still can we think about other ways to bring energy into the system for regeneration. So the things that I have in mind I guess it's not really thinking outside of the box too much but microwave irradiation, radio frequency irradiation or even plasma assisted regeneration. Xiao mentioned electrochemical regeneration. We can certainly make these capsule shells to be conductive and that's how we can bring that in.",

            "transcript": "I think the one thing I think that after some breakout discussions that I was sort of thinking about the electrochemical capture CO2 that's a little bit different from electrochemical capture in the liquid phase is for CO2 there's a reaction and then that makes your energy of regeneration very high. So if there's some way that we can use some sort of weaker affinity that would still have selectivity that would make your regeneration a lot more efficient. So like in the liquid phase you have these weaker interactions so your potential swing that you have to your free energy swing is a lot less but then for CO2 and then maybe it's a catch-22 and we can't solve it because the concentration is so low for direct air capture but if there's some way that we can think of to use other mechanisms other than like a reaction that captures the CO2 and changes it and then regenerates it it would be more efficient for electrochemistry. But that's an open question.",

I quickly wanted to add that there's been a lot of very exciting developments happening in the space of direct air capture but perhaps in terms of thinking about future advancements maybe we think about DAC to X that can be a material of choice that can be a suite of products of choice what have you and in getting from DAC to X there could be pathways that don't necessarily involve the use of one optimal magic technology. There could be a set of hybrid technologies that can get us from DAC to X. Some of them could be electrochemical some of them could be hybrid absorption crystallization adsorption crystallization membrane coupled with crystallization depends on what that X is and maybe this is a good opportunity for us to think about the translation of DAC to X and then thinking about the concentrations that we need in order to make X and the pathway to get to that which may not necessarily just be one technology but could be one optimal technology to get there.",

            "transcript": "Yeah I'm just going to mention something and unfortunately I only have 10 minutes and Chris is going to take over but I want to also echo what Greeshma just said and I also want to mention too don't forget that we can calculate the minimum work for any separation process which is the thermodynamic minimum and so one way to think about that is that final concentration of CO2. If you're starting off at the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere and you're getting it to say 99% purity because you want to transport the CO2 in a liquid phase but suppose that instead of transporting it in liquid phase you want to use it and convert it as a feedstock to something else. So I would ask the question what is the lowest purity that you actually need to get the CO2 to as the feedstock? Are you crystallizing it you know mineralizing it like Greeshma just mentioned are you turning it into a fuel? How low could you actually go to get the conversions you need to that to that X? And I think that that is an interesting parameter that's not often exploited because so many of us just look at thinking about transporting the CO2 but you might not have to and that's something to I think think about.",

            "transcript": "Yeah that's a point I wanted to piggyback off of because we've had a related discussion in a different breakout room. I'm David Kwabi from University of Michigan Mechanical Engineering. So if you do the minimum work calculation for capturing CO2 from air to one bar it looks pretty promising it's like 20 kilojoules per mole or something like that. But in reality it's going to be you're going to have to spend a lot more energy because you have a massive concentration factor to deal with. But if you want it for example to do jet fuel instead and we're not going to get electric planes anytime soon so let's say your target was jet fuel and you wanted to use microbes or like algae to do it you actually don't need to go all the way to 100% they can be pretty effective at like a couple percent like 2% 5%. So you can envision a situation where you're taking CO2 from air but you're feeding it to algae which are you know maybe not as effective at 400 ppm but super effective at 2-5% and then you have a useful end product as a result. So it kind of lets you know you're a little less constrained in terms of how high you need to go in concentration factor but you're still effective at doing something useful. So that's a sort of an end application driven design of your DAC system.",

So you save a lot of energy and the energy directly translates to the operating costs. So it's an interesting tunable parameter.",

I really liked the concept that Burcu that you had mentioned about when we think about membranes we often think well that doesn't work for direct air capture because you don't have a driving force but when you think about a contained liquid membrane you're combining approaches it's you're combining something like absorption with a membrane separation process and maybe there's benefits of thinking about the heat transfer across different systems whether it's a packed bed or a membrane or a fluid in a packed bed. So maybe you know any any thoughts on some of these kind of hybrid approaches?",

            "transcript": "I'll chime in. One of the ideas that I had been thinking about and I know Jen and I had talked about this previously was using metal nanoparticles deposited on membranes as a way of concentrating onto the CO2 side. So the concept being you have something that has a high affinity to absorb onto a metallic surface and then you might be able to use what's used in the catalytic world as the spillover effect where essentially as a sink that you absorb onto the nanoparticle then spill over onto the membrane or you're locally concentrated at that interface so then there's your concentration gradient across the membrane. So similar to what Burcu was talking about using the captured liquid but nanoparticles.",
