And there was also some discussion about I don't know if it was directly termed you know thinking about using basically AC frequency but some kind of alternating process and you can maybe we could list out what some of these creative alternative stimuli could be that we we think are not explored. You know I was just thinking from an electrochemistry point of view we typically think about you know DC applying potential or constant current or whatever to drive a process but there's there could be some potentially interesting states one could think about in the frequency space you know separating particularly if you have competitive reaction pathways can you separate things in the in the frequency domain could be an interesting way to perturb and control reactions. And I think there was some mention about plasma too which sounds interesting but I don't know much about that so I don't know what's going on in that space but it's an interesting point to look at you know what what is what is overlooked so far.",

So I mean this is like I don't know I don't know exactly how it's going to work if you want to do I don't know like you stick a magnet on the wind I don't know how that's going to actually catch out but you know that's a that's a potential.",

That's something I've thought a lot about not for this application but for other thermal applications but it's something that I think is interesting for this conversation.",

Are there opportunities to think about controlling microenvironments even within we think about one membrane one electrode as having a sort of consistent energetic landscape but we know that that's not true and is that something that can be exploited further to have you know one process we need in one localized domain nearby another one that somehow work concertedly together to get around all the we need a lot of complex things to happen right to get these transformations to go the way we want to. So I don't know if there's anything there but I was just thinking about corrosion currents and how you you can actually have distinct processes even on a on one material right.",

      "transcript": "And to add to that point I think there's been a lot of interest in using nuclear energy not just from an energy producing point of view but also using nuclear energy for producing materials. So I was working with a couple of folks at Idaho National Lab and we wrote a review paper I think earlier this year and what is interesting about nuclear energy is that you can have gamma alpha beta radiation you also get heat. So you can you can have many diverse sources to actually split your CO2 molecule. So it becomes like a double carbon negative pathway right. So you can use your nuclear reactor to produce the energy but then you can also siphon off a particular alpha radiation gamma beta whatever what have you to activate your CO2 molecule because CO2 has such low activation and it's so inert. So if you can do that then you can actually radicalize your CO2 and if you can then come up with recombination pathways that becomes a very unexplored way of actually trying to make the next generation of amino acids or material X if you like. So I think that goes back to the point of wind energy right trying to couple direct air capture with wind. Coupling nuclear with direct air capture I think that's an idea that's a little far out but worth exploring simply for the science of it.",
