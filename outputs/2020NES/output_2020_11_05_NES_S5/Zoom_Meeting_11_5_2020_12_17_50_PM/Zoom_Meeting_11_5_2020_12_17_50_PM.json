And so beyond economic incentives and making space for these people who are losing their positions, how do we even get communities to talk about the problem in the same way or to put value in science, period. This might be a bigger question that goes beyond decarbonizing the economy, but I do think it's a really important component.",

I was actually gonna, that was exactly what I was going to say because the specific issues of decarbonizing the economy are certainly not in my wheelhouse. And if you think about even scientists who are working on CO2 on a fundamental level don't know all of the specific details of what is necessary to push this forward.
