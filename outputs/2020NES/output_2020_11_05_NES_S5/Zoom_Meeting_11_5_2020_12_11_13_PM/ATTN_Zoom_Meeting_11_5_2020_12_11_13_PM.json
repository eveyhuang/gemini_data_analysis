As as I understand it, decarbonizing the economy, the the question is what role do negative emissions technologies have in this period before we've really decarbonized the main economy. Is that do others agree is that what we want to talk about?",

      "timestamp": "01:59-02:51",
      "transcript": "The main thing I'm thinking is that there's industry like steel making that have huge CO2 emissions and some of those emissions are just inherently locked in because they need to use coal and coke and limestone and they can't really replace it with anything else. So those CO2 emissions are are locked in. So those are the type of industries that would be especially interested in partnering with negative emissions technologies because that's how they can offset their their carbon emissions. And actually a big partner in that in that partnership would be carbon markets. So nowadays we have private carbon markets which are playing the the middle role. They see industry trying to buy carbon credits, they see the negative emissions sequestering the carbon and then they they match it through the carbon market. So that's sort of what what I see when I think about this decarbonizing economy topic.",

      "transcript": "And just to build off what Rafael said, you know our ability to decarbonize the economy is going to be totally dependent on strong carbon markets, a high price on carbon, like a series of high value products that we can produce from the carbon, all of which need to be stood up to be able to generate demand for these products and and sort of, you know, fuel the demand for negative emissions.",

      "transcript": "I I would like to add to what Rafael said too. I think it's very interesting. I think Rafael is pointing to to a very important element here, right? There are some parts of the economy that generate a lot of carbon emissions. So I think the first step in this whole discussion is we actually would need to kind of identify which are the parts that produce like a substantial amount of carbon emissions. Then in the next step, there are different ways to approach this problem to decarbonize the economy. One approach is what Rafael mentioned, to essentially capture the carbon emissions, right? So that's kind of like within the whole capture story. The other approach though, which is kind of where more my wheelhouse is, we can try to see can we actually make the same products without generating carbon emissions. Great point.",
