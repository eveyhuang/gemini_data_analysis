I'm interested in subsurface fluid rock systems and sort of the geological record and natural analogs of subsurface systems and to some degree, events in the past that are related to ocean fertilization that may have naturally occurred. So, I'm also associate dean for research in the College of Science at the U of A and I'm also interested in learning from you all about directions that we should be thinking about heading with these exciting technologies and science. Oh, and I'm an observer, so I'm probably going to lay back and not contribute too much. I'm try to hold back.",
