Um, I'm Simona Liguori, assistant professor at Clarkson University in the chemical and biomolecular engineering department and a chemical engineer as a background. I mean, in the last 10, 12 years, I work in the energy environmental science and space and above all in thermochemical process and thermochemical transformation. I mean, my work is not directly related to carbon reduction from the atmosphere, so on negative emission technology, but my work is more related to make carbon neutral energy to see and to supply energy to this, you know, negative emission technology because as Dr. Brown showed us, you know, we can have life cycle assessment that we can remove from air two gigatons, you know, of CO2. But at the end, you know, maybe we are going considering the net CO2, we are going just remove 200 megatons, right? So my aim is just to give the energy because if we can think about negative emission from cradle to gate, all that technology needs energy. And I'm here to say, hey, I can make carbon neutral energy in order to, you know, to supply this technology and in order to get the 4% right there. Nice to meet you all.",
