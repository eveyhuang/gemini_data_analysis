I think one, one question that could be asked is when we look at the life cycle, I mean, there are so many people with all kinds of different angles to this problem. And I think that's the strength here, that's what makes this group interesting. And I think one possible question that we could try to elucidate is what is actually the better way, mitigate or capture? That's, that is one possibility that I see that, that we could, that we could look at. Um, but we could also look at that, that's based on what Rafael said is we, we could look at how does, when we, when we use our technologies that the people are developing in this group. I think a lot of what we are doing, at least on my side, is technology readiness zero. So, um, what we could look at is like if we go for a really ambitious goal, how would the world look like? We could actually use life cycle techniques and integrate kind of the technologies, the really advanced technologies that we are working on that are probably 50 years out. How would the world look like?",

And you know, a lot of people talk about permanence and additionality and leakage, and this is a really important aspect of leakage. So if we take, uh, land out of grazing production in the US, but there's a lot of deforestation and grazing that happens in the Amazon, like the carbon outcomes of that are much worse than keeping land in, under grazing, um, in the US. So just considering leakage is a really important piece of how we have this conversation.",

            "transcript": "This was on the cows and poultry. So Roger and Simona, and I think going back to some of the things that Rafael talked about, I think this is a space which is ripe for hybrid technologies. I mean, oftentimes when we talk about negative emission technologies, we have those six or seven technologies in mind, which are, you know, backs or direct air capture or just enhanced weathering. And they're very discreet. And they're very discreet groups of people who actually work on these very discreet set of technologies. But the fact of the matter is that there are a lot of co-benefits and co-gen and, um, I would say synergies that can be obtained by coupling some of these. So for example, if we can come up with pathways for direct air capture and soils. There's a lot that we can learn from the fluid particle interactions, from the mineral and the fluid interactions by just studying, uh, engineered weathering and applying some of those concepts, uh, for direct air capture and soils through weathering, for example. Uh, there could be synergies in the way we use biochar, right? I mean, biochar, I guess the controversy there with biochar is that, you know, you take biomass from location A and put it in location B doesn't necessarily mean that there's been a significant carbon offset, but there could be more creative ways of using biochar so it can be used to maybe capture CO2. I don't know. So I, one way to think about this is to hybridize some of these technologies, hybridize some of these pathways to maybe get them, get us to start thinking about co-benefits. That could be one way. Uh, and again, uh, in the context of biogas, if there, if there are ways, and again, not a plug for what we're doing, but if there is a way for us to remove the CO2 that is co-produced with say the methane and biogas, mineralize that and produce a carbonate at the same time, that is an unconventional way of looking at bioenergy with carbon capture and removal. So there could be pathways in which we could combine weathering with some of these more engineered pathways and vice versa. I think that if there is going to be potential investment, I would encourage, uh, perhaps some of it to go towards some of these hybrid pathways and uncovering the underlying science so that way there is a thermodynamic basis and there is a kinetic basis for these pathways going forward.",

So a lot of them will anaerobically digest their manure and then they're trying to come up with co-products that they can sell that it's great if they're environmentally beneficial. But I mean, they're focused on the economics. Really, if we, going back to Greeshma's point, you know, if we start thinking about adding some of these technologies together, I think that's where you'll see the synergistic benefits. We just have to be careful with how much energy we're consuming and where it comes from.",
