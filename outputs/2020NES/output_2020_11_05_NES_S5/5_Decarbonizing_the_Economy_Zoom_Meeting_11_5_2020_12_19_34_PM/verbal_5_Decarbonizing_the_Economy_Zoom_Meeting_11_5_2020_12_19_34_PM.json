        "utterance": "GG: This was on the cows and poultry. So Roger and Simona, and I think going back to some of the things that Rafael talked about, I think this is a space which is ripe for hybrid technologies. I mean, oftentimes when we talk about negative emission technologies, we have those six or seven technologies in mind, which are, you know, backs or direct air capture or just enhanced weathering. And they're very discreet. And they're very discreet groups of people who actually work on these very discreet set of technologies. But the fact of the matter is that there are a lot of co-benefits and co-gen and, um, I would say synergies that can be obtained by coupling some of these. So for example, if we can come up with pathways for direct air capture and soils. There's a lot that we can learn from the fluid particle interactions, from the mineral and the fluid interactions by just studying, uh, engineered weathering and applying some of those concepts, uh, for direct air capture and soils through weathering, for example. Uh, there could be synergies in the way we use biochar, right? I mean, biochar, I guess the controversy there with biochar is that, you know, you take biomass from location A and put it in location B doesn't necessarily mean that there's been a significant carbon offset, but there could be more creative ways of using biochar so it can be used to maybe capture CO2. I don't know. So I, one way to think about this is to hybridize some of these technologies, hybridize some of these pathways to maybe get them, get us to start thinking about co-benefits. That could be one way. Uh, and again, uh, in the context of biogas, if there, if there are ways, and again, not a plug for what we're doing, but if there is a way for us to remove the CO2 that is co-produced with say the methane and biogas, mineralize that and produce a carbonate at the same time, that is an unconventional way of looking at bioenergy with carbon capture and removal. So there could be pathways in which we could combine weathering with some of these more engineered pathways and vice versa. I think that if there is going to be potential investment, I would encourage, uh, perhaps some of it to go towards some of these hybrid pathways and uncovering the underlying science so that way there is a thermodynamic basis and there is a kinetic basis for these pathways going forward.
