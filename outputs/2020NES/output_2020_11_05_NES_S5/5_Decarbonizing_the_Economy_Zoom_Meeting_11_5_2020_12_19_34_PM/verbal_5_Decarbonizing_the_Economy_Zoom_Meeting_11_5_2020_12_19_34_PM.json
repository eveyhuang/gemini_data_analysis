        "utterance": "GG: This was on the cows and poultry. So Roger and Simona, and I think going back to some of the things that Rafael talked about, I think this is a space which is ripe for hybrid technologies. I mean, oftentimes when we talk about negative emission technologies, we have those six or seven technologies in mind, which are, you know, backs or direct air capture or just enhanced weathering. And they're very discreet. And they're very discreet groups of people who actually work on these very discreet set of technologies. But the fact of the matter is that there are a lot of co-benefits and co-gen and, um, I would say synergies that can be obtained by coupling some of these. So for example, if we can come up with pathways for direct air capture and soils. There's a lot that we can learn from the fluid particle interactions, from the mineral and the fluid interactions by just studying, uh, engineered weathering and applying some of those concepts, uh, for direct air capture and soils through weathering, for example. Uh, there could be synergies in the way we use biochar, right? I mean, biochar, I guess the controversy there with biochar is that, you know, you take biomass from location A and put it in location B doesn't necessarily mean that there's been a significant carbon offset, but there could be more creative ways of using biochar so it can be used to maybe capture CO2. I don't know. So I, one way to think about this is to hybridize some of these technologies, hybridize some of these pathways to maybe get them, get us to start thinking about co-benefits. That could be one way. Uh, and again, uh, in the context of biogas, if there, if there are ways, and again, not a plug for what we're doing, but if there is a way for us to remove the CO2 that is co-produced with say the methane and biogas, mineralize that and produce a carbonate at the same time, that is an unconventional way of looking at bioenergy with carbon capture and removal. So there could be pathways in which we could combine weathering with some of these more engineered pathways and vice versa. I think that if there is going to be potential investment, I would encourage, uh, perhaps some of it to go towards some of these hybrid pathways and uncovering the underlying science so that way there is a thermodynamic basis and there is a kinetic basis for these pathways going forward.

Um and then uh we started out by wanting to identify whether there are sectors that we can use the same process captures you are doing fair uh or you can invent new processes without emissions. So identifying that boundary which may go to the next slide and then uh we all talked about ways to accelerate the timeline uh for progress for these these ideas. Media engagement, lots of discussion there. Um and then natural solutions tend to have uh a data preference for adoption versus technological solutions. And then um there were points that on uh so I was thinking about it from an investment business perspective, quantifying strengths um and quantifying these metrics are are crucial. And then second here we discussed about um sectors that are easier, quote unquote easy uh to to decarbonize versus not. So here we put electricity production. I guess I I added transportation as my own opinion, maybe maybe people currently. Um and then some that I guess many agreed as hard is steel cement um large vehicles and and food. Um and so should it should who uses negative emissions depends on which of these two categories you fall in. Uh and then uh and sort of, you know, this term decarbonization uh there's sort of two I guess enabling platforms, solar and wind uh based electricity which can be then combined to do X where X is whatever. Um transportation, other things and then other angle is producing carbon neutral uh fuels. Uh and then uh there's sort of, you know, other I guess some of the other discussions around uh using other forms of energy. Wait. There's too much for me. Oh my god. decarbonizing themselves and then co-benefits of hybridization uh and then we talked about this sort of integrated system view which led us into this tools category which I think was a neat output where, you know, if you had these tools, you can analyze these problems much faster.

And and I think there are some interesting opportunities as well because you get these silicate slags which you which you can then turn into carbonates and essentially use as a you know, as a a negative emission element to the process. So I think there are some interesting studies to be done in some of these hard to decarbonize industries, actually looking at all the steps of their processes and seeing what you could take out or what you could you can turn into a a zero emissions or where there might be a negative emission opportunity. Um it requires quite a lot of detailed understanding of the individual chemical processes or manufacturing processes themselves. But I liked your point about I liked your point about the the small scale emissions because in general, where we get emissions on a large scale, we have some chance of capturing them or you know, it may be it may be that the investment in finding a completely of doing it is is very worthwhile. Where you get lots of very small emitters, that can be that can be very much much harder to do with. I mean, it's much harder to do with emissions from the tailpipe of a of a car than it is from a from a power station. Of course. Actually, of course, there'll be there'll be small scale emissions from the different parts of natural environment that we aren't really able to deal with. But I certainly like the the the techno you know, the tools for techno economic. Because it's small emissions that we aren't really able to deal with. ",
