How you use biomass, how you transport things, what the limits are on some of these options and often times you find the limit is land use. And yet most of our energy discussion has the carbon discussion has focused on energy, and yet I think it's now going to rotate more toward land use and things like that are critical to scientists like you who are going to be doing research for the rest of your career on these things. It's an important topic. We're getting our 15-minute warning now, so I'm not sure what Venkat, can you tell us what would be a good outcome in terms of your ability to report?",

I think just telling any coherent set of maybe three or four coherent sets of message would be would be great. What is the problem we we tried to address? What are the gaps what are the gaps in I guess tooling or what are the gaps in understanding and then what are some ways in which this could be fixed. I think one of the ways in which these breakouts typically tend to move is they seed potential proposals we would write among ourselves in clusters of you know three or whatever. So the breakout sessions are usually intended to seed those kinds of ideas. So hopefully that sort of we know we identify some set of questions that maybe some teams will will pursue in the as a proposal for the for this meeting and future.",

            "transcript": "Okay maybe I'll just walk through what what all I I digested and and maybe you can also capture what I didn't digest. So so I think the initial discussions we discussed a few of the industries where there are locked in CO2 emissions so they may need to be paired with negative emission. And then we started out by wanting to identify whether there are sectors that would use the same process capture CO2 and pair or invent new processes without emissions. So identifying that boundary which may go to the next slide and then we all talked about ways to accelerate the timeline for progress for these areas. Community engagement, lots of discussion there. And then natural solutions tend to have a greater preference for adoption versus technological solutions. And then there were points around I was thinking about it from an investment thesis perspective, quantifying strengths and quantifying these metrics are crucial. Then second here we discussed about sectors that are easier quote unquote easy to decarbonize versus not. So here we put electricity production. I guess I added transportation as my own opinion maybe maybe people don't agree. And then some that I guess many agreed as hard is steel, cement, large vehicles and food. And so should should who uses negative emission depend on which of these two categories you fall in. And then and sort of you know this current decarbonization there's sort of two I guess enabling platforms. Solar and wind based electricity which can be then combined to do X where X is whatever transportation or other things. And then other angle is producing carbon neutral fuels. And then the sort of you know some of the other discussion around using other forms of existing infrastructure to be decarbonized. Co-benefits implementation and then we talked about the sort of integrated system view which led us into this tools category which I think was in my neat outline but you know if you had these tools you could analyze these problems much faster. There's a there's basically some consensus that this lack of good open source tools, there are some databases could be improved and verification is a challenge.",

And maybe a question we should think about is which of these technologies is best poised to most immediately engage and then what are the barriers to those to that engagement? How do we how do we move them from in the benchtop to to the economy?",

What are the things that keep us from getting to a billion tons of negative emissions and it's a it's a real challenge. A lot of things on that list. Other thoughts? One of the things that that struck me in the Venkat's assessment was this issue of identifying what the emissions that are most appropriately dealt with by negative emissions might be and that many of those are going to be in the in the small categories and the things that aren't normally thought of and that that's certainly an important research topic of establishing the criteria for why you would call things appropriate for negative emissions and then what are those things? We're all so used to thinking about electric power and I kind of agree that electric power looks like it's handled or at least the technology is there.",

            "transcript": "I mean I think there is I think there is a lot of work to to do with with our you know with industries like steel making. I mean we are I know we we have a number of programs in the UK looking at zero carbon steel making, looking at hydrogen reduction of steel and I know Tata Steel are actually supporting quite a lot of that thinking about what they might do. And I and I think there are some interesting opportunities as well because you get these silicate slags which you can which you can turn into carbonates and essentially use as a you know as a a negative you know as a negative emission element to the process. So I think there are some interesting studies to be done in some of these hard to decarbonize industries actually looking at all the steps of their processes and seeing what you could take out or what you could you could turn into a zero emissions or whether there might be a negative emission opportunity. But that requires quite a lot of detailed understanding of the individual chemical processes or manufacturing processes themselves. But I like your point about I like your point about the the small scale emissions because in general where we get emissions on a large scale we have some chance of capturing them or you know maybe it may be that the investment in finding a complete way of doing it is is very worthwhile. Where you get lots of very small emitters it can be that that can be very much much harder to do. I mean it's much harder to do with emissions from the tailpipe of a of a car than it is from a from a power station of course.",
