      "transcript": "Yeah on this hybrid approaches another example I can give is that we do here in Guelph quite a bit is the production of biochar and then trying to use the biochar to replace coke in steel making. Of course the big challenge is that the coke in steel making has a very particular morphology chemical properties and so on and it's difficult to make a biochar that can directly replace it but that's one big opportunity to decarbonize steel making is take biochar and replace coke.",

So like long ago I spent a summer at a cement plant working and they were replacing their pet coke with actually like hazardous waste. So like slightly spent toluene. And so instead of getting rid of the toluene as just a waste product they're using it as a fuel product and that's where you start to see some of those benefits too and you're substituting for the pet coke or whatever.",

So the question is would there be value actually within the United States or within a more global context to to essentially come up with a with an Ecoinvent type system or or or improve upon Ecoinvent. So just for context maybe maybe you can because you're the specialist you may want to share with with the group members like what what this is.",

      "transcript": "Right so life cycle assessment typically relies on generalized inventories if you don't have particular inventories. So you can think about like anthracite mining right so it's a type of coal in the US. Europe's been a bit ahead of us on all of this in terms of developing the types of databases you use and Ecoinvent is one of the big ones. The US has the US life cycle inventory from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory which has some of the processes but it's missing so you usually need to fill in. And the USDA E-PACT actually has been putting together a lot of the agricultural databases. I mean agriculture is a little bit interesting right because like depending how you produce a kilogram of corn it could be vastly different in terms of things like added amendments water energy. So I mean I think the US is lagging a little bit behind on the actual inventory data to characterize our systems whereas Europe's been doing it for a while.",
