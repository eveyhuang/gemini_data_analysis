Um and there must be a number of other industries that that fall into that category. We probably just don't have very many of them in the UK so they don't feature very much in our analysis, but you may have them in the US. And somehow they need preferential I think they need some kind of preferential access to the benefits of of you know, to be able to claim the negative emissions.",

So so and they have an easy solution. So for example, uh just plant more trees. So so I've heard that oil industries are buying a lot of land because they want to plant trees because they they find that a pretty easy thing to to do. So that's where then restricting them to be able to claim carbon credits would encourage them to go more towards a technology solution rather than easy solution.",

Maybe there would be portfolio of solution, right? Hard, everything is hard because I think steel, cement, yes, aircraft, most of the time we refer to heavy transportation, also you know, heavy trucks or ship. You know, it's not just aviation. It's everything and they are working with jet fuel. Yeah, but it's always you know, jet fuel contain always fossil fuel and they are going to as they are going to pledge, you know, to be like carbon neutral by 2020 because they are going to offset their carbon planting more tree, you know, doing giving some money also, you know, to removing carbon, but this is not I think this is to be a way, but another way is that yes, carbon tax giving them some restriction and say, okay, you you don't want carbon tax? Okay, start to improve the efficiency of your equipment, okay? Because steel and cement are really old, above all in the USA are really old as um as industry and they are going to meet a lot in in particular there is one device that is called the boiler and this one is going to meet the 55% of CO2 from cement and steel. So just try to think out of the box. We need a boiler. Boiler means just firm. You need energy to make steam. Make energy. Okay, I don't want to you know, sell my you know, sell my uh research on expertise, but think out the box and say, okay, invite them to use a different source of um fuel instead of fossil fuel. What about hydrogen? What about ammonia? What about all these other particular or what about solar wind? Yes, if there is the possibility, okay, we we are going to do plan, I mean, I don't want to say a field of solar plant, but we can make energy in a different way. You know, push them. I know, it will be just a little bit down in the first year, but doing them also a projection where they can be after five years and maybe they can pledge, yes, we will be carbon neutral. And then we can be upset, we are going to upset our carbon, so we can be also negative as industry. I mean, these are just you know, my two cents about that we need energy somehow and we have also to think about that energy is coming from carbon, you know, is always coming from somewhere that requires also CO2 emissions. A negative emission is part of the game. It's not the main could be the main role, but it's just the part of the game. Yes, social politics, everything, uh they have to play all the part and we are there just to say, hey, why you do this one? Why you do this one? And for the long project, so you can gain, you are not losing money. You know, because you know, I mean, all the companies think just to gain money.",
