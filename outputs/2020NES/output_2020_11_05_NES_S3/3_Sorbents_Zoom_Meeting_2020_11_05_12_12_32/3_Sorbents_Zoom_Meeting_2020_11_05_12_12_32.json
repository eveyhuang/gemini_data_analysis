            "transcript": "metal cations, things like that. And that leads to a lot of different problems regarding kind of how do you actually keep them stable when you get a CO2 molecule on there and off there? How many cycles do you want these things to operate as a sorbent? How do you replace stuff that's partially degraded, right? As well as sort of what is the format of the reactor that you want to use. I think David's paper showed a reactor that looks a lot like a redox flow battery. You might want something like that. You might want something like I think Xiao's done some work looking at materials that look a little bit more like a batch reactor. That has some benefits as well, especially if the molecules are tethered to a surface rather than freely solubilized. And so I think a lot of sort of the degradation pathways and the challenges sort of couple with can you find the right sorbent and then what is the best mode of sort of delivering the capabilities. I would posit just if you'll indulge me just for a second. It's also another question as to whether electrochemical sorbents are the best way to go here. Maybe that'll pop up in a different question here, but maybe there are other methods, you know, could be photochemical, could be thermochemical, where there might be reason to look at sorbents in that space as well. I just wanted to throw that out there.",

            "transcript": "Yeah. Yes, thanks Fik. So to follow up on this, you know, there there's a there are a number of approaches here, I think. One would involve having an electrolyte in solution and and the other would not. And so you can imagine gas, you know, electrically switching a sorbent that's pulling CO2 from the gas mixture onto the surface and using a electrochemical switching to release CO2. And so I think there are a number of possible approaches that go beyond sort of solution electrochemistry. So all right, I think maybe that helps define this sort of area a bit. What I'd like to do is ask everybody to spend a minute or two and just write down one idea or or thought that you have that you think is an important question or topic to discuss in this area. And so, we're going to let's be quiet for one or two minutes and just write down a brief thought that you have with regard to this topic that you'd like to discuss.",

That that initial question is pretty specific about regeneration. I think we want to be much broader and just think about electrochemical possibilities for CO2 capture and separations. If you want, we can even broaden it further on sorbent design. But yeah, let's not focus too narrowly. So keep an open mind and go big. Okay.

So I'm somewhat familiar with this area and the question that jumps out to me is thinking about the range of nucleophiles that, the versions I'm familiar with is you take like a quinone and you reduce it and it forms the O minus which can attack CO2 and you can swing it back. Or doing this with sulfur nucleophiles. I'm just curious about folks who may know this area better, the range of nucleophiles, thinking about how can we generate for example nitrogen-based nucleophiles electrochemically, which you could swing back and forth since we know amines are capable of pulling CO2 out of air. So maybe that's something that folks is kind of already been done, but I'm just curious.",

I think people have looked at thermal nucleophiles for thermal capture but not very many that are redox switchable. So part of it is is trying to attach something that's has a reversible redox couple near your nucleophile to see whether you can impact those properties. And to some extent, we've had sort of mixed results, but they do have to be close. They have to be closely coupled basically. You know, changing the redox potential one or two more bonds away is not going to give you the the changes in properties that you need to switch. So...",
