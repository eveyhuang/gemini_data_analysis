            "transcript": "a lot of times when you think about technology advancement, while direct air capture might be the ultimate goal, it's unlikely that the first technology is going to be able to go after that. And a nice thing about electrochemical technologies as compared to say thermochemical technologies is that you could be more effective when you're smaller, right? Thermochemical technologies usually you make a lot of hay when you're really large and can take advantage of sort of heat integration and infrastructure, right? And so, one of the things is are there applications that you could think about where electrochemical technologies or some of the things we're talking about here are uniquely positioned? Because I assume that in cabin capture it's really just like alkaline pellets, right? You know, ala Apollo 13 or something like that, right? And, you know, if that's true, then the question would be are there opportunities to kind of say, are there can we sort of walk down the technology curve from like say carbon capture to maybe in in, you know, cabins to maybe buildings to eventually direct air capture?",

            "transcript": "Yeah, so actually it's it's a very interesting project. It's not as challenging as direct air capture, but nonetheless it has other challenges. So right now, they use zeolites. So it's essentially a thermal regeneration. So there are problems with zeolites though that I don't have to get into. But they are interested in sorbents as opposed to zeolites. And in cabin you want something non-volatile, kind of benign solvent. And the good thing about we can think about also like pressure swing and in space vacuum is kind of free. So there are some advantages on that front. But I think they are also interested ultimately, you know, maybe like scavenging oxygen out of CO2 like through a Bosch type of reaction. But yeah, right now they are thermally regenerating at a much higher cost actually for zeolites and they also have to scrub, they they have to dry the air first because zeolites are not really stable with moisture. I don't know, I think I've missed your question.",

            "transcript": "No, I guess it was kind of around and it was it was keying off of what you said, but it was for everybody, which is, are we jumping the gun going directly to direct air capture? Are there other opportunities along the way down the CO2 concentration curve for lack of a better word where we could add a tremendous amount of value in terms of negative carbon emissions, and what might those be?",

            "transcript": "So so one thing that came to mind comes to mind for me is well, yeah, so direct air capture is hard. You see you're taking, you know, you're capturing from 400 ppm and you want to go to one bar because you want to sequester or convert. If instead you still capture from air but your your requirement was only to go to like two or 3% let's say, that concentration of CO2 would be useful if you were doing something like algae. So like algae actually don't need to go all the way to 100%. If you if you get up to a couple percent, even 5%, they they can be pretty effective. So you can use it to do things like algae, like fuels for like aviation fuel or whatever. You can, you know, there's a whole bunch of other work engineering algae to make particular products, but but that could be sort of another like a sort of a step down the curve where you are doing CO2 capture and it is useful because you know, we're not going to get electric planes anytime soon. But you're not, you know, you don't have this massive concentration factor like 2500 or whatever it is. So that might be another way.",

Is there an optimal scale at which to run these electrochemical processes and is it can you can you scale it down without any loss indefinitely? Like what's what's what what sizes matter?",

            "timestamp": "04:26-06:26",
            "transcript": "It depends on the process a little bit and it depends upon where your cost is in the process. So for example, you could sort of think of it as flow batteries are an easy example because you can separate power and energy and so if you want an energy intensive application, the cost is dominated by what's in your tank. If you have a power dominant application it's dominated by what it costs you to make the reactor. In these kind of systems it's a bit different, right? And it would probably the way you'd want to think about it is throughput, right? So it's kind of what is the capital cost of your reactor and then how much CO2 can you put through it because that's how you're going to make money, right? And so that's how you should think about it. I mean capital cost is important because, you know, bankability, like someone's got to pay for the thing, right? And so if you think about like the first solar cells, they they kind of stunk, right? But they're still working and they're small and you can put them on your roof, right? And so, if for electrochemical systems you could build at that sort of scale, local residential scale, and that allows you to do a lot more learning as you go and it allows you also to make smaller products which means that there's less opportunities for for screw ups and a lot less money involved. For a lot of sort of, you know, the larger scale systems like I guess carbon engineering, I mean I think that system is is is pretty big in the base case and I don't know how many of them they've built. I'm not so I've seen a lot of pretty pictures but I don't know if I've actually seen a plant. And so there's some something about like well who's paying for this? How confident are you that this is going to work? Yada yada yada this kind of stuff, right? So I don't think electrochemical systems can be infinitely small for sure. But you could be a lot smaller than thermochemical systems and actually if you look at scaling analysis, thermochemical systems can beat out electrochemical systems at large enough scale, right? Just because of heat integration, we're really good at that. But at smaller scales the tables turn.",

It's not I know it's very hard work. Oh no no no not at all. I'd rather listen and write it down than Yeah. So I basically can you guys see the screen with the PowerPoint? Okay cool. So I just basically went by because there's a couple of repeat topics so I I sort of grouped them into major categories here. So first I think we started off with degradation pathways and there was a that's sort of what set off the discussion about and then so I just put down those points there. Reactor format. I think we discussed a lot about what sort of engineering systems we do that. I don't know if we we had like somebody made a good comment about oh electrochemical sorbents the best solution. I thought that was a cool sort of introverted like insightful question on our own platform but I don't know if you want to keep that. I think that somebody said it was a good opportunity to develop multifunctional materials, maybe use a backbone actually no it was an IL backbone with a redox active material.",
