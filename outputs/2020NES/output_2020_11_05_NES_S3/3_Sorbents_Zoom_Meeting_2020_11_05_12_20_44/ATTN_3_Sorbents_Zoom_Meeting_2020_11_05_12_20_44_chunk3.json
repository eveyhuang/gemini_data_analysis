Is this is this work? I mean I know you can do this for higher CO2 streams as a way to sort of just increase it passively on this side but is there anything that's good enough to do that for air or is this ridiculous?",

The first step is to let the air pass through the membrane and then after that just reduce the highly concentrated CO2. So I think it's not a ridiculous idea at all.",

      "transcript": "Jimmy I wanted to add something that was on my list of things that I was thinking about during our quiet time and that was do we have to release it in all cases right? So many of us in this room work on CO2 reduction. So one of the things that we've thought about is instead of reducing CO2 let's reduce the it would be an alkyl carbonate or carbamate right these are the products of CO2 capture with amines and hydroxides or alkoxides respectively. And if we could just directly reduce it from there that's a solution. And I would argue that some of the CO2 reduction alkaline cells basically do that right because you're probably not reducing directly CO2 but you're reducing bicarbonate or carbonate at those pHs. And so I think that is an interesting approach and so sort of just re-shifting our thinking about CO2 reduction to reducing bound CO2 to some of these capture agents directly.",

      "transcript": "But then you have a solid and then it depends on what you want to use it for so maybe some sort of building material perhaps then the application changes entirely. But for example carbon engineering was mentioned and they basically do this process where they have CO2 react with hydroxide and then they precipitate the they precipitate a solid with calcium carbonate or precipitate calcium carbonate and then heat up the calcium carbonate to release the CO2. But perhaps you could go to some other solid product you know not solid calcium carbonate but solid something else which is potentially more useful than calcium carbonate. But that's potentially an interesting direction. Because one of the things I always thought well with some of the mineralization stuff is that okay you take the CO2 out and now it's a solid that you can easily dispose of but can you make a solid that's as useful if not more than some of the traditional products of CO2 electro reduction. That's an open question.",

It's pretty easy to make cement other ways so there's some question as to sort of what kind of cost numbers you need to hit but that's a possibility right?",
