            "transcript": "That would be what I was thinking was just as I'm doodling over here some imines for example, which would be sort of the equivalent of a of a quinone where you could reduce the imine um and generate something that's like an N minus and it would grab CO2 very efficiently. And then if you swing it back, you oxidize it back to the immune form, it would release it. Um, but I don't, yeah. The oxygen sensitivity is a good question. I I mean, it could still be a problem and water could start to become a problem too for that, but if it's N minus, it should probably be basic enough to deprotonate water. That could be an issue, but um, yeah.",

Um, you you're thinking a lot about thermodynamics here, but if you're doing a negative emissions um science um proposal and suggesting capture from air, a lot of it's about kinetics. It's an extraction from an unbelievably dilute mixture and uh it's all about the kinetics and interface and liquids have a real problem there. Uh, you know, how do you interface the gas of the air uh with a liquid and get good uptake? Um, so be sure to I I would encourage you to think about that as well when you come up with um new new proposal ideas.",

So you're probably bubbling the CO2 in solution and that has a solubility. But uh it would be cool. I don't know if it's possible to have these in some sort of um absorbent matrix that is somehow ionically conductive, so it doesn't need a liquid and you could capture directly by passing the air stream through.",

Um, and then you have sort of imagine fingers of the polymer moving into this 2D site which allows ions to pass back and forth, right?",

What's what's the slow step in getting, you know, the CO2 to the actual catalyst surface or whatnot?",

I mean, if you have sort of pure CO2, you know, convectively transported over a porous layer, you know, then kinetics are probably going to be a problem will be your problem. If you're talking about 400 parts per million and maybe of a blower, but maybe it's just sort of natural diffusion, then I I tend to think that transport is going to be your problem. Um, almost immediately, right? Even if, you know, I think, you know, by the time you get your kinetic rate going, you're going to run out of material, right? So I do think that there is an interesting need for, can you make, and Andrew, this might be what you're getting at, active materials that have, you know, some sort of hierarchical structure that will preferentially drive CO2 or increase the CO2 flux to the surface. And can you do that through either hierarchical structure or maybe some CO2 polymers or something like that that can kind of continue to drive the thing in there. Um, as opposed to just relying on, you know, simple diffusive transport.",
