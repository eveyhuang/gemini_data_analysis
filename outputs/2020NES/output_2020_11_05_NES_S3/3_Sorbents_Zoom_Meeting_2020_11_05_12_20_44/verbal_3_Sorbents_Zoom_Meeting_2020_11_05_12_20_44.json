Um I'll say that the well, a couple things maybe, but in terms of the the one minute sort of idea or thing I'm thinking about, um you know, one thing I'll just throw out there is sort of thinking about ways of building sort of multifunctional uh either interfaces or materials that that sort of satisfy a number of the requirements that you need for CO2 separation, especially from air. So, um you know, so you you if you're doing say CO2 capture from air, you want something that's the oxygen that's not uh sort of sensitive to oxygen. Um you also want ideally something that's non-volatile. So if if you're doing this in an organic solvent, you're going to have issues with solvent loss. Um and then you want something that's uh redox active or that sort of responds to an electric field or potential. Um it will capture CO2 in one state and releases in another. And I'm curious as to whether it it makes any sense and you know, maybe in in typically what you would do is you pick the solvent and then you pick the active material and you sort of mix the two together, you know, you sort of build your system from there. Um I'm curious whether it makes sense to also think about trying to do or make sort of multifunctional sorbents that would fulfill a number of these requirements simultaneously. So for example, you start with uh like an ionic liquid, for example, which would not where you wouldn't have as much of an issue with uh volatility. And that is sort of your backbone and then you sort of build on top of that some sort of functionality or something either redox active or electric field responsive that does your that does sort of the switching uh sort of CO2 reversible CO2 binding release component. Um so I'm just sort of that's sort of what I'm I'm thinking about. Um is is whether you could build these sort of chemical uh these sort of new material systems and then you you you know, you put that in like a reactor um and one could then think about how effective it actually works in a in a real system, but yeah, that's that's one thought.

There's certain minerals that are, this is my limited knowledge, that are stable to bury underground.

And then another point, the solid state chemist and me immediately starts thinking about, well, if I wanted to give a surface to Phil or to Jenny so they could do their reactions, what would it be? And I'm guessing whether or not if there's an opportunity here for nitrite-based porous or nitrite-based moths or nitrite-based types of materials that can perhaps give us the opportunity to create that amine that we've been talking about. I mean, there's been some success. I'm not sure if we are all convinced of the success of doing nitrogen reduction using nitrite-based materials. And then that sort of leads me to perhaps a super off idea of how about if we could, we know that flue gas has a lot of nitrogen in there and very little CO2.

But I think within the within the thermodynamics we mostly focused on like enthalpic effects and not really like entropic effects. So the one thing that I have been fantasizing about is um since we're on the topic of electrochemical simulation. Um can we think about materials that would like have some induced entropic effects that would drive uh let's say the regeneration of CO2. I mean apart from enthalpic effects we can also have you know the entropic effects. Um and related to this, you know, we also discussed about these redux active CO2 carriers or redux active molecules, nucleophile. Um how about um designing the solvent around it. So you know this reduction potentials was too negative. I think um Jenny mentioned that. Well, I think we can design the interaction between these molecules with the environment to shift those potentials. So for example, I mean since I work with ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents, I'm thinking about like hydrogen bonded systems that can interact with these species and shift the redox potentials so that you are in a better place and not like driving some other unwanted side reactions. Um and that has some entropy theme underneath it. Um I think those are the things that I thought about. And another thing is um we have worked with like encapsulated ionic liquids. So these had um these had graphene oxide material in its shell. So we thought okay, we have a conductive uh you know shell material. And initially we thought that we can use it at like energy storage, but it was kind of a naive idea because these are um you know, um kind of encapsulated liquids and they don't feel any voltage uh distribution. But in the context of CO2 capture and conversion or regeneration, um they can actually work as electrode materials where the ionic liquid or the core material can serve as like CO2 reservoirs. So you don't have to worry about um you know, have to bring CO2 to uh to the electrode surface.

Um, if you have a power dominant application, it's dominated by what the what it cost you to make the reactor. Uh in these kind of systems, it's a bit different, right?

I mean, capital cost is important because, you know, bank ability, like someone's got to pay for the thing, right?

So, uh first I think we started off of degradation pathways and there was uh that's what sort of what set off the discussion. Um, about and then so I just put down those uh points there. Uh reactor format, I think we discussed a lot about uh what sort of uh electric engineering systems we do that. Uh I don't know if we we had like somebody made a good comment about, oh, electric chemical sorbents the best solution. Uh I thought that was a cool uh sort of insightful question on our own platform, but I don't know if you want to keep that. Uh I think that uh someone said it was a good uh opportunity to develop multifunctional materials. Uh maybe use a backbone. Uh actually no, it was an IL backbone of a redox active material. Um, then there were uh there was a lot of discussion from the chemistry side on uh can we increase nucleity? Uh but not increase over potential of uh quinones. Um, and then there was a good suggestion to maybe look at fenoxides or amines. Um, and then there was a whole discussion direct air capture, etc. and can we electrochemically generate an amine? Um, there was a good suggestion on oxide absorbents. Um, can we use it for um reactive separations, I guess? The thermo and then the encapsulation. And then there was a whole bunch of discussion everywhere on CO2 capture and conversion. So I put that down at the bottom. ",
