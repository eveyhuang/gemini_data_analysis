            "transcript": "Uh yeah, I am. So I mentioned uh this uh work on sort of electrochemical pH swing as a way of doing CO2 separation. Um I'd say that the well, a couple of things maybe, but in terms of the the one minute sort of idea or thing I'm thinking about, um you know one thing I'll just throw out there is sort of thinking about ways of building sort of multifunctional uh either interfaces or materials that that sort of satisfy a number of the requirements that you need for CO2 separation especially from air. So um you know so you you if you're doing CO2 capture from air you want something that's say oxygen that's not uh sort of sensitive to oxygen. Um you also want ideally something that's non-volatile so if you're doing this in an organic solvent you're going to have issues with solvent loss. Um and then you want something that's um redox active or that's sort of responds to an electric field or a potential and so captures CO2 in one state and then releases it in another. And I'm curious as to whether it it makes any sense and you know maybe in in typically what you would do is you pick the solvent and then you pick the active material and you sort of mix the two together you know you sort of build your system from there. Um I'm curious whether it makes sense to also think about trying to do or or make sort of multifunctional sorbents that would fulfill a number of these requirements simultaneously. So for example you start with uh like an ionic liquid for example which would not where you wouldn't have as much of an issue with uh volatility and that is sort of your backbone and then you sort of build on top of that some sort of functionality or something either redox active or electric field responsive that does your that does sort of the switching uh the sort of CO2 reversible CO2 binding and release component. So I'm just sort of that's sort of what I'm thinking about um is whether you could build these sort of chemical uh these these sort of new material systems. And then you you you know you put that in like a reactor um and one could then think about how effective it actually works in a in a real system but yeah that's that's one thought.",

Uh I mean exactly the same reasons you just mentioned they're non-volatile um and we can have appreciable amount of quinone solubility in in the right ionic liquid and we can also uh improve the selectivity for CO2 and suppress it for oxygen to improve the sensitivity but ultimately the redox active carrier is um you know can be sensitive to oxygen and not necessarily maybe the uh electrolyte itself. But the um I think the one of the main problems is uh the ionic liquids are viscous and no matter you know how you design them they are going to be end up you know more viscous than your aqueous systems and that's one challenge and that kind of uh I think leads us into what kind of reactor designs can we have. I I yeah I I think that's where I'll stop.",

I think that um you know I think Burcu and I have been in a group that was doing a lot of CO2 capture electrochemically when we were there. And the two questions that I've always had is uh one of them is more engineering is it more efficient to have a homogeneous redox cycling system or a heterogeneous mobilized one? And that one has always been like you know is one more stable than the other? And the other one that I never really understood and I think it's a question for the chemists is uh I think the reason why the chemical engineers or the chemists picked quinones is because it has a reaction and it binds by reaction. But uh I never could understand like how does the chemistry affect the separation factor? Like if it's a quinone does it absorb everything even from direct air capture or are there different chemistries that can be more efficient at different concentration ranges? Um and that I don't think it's something that has been systematically been explored but that's just my opinion.",

            "transcript": "Yeah that's what I was thinking was so the you know from what I've seen you know from my surveying the literature I don't know it that well but a lot of it is focused on that I've seen is quinones because when you reduce them they make uh you know we can think of the classic redox couple of quinone hydroquinone but it goes through the double O minus compound which is now nucleophilic which can attack CO2 to make a carbonate and if you then oxidize it back it will go back to the quinone which is not nucleophilic. So I would guess that the the selectivity factor must be huge for CO2 from a quinone to a reduced quinone. I would guess part of the problem is the reduced quinone is also probably oxygen you know sensitive that's one issue but um and the nucleophilicity is like you know modest it's a phenoxide essentially. So that's why I was kind of thinking about you know can we I was over here doodling random structures to try to find nitrogen-based um redox active things that you could reduce and make you know N minus or neutral amines which now we know have good CO2 capture.

So that's like staggering right it's easily enough to capture from air. Um but that one has a reduction potential of minus 1.7 or 0.8. And so if we plot the log of um the binding constant versus the redox potential we get a linear free energy relationship which basically just means that as we go more negative we bind better but obviously more negative means more oxygen sensitive. And so we're basically trying to find ways to get off that line uh so to speak right um so basically try to find ways to improve the nucleophilicity uh without um improving the potential. So the stability issue is partly the reduction potential and also in the um uh dianion form a lot of the CH bonds also tend to degrade for various reasons",
