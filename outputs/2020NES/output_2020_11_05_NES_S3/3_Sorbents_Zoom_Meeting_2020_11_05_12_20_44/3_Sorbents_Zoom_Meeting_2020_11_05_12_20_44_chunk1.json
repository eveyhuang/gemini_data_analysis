I mean, actually one one thing we could do is I think some of you are much more sort of coming from this research area. I know Jenny you and and Vic have have been working in this area. Um but and you explained a little bit about what you're doing. Um but David, uh are you also you're also working really in this area? Is that right?",

            "transcript": "Uh yeah, I am. So I mentioned uh this uh work on sort of electrochemical pH swing as a way of doing CO2 separation. Um I'll say that the well, a couple things maybe, but in terms of the the one minute sort of idea or thing I'm thinking about, um you know, one thing I'll just throw out there is sort of thinking about ways of building sort of multifunctional uh either interfaces or materials that that sort of satisfy a number of the requirements that you need for CO2 separation, especially from air. So, um you know, so you you if you're doing say CO2 capture from air, you want something that's the oxygen that's not uh sort of sensitive to oxygen. Um you also want ideally something that's non-volatile. So if if you're doing this in an organic solvent, you're going to have issues with solvent loss. Um and then you want something that's uh redox active or that sort of responds to an electric field or potential. Um it will capture CO2 in one state and releases in another. And I'm curious as to whether it it makes any sense and you know, maybe in in typically what you would do is you pick the solvent and then you pick the active material and you sort of mix the two together, you know, you sort of build your system from there. Um I'm curious whether it makes sense to also think about trying to do or make sort of multifunctional sorbents that would fulfill a number of these requirements simultaneously. So for example, you start with uh like an ionic liquid, for example, which would not where you wouldn't have as much of an issue with uh volatility. And that is sort of your backbone and then you sort of build on top of that some sort of functionality or something either redox active or electric field responsive that does your that does sort of the switching uh sort of CO2 reversible CO2 binding release component. Um so I'm just sort of that's sort of what I'm I'm thinking about. Um is is whether you could build these sort of chemical uh these sort of new material systems and then you you you know, you put that in like a reactor um and one could then think about how effective it actually works in a in a real system, but yeah, that's that's one thought.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I um and shall would know this. So I actually have a publication dated from like five years ago, I think, um on electrochemically mediated CO2 separations using ionic liquids and using quinones as redox active carriers. Uh I mean exactly the same reasons you just mentioned, they are non-volatile. um and we can have appreciable amount of quinone solubility and and the right ionic liquids. And we can also uh improve the selectivity for CO2 and suppress it for oxygen to improve the sensitivity. But ultimately the redox active carrier is um you know, can be sensitive to oxygen and not necessarily maybe the electrolyte itself. But the um I think the main one of the main problems is um the ionic liquids are viscous, no matter you know, how you design them, they are going to be end up, you know, more viscous than your aqueous systems. And that's one challenge. And that kind of uh I think leads us into what kind of reactor designs can we have? Um I I yeah, I I think that's where I'll stop.",
