            "transcript": "Um I have couple of things to throw. Um so we discussed about the thermodynamics and we touched upon kinetics. But I think within the within the thermodynamics we mostly focused on like enthalpic effects and not really like entropic effects. So the one thing that I have been fantasizing about is um since we're on the topic of electrochemical simulation. Um can we think about materials that would like have some induced entropic effects that would drive uh let's say the regeneration of CO2. I mean apart from enthalpic effects we can also have you know the entropic effects. Um and related to this, you know, we also discussed about these redux active CO2 carriers or redux active molecules, nucleophile. Um how about um designing the solvent around it. So you know this reduction potentials was too negative. I think um Jenny mentioned that. Well, I think we can design the interaction between these molecules with the environment to shift those potentials. So for example, I mean since I work with ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents, I'm thinking about like hydrogen bonded systems that can interact with these species and shift the redox potentials so that you are in a better place and not like driving some other unwanted side reactions. Um and that has some entropy theme underneath it. Um I think those are the things that I thought about. And another thing is um we have worked with like encapsulated ionic liquids. So these had um these had graphene oxide material in its shell. So we thought okay, we have a conductive uh you know shell material. And initially we thought that we can use it at like energy storage, but it was kind of a naive idea because these are um you know, um kind of encapsulated liquids and they don't feel any voltage uh distribution. But in the context of CO2 capture and conversion or regeneration, um they can actually work as electrode materials where the ionic liquid or the core material can serve as like CO2 reservoirs. So you don't have to worry about um you know, have to bring CO2 to uh to the electrode surface. Um I mean you can tell me if it's a crazy idea but um something that that I think is something that we thought about in the past and kind of um you know, fits into this discussion I think.",

So I've thought about it in in in from the from this uh CO2 uh CO2 electrochemical conversion uh standpoint of view, but I think it it might be analogous uh to you know, to CO2 capture if we could get the CO2, you know, to to to be in close proximity to these uh heterostructures.",

So I think nano emulsions, things like that, right? You could imagine that you could have excuse me, an emulsion where you have let's say uh I think as Jesus was mentioning, um you know, redox active materials on the outside of that emulsion, right? That come you contact with an electrode surface, you reduce that emulsion, you know, and then that emulsion wanders off and grabs CO2. All the CO2 is sucked inside of that emulsion and then either you can store it and use it for later. Um you might react it as I think Jesus was suggesting and it becomes an emotion full of some product that you might want to use for later or you can figure out a way to sort of reverse that emulsion and and kick the CO2 out either way. And that might be a super cool way to use encapsulation.",

I think it also overcomes some of the transport problems that we uh briefly discussed because you wouldn't have a much flowing dispersing uh fluid. Yeah, I mean as long as you sort of have these I think the trouble with the transport is always 2D versus 3D, right? You know, like if you're trying to flux to a surface that stinks as compared to trying to you know flux through a three-dimensional system. So you can imagine if this emulsion you could then hopefully like get gas fluxing through it, right? Um and then you only use the 2D surface for grabbing electrons or or throwing them back. Mhm.",

I don't know if anyone's explored that or if he's explored that either. Who's Phil Jessup? Uh he's a guy who does uh CO2 switchable solvents. Let me put his uh website. I mean so just so you know if you if you follow uh hits on your website. I've been googling all you guys to figure out what you guys do. You'll be getting hits from me at least today. Um and then I'll put that in the chat, but related to that also and I have a question to you about ionic liquids. Are there any ionic liquids that have high solubility for CO2 and very low for O2? as a way to so could you use that as a way to concentrate uh you know, basically your local concentration of O2 is low based on solubility.",
