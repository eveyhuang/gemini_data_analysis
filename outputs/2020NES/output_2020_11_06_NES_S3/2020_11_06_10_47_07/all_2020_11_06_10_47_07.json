I think this is this is the key uh challenge to tackle here before we think about the follow-up uh follow-up treatment.

Yeah. So there are a lot of constraint here that doesn't allow you to go be also beyond your expertise, right? And you have to think really out of the box, but it looks like that you know, titanium with UV could work because I remember that Julia showed like painting buildings, right? With titanium oxide or dressing some nice t-shirt or pants that helps, you know, to remove CH4. I don't know if they could this could be helpful, but you know, you should be something because this is too, but we are six billion of people around. So if someone maybe just just one t-shirt per time. Maybe this one can help. Could be a solution and it's you know, completely negative. Except if you're not going to consider how much CO2 we are going to emit to produce that kind of material.

It's as exactly as all of you mentioned Chong and Jeff and Samara. That's super difficult because the activation barrier to go over to activate to make it the methanol is already going can make the methanol go over the barrier further and getting over oxidized to CO or CO2. So that's a big challenge in the field, but there there are ways around it, I think.",

It's hard because I'm working a lot with thermo chemical processes where I use high temperature and so I was thinking, okay, yeah, you know what? We can make like silver membrane where we can remove oxygen, right? And so removing oxygen at 21%, maybe will be not 21%, will be like 19% removed and so we can just a little bit increase the percentage of CO2, the concentration of CO2 in the air and the methane in the air, but still you have methane, nitrogen and CO2. And then you have to cool down because this process works at 400 degrees Celsius. And then you have to cool down and then you can process the CO2 and then you will end and you then you will end with nitrogen CH4 and then with the membrane where hopefully you will have like 1, 2%, you can capture or you can separate methane in a kind of separate series and parallel stages, you know? I'm not saying that it's impossible. I'm just saying that at the end of the day we have to be still negative, right? And we can make a process work. I we can do that.
