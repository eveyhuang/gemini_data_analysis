It's kind of nice for silicon because that protects the surface from corrosion but it's the other way is you stop the photochemistry right there. But to further along the conversion to make it all the way into things like aldehyde or CO2, you sort of have to have a very high oxidative driving force and OH radical is the way to go. Actually that is the reaction pathway of the stratosphere getting rid of the methane and but it takes a long time because there's not so many radicals right there. So if you can actually create radicals to to activate the methane I think that can create the strongly bounded methoxy that can bound to the surface. So speaking of that we are looking at the iron oxide because that's a smaller band gap it absorbs the light almost in the green and the orange region. So you have lots of them in the photons in the sunlight. So that you can activate that and also the iron oxide is also having this very similar to the methane monooxygenase is a di-iron center of their certain crystal facets so you can potentially absorb that way.

So I guess such an absorptive methane sorry such an absorptive membrane needs to go through maybe multi-stage process of absorbing the methane and then activate it and then regenerate it because you don't you don't have a whole lot of it it's just like catalyst of a glove box so you don't regenerate every day you just regenerate once per year so that kind of thing.
