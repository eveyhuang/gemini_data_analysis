It's kind of nice for silicon because that protect the surface from corrosion, but it's the other way is you stop the photochemistry right there. But to further along the conversion to make it all the way into things like aldehyde or CO2, um you sort of have to have a very high oxidative driving force and OH radical is the way to go. Actually that is the reaction pathway of the stratosphere getting rid of the methane.",

Um I think no matter what source we're considering the ultra low concentration of methane is an issue and regardless of the follow-up technology, we have to find a way to address that now is either by membrane by sorbents. Uh but any any somehow a separation technology that somehow you can concentrate increase this concentration. I think this is this is the key uh challenge to tackle here before we think about the follow-up uh follow-up treatment. Um so I think that's one of the options would be like what we do with regards to CO2 is to come up with um materials that have dual functionalities, materials that have absorption functionalities as well as catalytic functionalities. But yes, uh this is also very extremely challenging, but I guess um that's that might work as well.",

So um perhaps uh we can do this is a looping chemical looping technique. It's it's uh two different states and they regenerate the active size afterwards. So I guess such absorptive methane so sorry, such absorptive membrane uh needs to go through maybe multi-stage process of absorbing the methane and then activate it and then regenerate it because you don't you don't have a whole lot of it. It's just like catalyst of a glove box so you don't regenerate every day, you just regenerate once per year. So that kind of thing. So once you have a big loading of your active sites, but you're not going to use it up uh very quickly, but but actually convert it later to some useful things.",

But if you're going to do the calculation, you know, from cradle to grave, maybe we we will realize we are not anymore negative. We are producing more waste than not what we are removing from air. Yeah. So there are a lot of constraint here that doesn't allow you to go be also beyond your expertise, right? And you have to think really out of the box, but it looks like that you know, titanium with UV could work because I remember that Julia showed like painting buildings, right? With titanium oxide or dressing some nice t-shirt or pants that helps, you know, to remove CH4. I don't know if they could this could be helpful, but you know, you should be something because this is too, but we are six billion of people around. So if someone maybe just just one t-shirt per time. Maybe this one can help. Could be a solution and it's you know, completely negative. Except if you're not going to consider how much CO2 we are going to emit to produce that kind of material. So, you know, it's always a loop and you have always to be careful on what you're proposing because it looks like that when you're going to do the integral, it looks like that your integral is not anymore negative, but is again positive.",
