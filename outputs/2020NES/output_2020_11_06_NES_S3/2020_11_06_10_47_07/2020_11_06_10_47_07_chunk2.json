            "transcript": "So the there's a big field in heterogeneous catalysis for what they call partial oxidation of methane. And they that's almost like a water splitting as a holy grail for photochemistry. For for that is the methane to methanol is a holy grail for for that. It's as exactly as all of you mentioned, Chong and Jeff and Samara. That's super difficult because the activation barrier to go over to activate to make it the methanol is already going can make the methanol go over the barrier further and getting over-oxidized to CO or CO2. So that's a big challenge in the field. But there are there are ways around it I think. But I think the low-hanging fruit is to to get to CO2 and capture it and then if there are better ways like the two-stage and the second stage is to control the surface reactivity and make methanol or useful products.",
