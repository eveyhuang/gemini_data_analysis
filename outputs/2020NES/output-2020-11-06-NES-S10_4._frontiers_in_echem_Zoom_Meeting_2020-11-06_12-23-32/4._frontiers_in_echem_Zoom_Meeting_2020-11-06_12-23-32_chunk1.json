            "transcript": "Okay, maybe maybe I'll start. Um, I never I just never shared a screen, so, um, so I will take the second part of the question, uh, which is on how can their discovery and optimize the CD accelerated? Um, I think electrochemistry, uh, in terms of a discipline, um, is uh, one where progress has been extraordinarily slow, uh, which is because of the fact that it's very complex system, many interacting components, uh, leading to learning, uh, and by learning I mean, okay, you do some experiment or you do some simulation and you want to answer some hypothesis, right? And often the ratio of the number of number of experiments or number of uh, simulations run to test a hypothesis is very, very high. Um, and that has to do with the fact that getting high quality data is very difficult. So I think here, uh, I think there's going to be a significant, um, advancement possible, uh, especially, you know, uh, especially in this sort of very complex space of CO2 where you have many different, uh, control variables, many different design variables. So I think, uh, robotic fermentation and machine learning, I think is going to fundamentally alter this this space and it's going to be a frontier that electrochemistry, uh, could be very, uh, well positioned to to spearhead, uh, because, um, a lot of the setups, uh, that we need, uh, actually are conducive for, uh, being able to do automated experiments and and may not require like, uh, you know, uh, human handling and so on. Like doing things with like robotic arms and so on is much harder than being able to automate like flow through type setups. So, uh, I think that that aspect I think could be, uh, one that I feel very passionately about as sort of the next frontier for electrochemistry.",

So I think that these are things that are um self similar and iterative in a very positive way that, you know, this kind of screening of catalysts can also be used to screen feed stock.",

Um, we uh, focus a lot in our group on trying to understand uh, the mechanism pathways to figure out which are the key steps because often times selectivity for example is determined at some common intermediate either reactant or product for example. And that sort of dictates what happens in the rest of the reaction. So I think, um, I I'm very in favor of um, using machine learning uh, to help us discover catalyst.",

Throughput computing combined with, you know, machine learning or trying to understand, you know, what targeted properties we are looking for. For example, a lot of good electrocatalyst are available, right? We also want to make sure is there a route to also find cost effective materials. For example, platinum is not going to be the only answer every time for instance we try to do something like this. Quite famously, you know, system to use water well but you're not going to sequester carbon dioxide using platinum. That's where probably machine learning or you know, modeling can also work with experiment to try to optimize.",

So, you know, in all of these cases, we need to run our oxidations opposite reductions and so you need to think about compatible reactions that are going to run on similar scales. Uh, and you know, basically how to sort of match match your chemistries, uh, so that we're not doing, you know, if we're doing a reduction, do we really just want to make O2 with the other electrode or do we want to incorporate some value added oxidation? What are the logistics and kind of what what reactions or combinations of reactions that we we choose to pair with with a larger scale one.",
