But I think the the topic here really calls for our serious consideration of what electrochemistry cannot do now. Or in other words, uh, what other fields that we can learn from that electrochemistry can do, uh, which really boost the the outreach of electrochemistry. Um, for example, what we can learn from the hydrogenous catalysis is that these reactions happen at elevated temperature. Can we drive the electrochemistry at elevated temperature in the gas phase or in the vapor phase?",
