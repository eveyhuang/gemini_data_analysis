Like, couldn't you tap into those kind of systems to get an idea of CO2 measurements for placement and also for optimization of a city-wide system?",

            "transcript": "So, urban cities, great idea. I totally agree with you. Another thing is people are also looking at direct air capture inside of buildings. There are many other things you can do because inside buildings has a lot higher concentration of CO2 than outside. We are point sources of CO2. In your room, much higher than 410 ppm, right? So people are looking into this. But the reason historically DAC was developed kind of a rural area or non-urban setting is because one of the benefit of DAC is that you can co-locate CO2 storage site with the CO2 capture site so that you can eliminate the transportation between, right? So there's a huge saving of that. So let's say if you have a place for injection of CO2, which is usually not in the city, this is where you want to build, like Iceland, middle of nowhere. So there are pros and cons involved. Those are good questions.",

Is that correct? You need a huge source of gas or coal fired waste heat, in order to, well, not waste heat, but heat in order to do the catalytic process. So if you put them in cities and you run it off electricity, it's not as, not nearly as efficient.",

I'm sure you're thinking about it. Until now, when you develop CO2 capture materials, regardless point source or deck, you have to put energy in. So binding energy, pulling it down, you have to put energy back in. That's a regeneration part and that's where you're going to get that energy is very critical for your net carbon sink as well as energy penalty and all that.",

They're saying, oh, it's free to come along, right? But if you're middle of nowhere, now you have to burn something or create that heat to do that. So that's why all the discussion Kristen is talking about. But at the same time, should we really use heat to regenerate? That's a new question a lot of people are asking. So until now, to provide energy, they're doing either temperature swing or pressure swing or combination. But can we use microwave? Can we use plasma? Can we use radio frequency? There, only thing you have to do is deliver the energy to which is binding onto CO2. That's a material question. Can that be non-thermal? That's a huge question in there. That's one thing a lot of research is going in that direction. Second, Gary's question, right now, economically, the best thing to do is enhanced oil recovery because there is a market for it, for sure.",
