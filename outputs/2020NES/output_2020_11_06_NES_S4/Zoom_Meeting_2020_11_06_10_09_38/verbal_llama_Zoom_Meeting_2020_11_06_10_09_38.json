So I'll start. I'm Roger Aines. I am the chief scientist of the energy program at Lawrence Livermore National Lab which is one of the US national labs.

I don't have too much experience with industry but maybe someone can chime in. What type of lifetime we want to achieve for catalyst for CO2 conversion? So I think the to me my limited knowledge seems the testing time for CO2 catalyst right now is about maybe I guess up to 100 hours at the moment which is apparently not good enough for scale up or long-term application. And also the I would add a different comment to Feng's comment. I think the the product selectivity, like you are doing any catalysis, selectivity is a very important, it's key, and which affects the ending purification, right? Purification is a very costly, expensive step towards final product. So I think that's two cents I would like to share. ",
