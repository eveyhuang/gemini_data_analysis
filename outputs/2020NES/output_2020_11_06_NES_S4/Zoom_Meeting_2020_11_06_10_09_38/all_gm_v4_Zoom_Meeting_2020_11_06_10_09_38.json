I don't have too much experience with industry but maybe someone can chime in. What type of lifetime we want to achieve for catalyst for CO2 conversion? So I think the to me my limited knowledge seems the testing time for CO2 catalyst right now is about maybe I guess up to 100 hours at the moment which is apparently not good enough for scale up or long-term application. And also the I would add a different comment to Feng's comment. I think the the product selectivity, like you are doing any catalysis, selectivity is a very important, it's key, and which affects the ending purification, right? Purification is a very costly, expensive step towards final product. So I think that's two cents I would like to share.",

You know for for scientific speaking of course we are we are scientists we are very interested in how to how to play with the selectivity how to improve the production rate but for business it's totally different thing.
