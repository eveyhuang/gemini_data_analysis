Thank you. It's because the conductivity is low and then you have a lot of resistance in the electrolyzer field.",

The challenge the practical challenge is when you're trying to sell a product your byproduct will become an issue a reliability to your company for example if you operate a company. So you have to find is usually you will do is to find some someone will willing to take it and often time you will run into certain troubles so you have to sell at lower than the market price that will become a big issue when you're trying to operate a business. You know for for scientific speaking of course we are we are scientists we are very interested in how to how to play with the selectivity how to improve the production rate but for business it's totally different thing. And also you know if you look at the current chemical industry how people really doing these kind of process design usually they produce multiple products and they do the separation process and then separate out and they sell them separately or they integrate into a downstream process trying to make a high value chemicals. This is what why usually if you look at a chemical plant they have so many processes going on at the same time.",

            "transcript": "I think it's important that that Jenny brought this up because I think it depends on what the goal is. I think there is a mismatch because the current narrative for CO2 reduction is we want to make a product that is high enough in value so that doing this transformation which is not super efficient makes sense. So then everyone runs for ethylene and a few other products where there is an economic case. But then if we think a little bit forward like like Jenny suggested if we actually want to make a fuel product then that is a whole different story right because I think Jenny has a point if we have like ethanol propanol we all know that these can be fuel additives. Then selectivity might not matter so much anymore.",

Most of time using anion exchange membranes they just don't like alcohols.",
