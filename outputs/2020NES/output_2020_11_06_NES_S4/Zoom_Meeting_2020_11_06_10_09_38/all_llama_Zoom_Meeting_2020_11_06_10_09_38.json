So I'll start. I'm Roger Aines. I am the chief scientist of the energy program at Lawrence Livermore National Lab which is one of the US national labs. And I work pretty much full time on negative emissions technologies and pertinent to this breakout one of our biggest efforts is in electrochemical reduction although we don't do much on the actual catalysis we build the catalysis the the catalyst into bigger reactors mostly using additive manufacturing.

So if you think about the scalable conversion of carbon dioxide at meaningful industry scale, you have to think about the lifetime of your catalyst and associated with the cost of catalyst. I don't have too much experience with industry but maybe someone can chime in. What type of lifetime we want to achieve for catalyst for CO2 conversion? So I think the to me my limited knowledge seems the testing time for CO2 catalyst right now is about maybe I guess up to 100 hours at the moment which is apparently not good enough for scale up or long-term application. And also the I would add a different comment to Feng's comment. I think the the product selectivity, like you are doing any catalysis, selectivity is a very important, it's key, and which affects the ending purification, right? Purification is a very costly, expensive step towards final product. So I think that's two cents I would like to share.",
