            "transcript": "can play a role. So currently many people just use simplified computational methods. This may work well for certain materials but not for all the materials. In some situations for example if you use single metal atom catalysts then we must include the factors such as surface charge and solvation effects. So I think it's important to develop and use better computational models which can take care of those complex factors into the modeling. And another issue about current modeling method is that they often neglect the kinetics because of the computational complexity. So they often just give you the thermodynamics and then use the thermodynamics to estimate the kinetics. But we know that it's the kinetics that's more directly relevant to the reaction rate. So it's very important for us computational chemists to develop good models so that we can directly calculate the kinetics such as the activation energies and that will give us better understanding especially when combined with the experiments. And that's actually one major effort that my group is putting into and hope to get some advances in this field.",

            "transcript": "I'd add to that that a lot of the heterogeneous catalysts, we don't necessarily know what the active site is, and there may be a whole bunch of different active sites that have different reactivity, different product selectivity, and from the computational side you have to model every single one of those separately to actually have any clue. I also wanted to loop back to just a bigger picture question. We were talking about fuels earlier. To me that kind of strikes me as almost counterproductive to the goal of negative emissions because if we're taking the carbon, we're sucking it out of the atmosphere and turning it into a fuel so that we can put it back into the atmosphere, is that really negative emissions?",
