I'd like to add to the a sentence to the introduction this morning is there's something you'd like to see done in this breakout that you know as an outcome or as a process or whatever if there's something about the way that we do this that you'd like to add please add it. So I'll start. I'm Roger Aines. I am the chief scientist of the energy program at Lawrence Livermore National Lab which is one of the US national labs. And I work pretty much full time on negative emissions technologies and pertinent to this breakout one of our biggest efforts is in electrochemical reduction although we don't do much on the actual catalysis we build the catalysis the the catalyst into bigger reactors mostly using additive manufacturing. So that's my background. We'll go next to Feng.",
