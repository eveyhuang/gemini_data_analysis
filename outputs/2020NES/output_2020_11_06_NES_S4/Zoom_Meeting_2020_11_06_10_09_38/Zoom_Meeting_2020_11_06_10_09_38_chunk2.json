We also study metal oxide interfaces which are primarily relevant in like lithium and sodium conducting oxides at the interface with the pure metals. For this conference, I am pretty interested in looking at electrical and electrochemical properties of interfaces as they pertain to reactions with CO2. So we do various types of high resolution structural imaging in the electron microscope and spectroscopy. Nice to meet you all.",

I'll make one that is sort of the reflection of that is what are the barriers to success here? There's an enormous amount of literature around catalysis, a lot of electrochemistry. What are the barriers to moving that into, you know, really cleaning up the atmosphere? So that's my request. Do we have other thoughts on sort of what you want to get out of this right now?",

And then how, you know, of the things that we know right now, what are the, what are we most far from to make those metrics? So in my opinion, it's better catalyst, but also, you know, being able to deal with either the low concentration of CO2 in the air, right? Because we're talking about CO2 reduction. And we, in our labs, look at catalysts using a tank that we buy that's high purity. And I know firsthand that, you know, if we have less high purity or oxygen air assist them, then everything goes to hell. So if we want to move towards more practicality, we have to think about the low concentration in our feedstock so that the process becomes more efficient.",

So depending on the concentration of your feedstock, you might be wanting to be looking in a different kind of chemical space for your capture thermodynamics, right? So, that's one thing. And then in addition to that, you also have use of oxygen tolerance, right? If you're going to try to do direct air capture and air kills your capturing chemical locus, then that's a huge problem. So there are some hurdles there in thermodynamics and then also kind of stability of the systems that we're studying.",

We can do it at some level in the lab scale, but then when you try to scale up any of these processes, we don't really have an understanding of how to put electrons, ions, how to put CO2, how to put liquid water, how to put a solid electrode, and how to make these at a large scale.

So CO2 is so big, the scale is just not the same scale as the chemicals we try to make. Probably fuel is the only thing we actually produce at a similar scale. So it's really a question about where's the energy coming from? Is the life cycle actually make sense for whatever we're trying to do here? I think have a good understanding of from the economic side, from the life cycle side will definitely help us to really think about what kind of technology we really need.",

So if you think about the scalable conversion of carbon dioxide at meaningful, you know, industrial scale, you have to think about the lifetime of your catalyst and associated with the cost of catalyst. I don't have too much experience with industry, but maybe someone can share me in. What type of life of time we want to achieve for counts for CO2 conversion? So I think they, to me, my niche technology seems, you know, the testing time for CO2 counter right now is about maybe I guess up to 100 hours at moment. So which is apparently not good enough for scale up or long-term application. And also the, I would add this comes to French comment. I think the, the product selectivity. Like you are doing any catalysis, selectivity is very important key and which affect the ending purification, right? Purification is a very, you know, expensive step towards final product. So I think that's two since I would like to share.",

And once the temperature, once your experiment is no longer isothermal, then any sort of mechanistic analysis that you're doing does have this unknown factor that can lead to irreproducibility. And so, long lifetime catalysts are great, but trying to study them may have all of these additional factors that people have not yet fully understood or flushed out. So it's also a matter of having the basic chemistry being interfaced with engineering. Chemical engineers have been thinking about reactor technology for a long time and heat management and mass transport. And I think that that's, I guess, for me right now, a huge, huge gap.",
