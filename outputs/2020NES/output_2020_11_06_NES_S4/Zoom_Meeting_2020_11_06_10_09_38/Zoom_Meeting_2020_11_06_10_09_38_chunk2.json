We also study metal oxide interfaces which are primarily relevant in lithium and sodium conducting oxides at the interface with the pure metals. For this conference, I'm pretty interested in looking at electrical and electrochemical properties of interfaces as they pertain to reactions with CO2. So we do various types of high resolution structural imaging in the electron microscope and spectroscopy. Nice to meet you all.",

What are the barriers to moving that into you know really cleaning up the atmosphere? So that's my request. Do we have other thoughts on the sort of what you want to get out of this right now?",

So what needs to happen and then you know of the things that we know right now, what are we most far from to make those metrics? So in my opinion, it's better catalysts but also being able to deal with either the low concentration of CO2 in the air, right because we're talking about CO2 reduction and we in our lab look at catalysts using a tank that we buy that's high purity. And I know firsthand that if we have less high purity or oxygen in our system that everything goes to hell. So we want to move towards more practicality, we have to think about the low concentration in our feedstock so that the process becomes more efficient.",

So that's one thing. And then in addition to that, you also have the issue of oxygen tolerance, right? If you're going to try to do direct air capture and air kills your your capturing chemical locus, then that's that's a huge problem. So there's some some hurdles there in thermodynamics and then also kind of stability of the systems that we're studying.",

So most of the chemistry that we're interested in is in liquids, includes liquid electrodes, electrolytes, and I don't think we really know how to manage those gases. We can do it at some level in the lab scale, but then when you try to scale up any of these processes, we don't really have an understanding of how to put electrons, ions, how to put CO2, how to put liquid water, how to put a solid electrode and how to make this at a large scale.

So CO2 is so big, the scale is just not the same scale as the chemicals we're trying to make. Probably fuel is the only thing we actually produce at a similar scale. So it's really a question about where's the energy coming from, is the life cycle actually make sense for whatever we're trying to do here. I think have a good understanding of from the economic side, from the life cycle side will definitely help us to really think about what kind of technology we really need.",

So if you think about the scalable conversion of carbon dioxide at meaningful industry scale, you have to think about the lifetime of your catalyst and associated with the cost of catalyst. I don't have too much experience with industry but maybe someone can chime in. What type of lifetime we want to achieve for catalyst for CO2 conversion? So I think the to me my limited knowledge seems the testing time for CO2 catalyst right now is about maybe I guess up to 100 hours at the moment which is apparently not good enough for scale up or long-term application. And also the I would add a different comment to Feng's comment. I think the the product selectivity, like you are doing any catalysis, selectivity is a very important, it's key, and which affects the ending purification, right? Purification is a very costly, expensive step towards final product. So I think that's two cents I would like to share.",

And once your experiment is no longer isothermal, then any sort of mechanistic analysis that you're doing does have this unknown factor that can lead to irreproducibility. And so long lifetime catalysts are great, but trying to study them may have all of these additional factors that people have not yet fully understood or flushed out. So it's also a matter of having the basic chemistry being interfaced with engineering. Chemical engineers",
