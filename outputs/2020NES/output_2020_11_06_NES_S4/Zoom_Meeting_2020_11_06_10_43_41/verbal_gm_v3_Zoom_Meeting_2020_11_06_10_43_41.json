But of course, surface-enhanced Raman, tip-enhanced Raman type things, you're limited by sticking some sort of metal tip or something in there. I also did want to loop back to Gary's point about the catalysts that are easier to measure not necessarily being the best ones. From the computational side, I don't see that as necessarily being a problem because if we have somewhere where we can validate our methods and figure out what features do need to be included and don't need to be included, even if it's not the best catalyst, then that's still really valuable for us.
