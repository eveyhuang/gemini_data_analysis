So they have a recent review paper just publishing science, I think a couple weeks ago. you can read that one. So they have a stable performance over thousand hours. the main product with CO. because at high temperature you can't produce any multi carbon product. CO is the only thing you will get. Uh, of course they have these challenges issues with coke formation and also they have these durability issues. but they already prove they can run thousand hours, right? There's nothing we can complain say low temperature can run much longer than that. we don't.

So if you're trying to interrogate um a mechanism of CO2 conversion or capture in a liquid phase, you know, there's a certain amount of tools that you use like you could do online liquid IR, you could do NMR, whereas once you go into the gas phase, you know, um um the the the methodology is going to be different, right?
