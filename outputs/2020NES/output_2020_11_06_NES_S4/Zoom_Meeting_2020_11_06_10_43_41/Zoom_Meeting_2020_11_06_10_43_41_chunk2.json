You want to you want to keep carbon monoxide on the surface right? You want to make hydrocarbons right? So you want the CO on the surface. But the problem is you have an isotherm. You go hot you push the CO away. And then you have more sites for for hydrogen generation. And so then you need to up your pressure and so I was doing CO2 reduction at a thousand to 500 PSI of CO2 reduction. Which then completely changes your mechanistic regime. So this is a can of worms this is terrible like it drove me almost mad. So just that's all I'm saying. It's like I've been a little bit around this challenge. Things go very very crazy very very quickly. So we know this reaction around room temperature ambient pressure but as you start moving away from there I think there's a lot of space to explore. I hope this answers your question.",

You can read that one. So they have a stable performance over a thousand hours. The main product is CO because at high temperature you can't produce any multi-carbon product. CO is the only thing you will get. Of course they have these challenge issues with coke formation and also they have this durability issues but they already proved they can run a thousand hours right? It's nothing we can complain say low temperature can run much longer than that we don't. So the only difference I think between low temperature versus high temperature is that low temperature actually give us opportunity to do more interesting chemistry that cannot do at high temperature. But high temperature is definitely has some unique features there.",

Ceramic has this horrible property you have to heat up and cool down very slowly otherwise they may crack then you are done. So we actually at one point of time we think about doing this kind of experiment but we give up because one experiment just take way longer than if you do low temperature you probably can do multiple within a day.

Right? So if you're trying to interrogate a mechanism of CO2 conversion or capture in the liquid phase you know there's a certain amount of tools that you use like you could do online liquid IR you could do NMR whereas once you go into the gas phase you know the methodology is going to be different right? So aside from the chemistry itself you know that the study of the reactions also kind of has a different tool set right? And you know some of us are probably very familiar with the liquid analysis with some some gas here and there but",
