Then you will see unless you're able to do both things at the same time, spectroscopy and product detection, it's very difficult to relate the the activity and selectivity of one catalyst that we see in a reactor to what you see in in during the spectroscopy analysis. So it's challenging but I see obviously people working on this efforts and yeah, it's a challenge. ",
