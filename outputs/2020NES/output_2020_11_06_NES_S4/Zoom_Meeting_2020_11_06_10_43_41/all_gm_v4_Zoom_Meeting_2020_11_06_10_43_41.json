You can read that one. So they have a stable performance over a thousand hours. The main product is CO because at high temperature you can't produce any multi-carbon product. CO is the only thing you will get. Of course they have these challenge issues with coke formation and also they have this durability issues but they already proved they can run a thousand hours right? It's nothing we can complain say low temperature can run much longer than that we don't. So the only difference I think between low temperature versus high temperature is that low temperature actually give us opportunity to do more interesting chemistry that cannot do at high temperature. But high temperature is definitely has some unique features there.",
