Uh on heterogeneous surfaces it was pointed out this gets trickier because you have multiple sites and and then there's going to be multiple barriers that you're thinking about for for different processes that are occurring. Um in terms of over potentials, those are related to to the activity. And so there's multiple over potentials for what activity you want to get. At least in the field of homogeneous electrocatalysis, I think there these things are a little bit more worked out in terms of their tafel relationships and extracting rate constants for uh for a process or a maximum turnover frequency. And in principle you can relate that back then to activation energies uh uh if you if you take into account the iring relationship.",

So my understanding the definition over potential is defined as the the the thermodynamic potential uh you are going to have to either make hydrogen or make CO2. So no matter so uh that's how I how I understand this over potential. But if you talk about current based over potential because uh that's how that's the way how people report the data. But the true meaning of over potential is always compared to the uh the thermodynamic potential at you know, kind of equilibrium uh equilibrium potential at the uh you know, test conditions. So, like for example, for hydrogen evolution at different pH value, your thermodynamic potential are different for hydrogen evolution. Okay. Yeah, that's that's that's what I have thought about the uh over potential.",

Thank you, Jenny. I I I'm enjoying this conversation because it it seems to loop in everybody in the room that they're both experimental and calculational and monitoring and measurement issues associated with this over potential question. I I thought it was I thought it was kind of fascinating because as a as a a geologist, I never think about anything in kinetic terms. Everything's always in equilibrium. So all these kinetic stuff is like, what are you talking about? Um so I I I would encourage you to continue this discussion.",

I had a question because I feel like this was sort of brought up with uh a computational from computational what are the active sites? And I feel like that is something that we what are what are what are the spectroscopic tools? And and if they exist what why aren't we using them? What are the what are the problems with that? Because I feel like that's something that comes up often in heterogeneous catalysis is um and what are what how can we solve or get a little bit closer to what that answer to that question is.",

Um there's a lot of work on going up into image let's say feature recognition from noisy images. So trying to push the capability of detection of the microscope in terms of understanding the surface structures and the location of absorbates at surface defects.",
