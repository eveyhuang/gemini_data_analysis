And you need to get rid of this heat. And if you're at if your device only works at room temperature, the only thing you can do is you need a compressor, you need to go cool.

So no matter so uh that's how I how I understand this over potential. But if you talk about current based over potential because uh that's how that's the way how people report the data. But the true meaning of over potential is always compared to the uh the thermodynamic potential at you know, kind of equilibrium uh equilibrium potential at the uh you know, test conditions. So, like for example, for hydrogen evolution at different pH value, your thermodynamic potential are different for hydrogen evolution. Okay.
