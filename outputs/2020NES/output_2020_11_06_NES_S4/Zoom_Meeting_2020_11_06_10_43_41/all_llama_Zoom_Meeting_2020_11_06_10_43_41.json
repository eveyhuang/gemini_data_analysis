You go hot you push the CO away. And then you have more sites for for hydrogen generation. And so then you need to up your pressure and so I was doing CO2 reduction at a thousand to 500 PSI of CO2 reduction. Which then completely changes your mechanistic regime. So this is a can of worms this is terrible like it drove me almost mad. So just that's all I'm saying. It's like I've been a little bit around this challenge. Things go very very crazy very very quickly. So we know this reaction around room temperature ambient pressure but as you start moving away from there I think there's a lot of space to explore.

It's nothing we can complain say low temperature can run much longer than that we don't.
