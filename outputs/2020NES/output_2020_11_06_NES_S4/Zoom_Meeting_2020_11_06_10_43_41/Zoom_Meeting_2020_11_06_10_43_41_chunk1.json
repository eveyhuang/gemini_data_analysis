Someone just told me that they were getting paid by a company to make oxalate and and bury that underground. So are there products that aren't necessarily fuels that would be useful because they're stable and we can put them in the ground and they're I mean are there sort of precursors to CO2 mineralization that we can make electrochemically?",

And okay I'll take a billion tons but that's nothing like what we need. So the question is is there some new thing we could do that 20 years from now we could be using an enormous amount of that would be a long-lived use of these things. That that one fascinates me.",

And the answer is you're not going to replace the existing feedstocks you're going to come in with new feedstocks and new processes and so they're they're very the the companies that are really engaged in this are Shell, ENI from Italy, Total, are investing very heavily in exactly that question and and what those processes should look like. Basically in Shell they call it new energy carriers. What's what's the thing that moves the energy around as you're saying store the energy how are you going to move it around. And it's absolutely not that the existing things and new things take a fascinating field of research but it touches that broadly in a lot of areas.",

The thing is there's a lot of things you can't make that way with high efficiency and and despite the fact that our fuels are mixes anybody at an oil company would be aghast at your statement that they're very very delicately created mixtures. So you know I think that the the use of thermal and electrochemical in the future will be some mixture of of those things. The electrochemical is purely to bring the renewable energy into into the refinery. How do we get electricity into a refinery?",

So that's certainly an area that within engineering I think needs to catch up. I don't know if other people have any thoughts on that.",

And I said oh room temperature clearly you must like this right? And they said that for a scale up process I don't know exactly how how how practices they would actually prefer that the the the process is run about 60 degrees and so when we talk about mechanisms and kinetics and thermodynamics we need to really think about this seriously and then we started thinking like okay well well can we induce heat resistively so we have a cell that's intentionally resistive that allows us to reach a certain temperature levels right?",
