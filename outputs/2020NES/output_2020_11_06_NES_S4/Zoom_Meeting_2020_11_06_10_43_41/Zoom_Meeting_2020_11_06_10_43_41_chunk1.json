You know, I I work with Andre Bardo a lot and his assessment is that there's only about a billion tons of CO2 emissions potential available in the whole chemical industry. And okay, I'll take a billion tons, but that's nothing like what we need. So the question is, is there some new thing we could do that 20 years from now we could be using an enormous amount of. It would be a long-lived use of these things. That that one fascinates me.",

And so they're they're very, the the companies that are really engaged in this are Shell, uh E&I from uh Italy, uh Total and France are investing very heavily in exactly that question and and what those processes should look like. Basically, in Shell, it's called new energy carrier. What what's the thing that moves the energy around as you were saying, to store the energy, how are you going to move it around?

And I said, oh, room temperature. Clearly you must like this, right? And so they said that um for a scale up process, I don't know exactly how how um how this process is. They would actually prefer that the the processes run about 60 degrees. And so when we talk about mechanisms and kinetics and thermodynamics, we need to really think about temperature seriously. And then we started thinking like, okay, well, well, can we induce heat resistively and have a cell that's intentionally resistive that allows us to reach a certain temperature level, right? And so that's kind of how we got down the rabbit hole of of trying to diagnose kind of how how thermal effects work. Um and um you know.",

The the real reasons like by engineers, that's kind of like my engineering kind of skin, right? By engineers like high temperatures is because there is the realization that whenever you run an electrochemical system, you will have so much resistance somewhere or even kinetic losses that this thing heats up. And you need to get rid of this heat. And if you're at if your device only works at room temperature, the only thing you can do is you need a compressor, you need to go cool.
