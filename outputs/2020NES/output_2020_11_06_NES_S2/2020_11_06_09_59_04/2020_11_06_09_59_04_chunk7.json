But so it's like these meetings like Gordon conference meetings where you really see a lot of these types of conversations happening.",

Getting back to Louisa's point you know I mean what if we decided that we were looking at materials that are going to be most useful for capturing carbon. And so you got everybody who's interested in that and you were focused on that and that was the meeting and then you had a bunch of tutorials from the experimental side from the theoretical side and then had people talk about this and figure out the right way to do these and who are the right people to collaborate to make progress on this.",

It's not that suddenly experimentalists have to learn the theory nor that theory knows everything. I think it has to be more this conversation we're trying to have here of what do you need what can you give us and what can we give you. So the tutorial idea makes me at least in my mind it makes me a little uneasy because as we were just saying it's definitely not down to the level of these are the tools and this is how you use them. It's just more of a conversation between everybody of what are the challenges what do we need to know what can you measure what can't you measure what can you compute what can't you compute you know that's what you're really talking about.",

            "transcript": "No that's exactly right. And so the problem that most theoreticians have when they read experimental papers is they don't know what the error bars are. And a lot of times experimentalists I was trained as an experimentalist so I started out life as an experimentalist sometimes we don't put our error bars we don't make it really prominent because we're trying to show our work off in the best light. It's a mistake. I mean because you need to know whether you've got an overlap between the theory and the experiment so that you know that you're you have confidence that you're basically getting it and what your error bars are when you do a simulation or whatever it is. So I agree completely. I mean it's got to be a two-way street and people need to know what are the best ways to look at these things experimentally and how do you trust your data.",

Like what are the big challenges that somebody today would want help with. I love interfaces I look at them for batteries and other things and there's a lot going on at them. Is that the main issue is it broadly the category of interfaces everywhere or I don't think it is because I also heard the issues of like solvents temperature thermal effects. So that's another way of looking at this like what couple of big questions are there that you just can't get to experimentally and why can't you get there. Because then you can say wait a minute okay we can add to this you know help you understand this problem. I think those are the things we need to talk about too instead of just broad here.",

You know you do your capture and then you feed whatever you captured off to some other process. And so I think that there's an opportunity especially as designing new systems to think about integrating those two and that will create some really unique interfaces because you have a material system that does both capture and conversion or capture and storage. I think that that could be a really interesting area for experimentalists and theorists and systems designs to all converge on one new unique problem.",
