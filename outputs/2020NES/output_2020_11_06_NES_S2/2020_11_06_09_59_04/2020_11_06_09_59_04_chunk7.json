And and and so you got everybody who's interested in that and you're focused on that and that was the meeting and then you had a bunch of tutorials from the experimental side, from the theoretical side and then had people talk about this and figure out, you know, the right way to do these and who are the right people to collaborate to make progress on this.",

And a lot of times experimentalists I was trained as an experimentalist. So I started that life as experimentalist. Sometimes we don't put our error bars, we don't make it really prominent because we're trying to show our work off in the best light. That's a mistake. I mean, because you know, you need to know whether you've got an overlap between the theory and the experiment so that you know that you're you're you have confidence that you're basically getting it and what your error bars are when you do a simulation or whatever it is. So I agree completely. I mean, it's got to be a two-way street and you know, people need to know um what what are the best ways to look at these things experimentally and how do you trust your data.",

Like what are the big challenges that somebody today would want help with? Like I like I love interfaces. I look at them for batteries and other things and there's a lot going on at them. Is that the main issue? Is it broadly the category of interfaces everywhere or I don't think it is because I also heard the issues of like solvents um temperature thermal effects. So that's another way of looking at this like what couple of big questions are there that you just can't get to experimentally and why can't you get there? Because then you can say, wait a minute, okay, we can add to this you know, help you understand this problem. I think those are the things we need to talk about too instead of just broad here.",

For experimentalist, we can use this uh software to predict spectrum for the experiment and for the following subsequent design or change those experiment. And also we can update it using our real data to to augment the whole design of the software. So this provide a channel for the two the the the the the the parallel uh contribution from the two two community.",

So I think working together to understand those things is great, but asking theorists for a tool that you can use to explore, you're going to very quickly break it is what I would guess, you know, depending on how how you kind of put values in.",
