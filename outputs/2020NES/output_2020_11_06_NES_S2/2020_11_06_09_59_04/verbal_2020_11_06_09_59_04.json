The the big question here about how do we facilitate this conversations? I mean, that's what research corporation is doing with this conversation because I think, you know, until you sit down and have conversations with people, the vocabularies are different and it's hard for people, you know, just by reading the paper to figure out can can I work in this area? And uh a half hour conversation can make it clear whether, you know, you could offer something to this and you might be able to do a collaboration. So, um, I mean more uh gatherings like this is definitely um was something that would be uh a great way to continue to facilitate those conversations and get down more into the nitty gritty. ",

They're expensive economically, they're expensive from a time standpoint. And the way I think about it is usually we do a life cycle assessment at the end of everything. But shouldn't we be doing it as a way to screen new materials. So you could start and say, you know, I'm thinking about these materials or I'm thinking about these methods and do a carbon balance. If the carbon doesn't work out, you know, it can point us to what materials or methods might be most advantageous from a negative emission standpoint. ",

If we think about the carbon in the atmosphere, 75% of it can be traced back to how we use it to make electric and thermal energy.
