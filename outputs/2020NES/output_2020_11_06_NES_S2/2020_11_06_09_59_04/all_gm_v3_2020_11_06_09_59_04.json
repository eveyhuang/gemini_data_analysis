And that gets back to I know I've heard a couple people say about multi-scale right so my modeling could help on a system level design perhaps how how fast the air is flowing what kind of thicknesses we want for these etc. But it's not unless I get parameterization or information from DFT or experiments I can't tell you exactly what the reactions look like right I need somebody to tell me that so I can integrate it. And then you also get into the issue which we haven't really brought up of or maybe we have a little bit uncertainty analysis or uncertainty and its propagation right so if you're doing a DFT model there's an uncertainty and you propagate that to MD there's an uncertainty if you make that big jump to trying to model a device what about all that uncertainty and you need to compound all that to understand I think you said it a moment ago Matt risk right the risk associated with this.",

So can you guys see that? So so we have this you know how do we facilitate conversations we're talking about defining a wish list for what experimentalists would like to be able to model perspective articles tutorial meetings. And then I was just trying to capture a lot what people were saying about specific challenges relevant to negative emission sciences so like maybe starting this wish list like a little some of these are like could be things that would be on that wish list. So modeling solvent effects simulating a reaction at a constant potential. So then maybe this is the what what would the theorist or the computational people like to be able to see like what inputs are they missing from to help sort of validate their theories. Is this seem and then some possible approaches that we've talked about you know talking about using computational approaches like life cycle assessment you know modeling energy requirements so this is what I think Andrea and Kristen were talking about using these sort of bigger systems level computational approaches to help guide the choices experimentalists make when they're trying to pursue various materials or approaches ruling out those that are not going to be viable but also and also defining benchmarks to meet to to get you into the sort of negative emissions zone. And then we talked about you know having sort of ideal like a combinations of sort of model experimental systems to really zero in on specific aspects of complex systems. Am I missing anything or what else or so here's kind of my picture of what we've talked about so far. So and so one thing maybe so we kind of when we're talking about specific challenges we a lot of it was like well here's what experimentalists would like to model. So is there anything else that from from the theoretical people who like gosh if we had if if the experimentalists could only give us this piece of data you know that would really help.",

It's not that suddenly experimentalists have to learn the theory nor that theory knows everything. I think it has to be more this conversation we're trying to have here of what do you need what can you give us and what can we give you. So the tutorial idea makes me at least in my mind it makes me a little uneasy because as we were just saying it's definitely not down to the level of these are the tools and this is how you use them. It's just more of a conversation between everybody of what are the challenges what do we need to know what can you measure what can't you measure what can you compute what can't you compute you know that's what you're really talking about.",
