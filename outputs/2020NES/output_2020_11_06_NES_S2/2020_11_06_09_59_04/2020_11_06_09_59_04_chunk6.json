So, yeah, all these prototypes are set up where there's waste heat that can help make the process more more efficient. In the let me throw out something else though that Kristen you just reminded me of about making other fuels. In the keynote yesterday, the speaker did talk about if you take CO2 and you're able to make it into a useful fuel, you're recycling your fuel I guess and that's you know she said that would be one of the the big wins, you know, if you could figure out how to make CH4 or some longer chain hydrocarbon, which means you need catalysts in order to do that. So then people have to be working on how do you, you know what do you do in in terms of making a better catalyst and put the right molecules together to try to make some fuels that would be useful and then you could start taking less stuff out of the ground.",

So one of the sessions yesterday the question came up about what's really net negative versus just offsetting current emissions and one of the funder one of the private funder takes on this was anything that just sort of displaces or or reduces our our current emissions is not in the same category to them as as a true net negative. And so I'm wondering if the the processes like capture turning it into fuel that will get burned again if the broader perspective of the the conference here is that those are also of interest or if if we have a really strict definition of negative emission.",

At the basic science level though I think mitigating sometimes is a step towards reduction right an actual negative emissions as the improvement of say a catalyst or a system gets better that that the version 0.5 is not in fact negative but is a is a necessary step in the basic science to get to version 2.0 which actually now achieves your goal.

So we talked about some strategies for facilitating I guess I can share maybe I'll share this screen here. Kind of see make sure I'm trying to capture the gist of what we're talking about. So can you guys see that? So so we have this you know how do we facilitate conversations we're talking about defining a wish list for what experimentalists would like to be able to model perspective articles tutorial meetings. And then I was just trying to capture a lot what people were saying about specific challenges relevant to negative emission sciences so like maybe starting this wish list like a little some of these are like could be things that would be on that wish list. So modeling solvent effects simulating a reaction at a constant potential. So then maybe this is the what what would the theorist or the computational people like to be able to see like what inputs are they missing from to help sort of validate their theories. Is this seem and then some possible approaches that we've talked about you know talking about using computational approaches like life cycle assessment you know modeling energy requirements so this is what I think Andrea and Kristen were talking about using these sort of bigger systems level computational approaches to help guide the choices experimentalists make when they're trying to pursue various materials or approaches ruling out those that are not going to be viable but also and also defining benchmarks to meet to to get you into the sort of negative emissions zone. And then we talked about you know having sort of ideal like a combinations of sort of model experimental systems to really zero in on specific aspects of complex systems. Am I missing anything or what else or so here's kind of my picture of what we've talked about so far. So and so one thing maybe so we kind of when we're talking about specific challenges we a lot of it was like well here's what experimentalists would like to model. So is there anything else that from from the theoretical people who like gosh if we had if if the experimentalists could only give us this piece of data you know that would really help.",
