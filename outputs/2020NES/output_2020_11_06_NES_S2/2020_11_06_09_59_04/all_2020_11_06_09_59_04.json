Um the the immediate thing that I think of is is just writing sort of perspective kind of articles where you get people who who maybe do work at at the interfaces more so so people who work with really well defined experimental systems. Um you know, just just trying to put out there in in a very uh clear clear way, you know, this this is basically as good as an experimental system gets.

And if you don't have somebody to break it down for you, you know, so I guess that it goes back to the education component because we're at least in most places we don't teach this um early on.

And and the cost and the time, etc with doing that is is great, right? And so especially with with COVID, things are shutting down even further, but can you use computational methods to help accelerate that design and make it more effective and efficient so that you're spending your time and money more wisely. And that gets back to I know I heard a couple people say about multi scale, right? So my modeling could help on a system level design perhaps, how how fast the air is flowing, what kind of thicknesses we want for these, etc. But it's not unless I get parameterization or information from DFT or experiments, I can't tell you exactly what the reactions look like, right? I I need somebody to tell me that so I can and then you also get into the issue which really brought up of or maybe we have a little bit uncertainty analysis or uncertainty and its propagation, right? So if you're doing a DFT model, there's uncertainty and you propagate that to MD, there's uncertainty. If you make that big jump to trying to model device, what about all that uncertainty? And you need to compound all that to understand I think you said it moment ago Matt, risk, right? The risk of associated with this.",

If we think about the carbon in the atmosphere, 75% of it can be traced back to how we use it to make electric and thermal energy. And so I think the step forward in negative emissions technologies is some kind of system that has reduced energy requirements. I mean towards uh Adam's comment about uh like perspective pieces, one of the the National Academies put out a study on direct air carbon removal systems and they had uh the from what I I don't model this directly, I model the energy requirements. So the the biggest thing problem that I see now is the high uh thermal process requirements. You have to have the solvents or the sorbins at like 900 degrees Celsius and to get there you need to burn a lot of natural gas. So what is there a way to make the capture process more energy efficient from a materials perspective or uh yeah, I don't know.",

And, uh, uh, that's you know, she said that would be one of the the big wins, you know, if you could figure out how to make CH4 or some longer chain hydrocarbon, which means you need catalysts, um, to in order to do that.

Um, and then I was just trying to capture a lot what people were saying about specific challenges uh relevant to negative emission sciences. So like maybe starting this wish list, like a little some of these are like could be things that would be on that wish list. So modeling solvent effects, simulating a reaction at constant potential. Um, about so then maybe this is the what what would the the theorists or the computational people like to be able to see like what inputs are they missing from to help sort of validate their theories. Um, does this seem? And then some possible approaches that we've talked about, we talked about using computational approaches like life cycle assessment, you know, modeling energy requirements. So this is what um I think Andrea and Kristen were talking about, you know, using these sort of bigger system level um computational approaches to help guide the choices experimentalists make when they're trying to pursue various materials or approaches. Um, ruling out those that are not going to be viable but also and also defining benchmarks to meet to to get you into the sort of negative emissions zone. Um, am I missing anything? what else or So here's kind of my picture of what we've talked about so far.",

And I I think it's a real problem in the academy because, you know, assistant professors feel like they're always being judged and that they have to be the smartest person in the room. And so you go to a ACS meeting and, you know, it starts up here and then it finishes up here and most of the people in the audience are lost in the first five minutes except for the people who are really, you know, tuned into that. So I think this idea of having the tutorial sessions followed by um discussions and just a lot more question and answer where people don't feel um threatened like they have to be uh, you know, know everything, right? So otherwise, how do we get to a point where people can even understand what each other is talking about and being able to say, oh, so you're so you're saying that you could model this with your with with your experiment or with your with your theory and, you know, yes or no or maybe, you know, might be the answer, but the getting that dialogue going, I think um is hard because of the way academia is set up.
