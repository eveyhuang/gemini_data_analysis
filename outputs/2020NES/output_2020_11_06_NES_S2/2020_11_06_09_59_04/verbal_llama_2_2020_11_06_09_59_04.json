So you could start and say you know I'm thinking about these materials or I'm thinking about these methods and do a carbon balance if the carbon doesn't work out you know it can point us to what materials or methods might be most advantageous from a negative emission standpoint and then further focus our experimental methods on those.

So can you guys see that? So so we have this you know how do we facilitate conversations we're talking about defining a wish list for what experimentalists would like to be able to model perspective articles tutorial meetings. And then I was just trying to capture a lot what people were saying about specific challenges relevant to negative emission sciences so like maybe starting this wish list like a little some of these are like could be things that would be on that wish list. So modeling solvent effects simulating a reaction at a constant potential. So then maybe this is the what what would the theorist or the computational people like to be able to see like what inputs are they missing from to help sort of validate their theories. Is this seem and then some possible approaches that we've talked about you know talking about using computational approaches like life cycle assessment you know modeling energy requirements so this is what I think Andrea and Kristen were talking about using these sort of bigger systems level computational approaches to help guide the choices experimentalists make when they're trying to pursue various materials or approaches ruling out those that are not going to be viable but also and also defining benchmarks to meet to to get you into the sort of negative emissions zone. And then we talked about you know having sort of ideal like a combinations of sort of model experimental systems to really zero in on specific aspects of complex systems. Am I missing anything or what else or so here's kind of my picture of what we've talked about so far. So and so one thing maybe so we kind of when we're talking about specific challenges we a lot of it was like well here's what experimentalists would like to model. So is there anything else that from from the theoretical people who like gosh if we had if if the experimentalists could only give us this piece of data you know that would really help. ",
