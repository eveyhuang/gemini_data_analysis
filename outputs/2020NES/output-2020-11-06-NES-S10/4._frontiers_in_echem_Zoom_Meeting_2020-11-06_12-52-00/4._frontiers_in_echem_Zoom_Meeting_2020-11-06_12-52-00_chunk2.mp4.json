I mean, uh but anyway, it's a 70-year-old company, right? Uh so and it's it's very Scandinavian, right? Very Danish. Uh so uh so I wonder if if if it's if, you know, whatever, right? I mean, a modernized version of uh of uh select of of Halder Topso could just like bootstrap this field, right?",

I mean, there's no there's no great, I mean, I think uh the the the, you know, the long-term view doesn't exist, right? Which is why you need someone to raise obscene amounts of capital so that you don't have you don't need a long-term view, right? There's only there's only one of two ways you can do it, right? Like you you don't need to take a long-term view because someone will bankroll uh if if you know, if if you know, if investors don't come, you know, someone can say, I'll just put my own money in, right? So I think that I think that big difference uh is what drives the sort of short versus long term. And Topso being a private company has been able to do that, right? Uh you know, Halder uh I guess the family still owns a significant portion which allows them to make these kinds of decisions compared to the yeah, compared to those that have to answer to Wall Street.",
