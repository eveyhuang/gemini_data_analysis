How do we selectively get methane to something useful like methanol?",

      "transcript": "Oh, absolutely. Yes. So if you could, so, so a real advantage to electrochemicals is that by going at low temperature, you don't get the thermodynamic products. Absolutely. Um, but it's, uh, I mean, part of it is, is obviously the, the fully oxidized thermodynamic product. The other problem is that as you start oxidizing it, the CH bonds get weaker and weaker and become easier to activate even under ambient conditions. So if you have something that's active enough to activate methane, it, it's easier to activate the products in almost all cases. I'm not saying it's not doable. I, you know, I love challenging problems, but I think",
