Um, you know, not so many years ago, you'll never be gasoline. That was always the Well, it turns out that we're almost on the cusp of doing that. Um, and the uh, issues now becoming, you know, getting over the cusp is not a matter of inventing anymore. Uh, there's a problem that's happening inside that those those devices that is not letting us necessarily, you know, zip that cusp. So, is that really not the case for um, these reactions of transformation of greenhouse gases into something that then you can use to get it out of the atmosphere? Is it just a matter of incentives? There's really um",

So, so we we talked about this in in the last subgroup is that, you know, at at NREL we've done technoeconomic and life cycle assessments of different pathways for, you know, full air to barrel scenarios. And as you scale up CO2 electrolysis, whether you use uh something like Opus 12, which is a PEM electrolysis in in acid or something like dioxide, which is alkaline. Um as you scale this up to, you know, more than 10 to 50,000 units of production, the major cost in both of those systems is the membranes. So the idea of, you know, the power's cost is not uh it's it's nothing, even the bipolar plates are a small thing, separations aren't too bad if we can do this well. But for both of them, the real limiting step is the cost of membranes and both the the base materials but then also the manufacturing at large scale. So I think that's where we can kind of, you know, look at which, you know, how did batteries get 10x cheaper in 10 years? Was it the cathodes that got cheaper? Was it the better electrolyte? I think we can learn, you know, like people have said from these other fields, how did they improve efficiency, reduce costs, usually to material components or stability or durability and and for electrolyzers, we I mean, all the modeling points in any case, whether we do this in alkaline conditions, the membranes are going to be the driver for for the cost.",

So the assumption is that even if it's scale, you know, an alkaline membrane scales the same way as a Nafion, which it may or may not, even if it does, it's still the major cost driver.",

I think that's that's sort of getting to Kelsey's point, right? If if it's already um it's already very low, it's very I mean the ceiling uh the the the floor for this is probably like a dollar per meter square, right?

This is going to come out much worse than I mean it, but um in all these models, there's the assumption that technology and performance stays constant in a sense, right? It's a pure scale, you know, you get economies of scale and that will to a to a degree was a big player in the battery cost lowering because the chemistry hasn't really changed much. Um but that, you know, assumes that you cannot do better performance, right? There's probably a metric of dollar per unit of something. That unit of something is related to your ability to do the reaction. Um and that assumes that you cannot do the reaction faster or um, you know, using less energy or uh more selectively so that you don't have to separate. And so that then takes you back to the way you're doing the reaction. And are we convinced that we cannot do better? Because I don't know that anybody I mean, you know, Wilson, you'll tell me, are are is are these technologies that you evaluate based on cascade reactions like Jenny was proposing?",

Now for technoeconomic assessment, um we actually do a sensitivity analysis to see which operational or material parameters would lead to the biggest shift in cost. And there we see that the biggest drivers are the single pass conversion efficiency and the current density. Now the issue with that is that if you look in literature, those are things where it's kind of like whackable. If somebody can do very good current current density, they have very low single pass conversion. If they have very good single pass, they have low current. So in the end, you ideally would like them both and then that is to us a frontier is that how can you do both of those things at the same time? And that takes I don't think that that's going to be solved by a cascade reaction. I think that's going to be reactor engineering and process integration that's going to solve that not not a cascade on the catalyst. Can I try and translate that, you know, to, you know, as a chemist into activity versus selectivity? Is that what you mean?",

And the reason I ask the question is in that context would any kind of a cascade architecture have any logic to it?",

The the limit under any conditions is about 60% because then at some conversion uh of of flow rates and current density the CO2 is consumed by the electrolyte and the hydroxides. So 60% is the best you can get. Matt Cannon had a nice paper on this recently. But the way to get around that is just to do CO electrolysis because CO2 to CO is industrial. You can buy from Halder Topso a skid that's, you know, the size of your basement and use CO2 to CO very well. If you do direct CO reduction, there's no CO hydroxide equilibrium. So then that the consumption by the electrolyte goes to zero. So that that that CO2 consumption is a huge problem.",
