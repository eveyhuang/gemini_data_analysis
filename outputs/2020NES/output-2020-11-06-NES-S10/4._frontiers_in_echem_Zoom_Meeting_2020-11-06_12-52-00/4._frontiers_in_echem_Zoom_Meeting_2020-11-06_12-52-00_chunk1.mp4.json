That was always the well, it turns out that we're almost on the cusp of doing that. And the issue is now becoming, you know, getting over the cusp is not a matter of incentives anymore. There's a problem that's happening inside that those those devices that is not letting us necessarily, you know, zip that cusp. So, is that really not the case for these reactions of transformation of greenhouse gases into something that then you can use to get it out of the atmosphere? Is it just a matter of incentives? There's really",

      "transcript": "So we we talked about this in the last subgroup is that, you know, at NREL we've done techno-economic and life cycle assessments of different pathways for, you know, full air to barrel scenarios. And as you scale up CO2 electrolysis, whether you use something like Opus 12, which is a PEM electrolysis in acid or something like Dioxide, which is alkaline. As you scale this up to, you know, more than 10 to 50,000 units of production, the major cost in both of those systems is the membranes. So the idea that catalyst cost is not it's it's nothing. Even the bipolar plates are a small thing, separations aren't too bad if we can do this well. But for both of them, the real limiting step is the cost of membranes and both the base materials, but then also the manufacturing at large scale. So I think that's where we can kind of, you know, look at which, you know, how did batteries get 10x cheaper in 10 years? Was it the cathodes that got cheaper? Was it a better electrolyte? I think we can learn, you know, like people have said from these other fields, how did they improve efficiency, reduce costs? Usually it's a material component or stability or durability. And for electrolyzers, we I mean, all the modeling points in any case, whether we do this in acidic or alkaline conditions, the membranes are going to be the driver for for the cost.",

This is just a partial annotation of the video.  If you would like me to continue annotating, please provide the next segment of the video.  Also, note that some of the behavioral annotations like smiles and nods are difficult to assess with certainty from the video, so they may have a degree of error.  If you have access to higher quality video or other data sources, the accuracy of these annotations could be improved.
