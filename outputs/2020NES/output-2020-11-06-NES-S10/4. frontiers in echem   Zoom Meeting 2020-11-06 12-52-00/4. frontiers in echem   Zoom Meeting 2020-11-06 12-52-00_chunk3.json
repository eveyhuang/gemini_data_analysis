The other problem is that as you start oxidizing it, the CH bonds get weaker and weaker and become easier to activate even under ambient conditions. Because if you have something that's active enough to activate methane, it's easier to activate the products in almost all cases. I'm not saying it's not doable.

Because there are no, this, this sort of, I guess Narby gap, right? There's great conductors for protons at like low temperature and high temperature, but nothing in this sort of middle.
