      "transcript": "Say your name and affiliation and a very short description, perhaps a one-liner. Oh, C3PO, we have everybody. Okay, so we'll go around the room and name and affiliation and a very short, like high-level description of research interests. In the previous breakout, uh, you know, at least I had the idea of, you know, sharing the title of your last submitted proposal, which I found was cute. Um, if you want to do that, then, you know, go ahead. But, um, yeah, but keep it, you know, brief so that we can get going. Um, I'm going to start. Uh, my name is Jordi Cabana, and I'm in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois, Chicago. I am trained as a solid-state chemist who went into electrochemistry through batteries and realized that transition metal compounds do electrochemical reactions that are interesting beyond batteries. And now, I have a smaller effort on photocatalysis as well. And that's one of the reasons why I'm here. Um, I am going to call names, and I'm going to call you based on how I see you in my screen. Have you all in this mosaic? So, if you see, I'll say your name, and you go ahead and introduce yourselves. Uh, Sen.",
