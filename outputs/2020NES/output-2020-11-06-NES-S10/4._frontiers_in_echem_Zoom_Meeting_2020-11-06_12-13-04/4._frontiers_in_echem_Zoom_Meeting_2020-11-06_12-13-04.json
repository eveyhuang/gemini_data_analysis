Okay, so we'll go around the room uh and uh name and affiliation and a very short like high level description of research interests. Uh in the previous breakout, uh you know, Alisa had the idea of you know, sharing the title of your last submitted proposal which I thought was cute. Um if you want to do that, then you know, go ahead. Uh but um yeah, but keep it, you know, brief so that we can get going.",
