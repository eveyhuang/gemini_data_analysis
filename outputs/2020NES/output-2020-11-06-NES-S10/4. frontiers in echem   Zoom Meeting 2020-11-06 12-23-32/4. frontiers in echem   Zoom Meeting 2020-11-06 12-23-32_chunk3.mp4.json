It seems like you're saying that's not enough. Um, you have ideas on how to foster them further, how to foster that further, that communication?",

            "transcript": "I I don't necessarily know if there are the the, we have a lot of meetings, but I don't know if there's really a good meeting that, like if you think about the North American Catalysis Society meeting, which is the biggest meeting in the heterogeneous world, like electrocatalysis is hardly welcome there. Uh, and then, you know, ECS, um, uh, you know, I think generally doesn't have too much heterogeneous catalysis. So, so I think there's not, it's not clear that there there's an easy bridge, uh, to be to be formed. And I think, you know, I guess, you know, in in terms of communities, I think it's it's not, they see it as competing, right? I mean, I think, uh, it's it's a little like batteries versus fuel cells, right? I think, uh, I think it, you know, it's, which is why I guess, you know, the DOE merit review now, they they the two are now no longer together, right? So, it's I think it's it's not obvious that there is actually any serious venue that brings a bridge between those two communities.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, but like so like with the AICHE maybe that, but that that's not often research, I've never found ACHE to be research focused, um, completely. Um, but I do I do think that I don't, it's kind of like, uh, fuel cells and, uh, batteries shouldn't be competing. They have, they're different applications, right? Um, and so that should that's us, you know, hopefully a misnomer. But, um, I I do think the thermo catalysis community, there's a, you know, advent of like dynamic catalysis and people are applying biases and people are looking at how, um, Exxon Mobile and all these industries are want to electrify these processes in some sort. So, I don't know. I I think that that that may just be time and adoption. But I do think, I do think thermo catalysis people are coming around to electrification street, uh, but that's just a recent discussion point that I've had with a few.",

Let's take it in a in a different direction, you know, what else is stopping us from, you know, manipulating things at the levels that you would like to manipulate them. What's stopping us from doing the cascade reaction the way that, you know, a cell would, uh, a biological cell would do. Uh, that's what cells do, right? They do cascade reactions all the time or, you know, manipulating that those local, uh, reactions that are happening, you know, you want to see happening side by side, right?

I mean, you think about people studying things like CO reduction or other downstream products, there just haven't been as much of that. And so I think it's just, I don't know if it's, I don't know where that is, but, you know, you think about since we've had so much trouble getting selective productivity for more complex products, that would be sort of the next step is, can we take some of the things that we can make cleanly and use those as feedstock for additional reduction reactions.",
