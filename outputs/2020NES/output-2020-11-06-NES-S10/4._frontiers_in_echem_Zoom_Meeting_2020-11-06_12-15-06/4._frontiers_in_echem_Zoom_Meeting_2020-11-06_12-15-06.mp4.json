So, the topic that you're here for, you signed up for is frontiers of electrochemistry, which is a topic that is very dear to my heart because as some of you have noticed, I've changed my background. I run a program in the summer for one week that is student-centric, and it's precisely on the frontiers of electrochemistry. So I was very happy to see this topic come up, and that's why I signed up for it. So I figured, you know, in the spirit of the topic, I would change my background to make it even more, you know, frontiery. The mechanics that has worked pretty well, in my opinion, is for me to give you one or two minutes to think about a key idea that you think has to do with frontiers of electrochemistry. I would refer you to the PowerPoint, and Adam, you can use that to start filling in ideas. You see that all names are already there, including mine.

There seems to be an opportunity gap with other molecules that are much less talked about. Methane is one that seems to be bubbling up, no pun intended, in this program. So I wonder if there's an opportunity there that could fill and maybe even use to seek funding from these agencies. Think electrochemistry broadly to do this as a tool to get gases out of the way and turn them into perhaps something useful. And I think that, you know, Jenny brought up the issue of whether CO2 to fuels is really negative emissions. I don't think you should get very bogged down by that. You should just discuss the electrochemistry question more than the application question, but you could also spin it around and say, you know, can you take it a step further and instead of turning it into CO2 to fuels, can you think about CO2 or methane to plastics, which is a much more permanent way of getting the CO2 out instead of creating a new cycle. So, I don't even know if that's possible, but just to get out of that little trap that you may fall in, because we really want to talk about electrochemistry itself.",
