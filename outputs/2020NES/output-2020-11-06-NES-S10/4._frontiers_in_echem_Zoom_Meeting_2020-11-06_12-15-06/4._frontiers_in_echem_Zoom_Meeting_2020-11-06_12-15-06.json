Um so the topic that you are here for you signed up for is frontiers of electrochemistry which is a topic that I was very happy to see this because some of you have noticed I've changed my background. I run a program in the summer uh for one week that is student centric and it's precisely on the frontiers of electrochemistry. So I was very happy to see this topic come up and that's why I signed up for it. Um so I figured you know in the spirit of the topic I would change my background um to make it even more, you know, front tier. Um mechanics that has worked pretty well in my opinion is uh for me to give you one or two minutes to think about um, you know, a key idea that you think has to do with frontiers of electrochemistry.",

There seems to be an opportunity gap with other molecules that are much less talked about. Methane is one that seems to be uh bubbling up and no pun intended um in this uh in this program. So I wonder if there's a an opportunity there that we could feel uh and maybe even used to seek funding from these from these uh from these programs. Uh so think electrochemistry broadly to to give us um, you know, as a tool to get carbon out of the way and turn them into perhaps something useful.",

I don't think you should get very bogged down by that. You should just discuss the the electrochemistry question more than the application question. But you could also spin it around and say, you know, can you take it a step further and step instead of turning it into CO2 to fuels, can you think about CO2 or methane to plastics, which is a much more permanent um way of uh you know getting the CO2 out instead of creating a new cycle. So you know I don't even know if that's possible, but just to get out of that little trap that you may fall in. So you really want to talk about electrochemistry itself.",
