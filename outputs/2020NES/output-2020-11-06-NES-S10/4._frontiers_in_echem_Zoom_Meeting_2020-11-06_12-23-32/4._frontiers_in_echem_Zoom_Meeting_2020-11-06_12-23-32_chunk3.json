Uh, and then, you know, ECS, um, uh, you know, I think generally doesn't have too much heterogeneous catalysis. So, so I think there's not it's not clear that there there's a easy bridge uh to be to be formed and I think, you know, I guess, you know, in in terms of communities, I think it's it's not the they see it as competing, right? I mean, I think uh it's it's a little like batteries versus fuel cells, right? I think uh I think it's uh you know, it's uh which is why I guess you know, the DOE merit review now they they the two are now no longer together. So it's I think it's it's not obvious that there is actually any serious venue that brings a bridge between those two communities.",

Um, but I do I do think that I don't it's kind of like uh fuel cells and uh batteries shouldn't be competing. They have they're different applications, right? Um, and so that should that's a, you know, hopefully a misnomer. But um, I I do think the thermocatalysis community there's a, you know, advent of like dynamic catalysis and people are applying biases and people are looking at how um Exon Mobile and all these industries are want to electrify these processes in some sort. So I don't know. I I think that that that may just be time and adoption. But I do think I do think thermocatalysis people are coming around to electrochemistry.

What's stopping us from doing the cascade reaction the way that you know, a cell would uh a biological cell would do. That's what cells do, right? They do cascade reactions all the time. Or you know, manipulating that those local uh reactions that are happening you know, you want to see happening side by side, right? That local galvanic cell. Why aren't we doing that now? We just don't care enough?",

Uh, so I think it it requires, you know, those kinds of instigators that uh would be able to raise obscene levels of capital, right? I mean you you need you know, billion dollars worth of uh, you know, money in some form, right? whether it's directly to R&D or or whatever, but like to to get a a thriving sort of initial ecosystem around which you can move forward.

I think uh, you know, uh this is like saying that um, I mean the advantage that, you know, some of the other industries have is you can sort of sell something intermediate uh and make money and then slowly, you know, move. Maybe this is possible here also, but uh the the in order to compete, right? you you you need a a massive reactor, which is uh which is when you can compete with uh other ways of making uh chemicals or fuels. Uh, so I think that that scale is maybe one one challenge that there maybe there are not easy intermediate products that could get us to to that scale. Um, but I don't see a fundamental reason, right? I mean, I think there's no there's actually no real reason that you couldn't imagine that um that you know, we couldn't have uh, you know, another uh sort of giant instigator that takes over this field and says, okay, we're we're going to go all in on this, right?

There are already existing processes that are large scale that have a very cheap feed stock and relatively efficiently and stably can make something. So it's not that we can't make it's not that we're trying to make some product that's never been made before.
