Um, my work is primarily about electrochemical uh understanding the electro extra interfaces using uh synchrotron X-ray uh techniques. My last proposal funded was a battery proposal that we are using um we are developing batteries that that can be used under extreme environments such as nuclear radiation environments. So we are we are measuring battery performance under nuclear radiation environment with the hope that we can design batteries for uh nuclear industry and also for outer space exploration, uh interstellar travel inventory. Um, the proposal that I really wanted to get funded, not funded yet, um I'm revising it. Uh it's a proposal about um understanding the electro electron interface in the uh concentration concentration gradient layers, how to utilize the concentration gradient layer to manipulate the the chemical reactions so as a nano reactor at the interface.",
