            "transcript": "you just bound the CO2 instead of regenerating CO2 by putting heat in to high temperature release the gas at 120 140 degree C. What if we are doing electrochemical reaction of the bound CO2? Maybe temperature doesn't need to be increased. So for example you can capture CO2 from I don't know a cement plant or directly from air and then put into electrochemical reactor which is usually operates below 100 degree C for sure because you don't want to boil off all your electrolyte. More likely you know low temperature room temperature kind of application. And then you make products which feeds to the biological system. So now you're asking in a sense a right question right? Because but you have to go even deeper. My process does it has to be changed to tag to another technology before and after right? Does the same regeneration technology make sense or not right? That's where really hybrid collaboration can happen among you guys right? You're asking the right question.",

I was recently my lab was growing some bacteria working pH2. Good thing about that is you have a lot of you don't have much contamination at pH2 and you can add a lot of salt there so the solution get much more conductive in terms of electrochemistry. And there are also alkaline files because I was talking to yesterday I met him in gather and he asked me he challenged me can I put a bacteria inside an alkaline electrolyzer? And and actually if you go to literature you can surprisingly. Not too high not not pH 14 but pH 10 or 11 no problem at all. You can get you can have bacteria in pH 11 at three mole five mole sodium chloride. And you if you look at that you realize nature has a way to evolve and there are multi-pronged approach how biology handle things. It it really depends and sometimes I as a as a materials people chemist by training I feel like it's a treasure grove. You just look at literature you feel what what do you want? Do you want acid bacteria? Okay there are one. You want alkaline bacteria? There are one. But you need to find it out and find a way to use those.",

            "transcript": "One of the things that I'd like to add is that when you for example if you have an absorptive reactor you want to do capture conversion right to get there you can do do it isothermally right? In other words you can react your you can capture your CO2 at whatever temperature you want to do your reaction right? And instead of regenerating your material you can just add your reactant right the other reactant let's say CO2 hydrogenation right and do isothermally instead of you know changing your bed temperature. So I think you can do it isothermally. Yes pressure of course this is also a challenge but I think considering the temperature it is possible that to do it isothermally so that you can reduce the amount of energy input.",

So maybe the optimal process for doing CO2 utilization may be if you're combining biological systems may be a constant temperature maybe pressure or vacuum swing process right? So Alissa and Roger do you think we should go over the points that we'll be discussing as part of the report because we're about six minutes away from",

But in terms of hybrid approaches I guess when thinking about ways of sort of coupling you know electrochemical and biological and thermal and so on I also think of hybrid as potentially a way of actually making better use of a resource that we are using to do separation or conversion. So if you for example you think about the solar resource you have let's say you're trying to do something photochemically and you have some solar cell for example it's going to harness a certain fraction of the spectrum and then you're going to get a bunch of a part of the spectrum that's you know wasted so let's say that's like thermal energy. If you engineered a system where you're sort of taking that thermal energy somewhere else to to do like a thermal you know like a thermal separation in addition to the photoelectrochemical separation you're doing then that's that's a hybrid approach that uses more of the solar resource to to accomplish separation or conversion. So you know it involves sort of thinking about a reactor that has flow involved so you're taking away the thermal energy and then you could do like I mean it doesn't have to be like thermoelectric but it could be it could be thermal in addition to photoelectrochemical. So that's that's another paradigm for thinking about hybrid approaches.",

It's a it's a diverse portfolio of negative emission science and you can better use the solar energy source like you can using couple with thermal thermal chemical with other negative emission science so better use the solar energy.",

            "transcript": "So I think one of the things we can add which we didn't call it out although we discussed it is the systems integration and optimization in multi-scale both in terms of time and physical scale. That's very important when you put different types of reactors together with the grid which is fluctuating. Right? So you have fluctuating intermittent amount of electricity might be coming to your reactor right? And your electrochemical reactor and biological reactor has different rate of reactions and different size. Let's say you have a tiny reactor connected to huge reactor just because that's how volumetric flow rate is. Can we manage that? I mean there's a lot more questions than just a plug and play right? So how to provide energy what kind of energy and that's all about systems integration and optimization with both time scale and physical scale and those are very important. And in fact those solicitations were out there so people are getting funding in this area not in the hybrid technology. There was a proposal solicitation on connecting CO2 capture to storage. No electricity grid market to the CCS I remember. Or these are very interesting and I think going back to Fateme's earlier comments on modular reactor design maybe that's another consideration we should have.",
