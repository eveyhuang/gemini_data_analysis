            "transcript": "carbon mineralization as well. And then interesting thing kind of bring it up about hybrid, how to view hybrid technology, you know, right? At the end of the day, carbon will change to different forms, you're putting energy in some form, right? Hybrid means you're turning one form of energy to another one and feeding it to another unit. That's how you can view it. So for example, technology, if you want to get magnesium from for example, magnesium silicon materials, if you need a lot of acid and base. If you can electrochemically make acid and base, there's so many decarbonization you can do. People don't think about it, right? So there are a lot of technologies out there already existing. Just doing bipolar membrane with the electrolysis, you can make huge amount of acid and base and it doesn't seem like it does do anything to carbon decarbonization or negative carbon technology, but like is doing in a sense that by putting them together, you're moving energy such a way that you can make it net benefit. I think that's what hybrid means in my opinion.",

            "transcript": "That's absolutely what I think the key question is. And can you create, you almost need two very different reaction environments on different sides of a cell, right? So you basically want to be able to break down rocks. Rocks are cheap and abundant and then you want to be able to create rocks and then the thermodynamics has to work out. And then and the CO2 mass balance has to work out, which is the challenge. But what I find really exciting are these processes, you know, natural processes do this actually fairly well. They just do it very slowly and are very site specific and we have many logistical challenges and so on. So I I find the idea of distributed mineralization very compelling that where we can decouple it from geologic formations, but then um yeah, that's the key question.",

So you you change it, um switch it to a synthetic process and then you can do the processes integrated directly into the plant or nearby without needing to transport CO2 and pump it underground.",

So we just don't study the I I don't know much about electrochemistry side of things.",
