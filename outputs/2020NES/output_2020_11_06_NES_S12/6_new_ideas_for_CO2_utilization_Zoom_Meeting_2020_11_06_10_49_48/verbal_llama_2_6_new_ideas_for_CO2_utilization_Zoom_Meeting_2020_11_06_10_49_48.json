At the end of the day, carbon will change to different forms. You're putting energy in some form, right? Hybrid means you're turning one form of energy to another one and feeding it to another unit. That's how you can view it. So for example, Betar's technology, if you want to get magnesium from for example magnesium silicon materials, if you need a lot of acid and base. If you can electrochemically make acid and base, there's so many decarbonization you can do. People don't think about it, right? So there are a lot of technologies out there already existing. Just doing bipolar membrane with the electrolysis, you can make huge amount of acid and base and it doesn't seem like it does do anything to carbon decarbonization or negative carbon technology, but like Betar is doing, in a sense that by putting them together, you're moving energy such a way that you can make it net benefit. I think that's what hybrid means in my opinion. Go ahead. ",

But what I find really exciting are these processes, you know, natural processes do this actually fairly well, they just do it very slowly and are very site specific and we have many logistical challenges and so on.

So have you seen studies that address this question or do we is there a way or a framework even to discriminate between processes that are truly carbon negative versus those that would necessarily be carbon positive, right? And for folks that are working in the area like Chong clearly, is there I mean in terms of the fundamental science clearly there's a lot that is interesting that's going on.

So you know when Google runs their their server farms, they buy renewable energy to do it. So the idea that you can run these electrochemical processes today on 100% renewable electricity is entirely reasonable. So the idea that you run your calculation as if it was grid electricity is I think just wrong. So that simplifies it a lot. You can assume that your electricity is carbon free and go ahead and do your chemistry. ",

        "utterance": "Alissa Park: So there was an earlier session had that report out just briefly about carbon negative technology, what does that mean? So you need to see you to the chemicals and fuels, usually the best you can do is carbon neutral. Because when you say carbon negative means that whatever carbon was in the atmosphere, which is a fossil based because we emitted more than we had to, we should have, and then went back into the earth so that there was a net negative direction. That's what negative technology means. If we keep circulating using that carbon above the ground, that's zero, right? So carbon neutral. So the reason a lot of times somehow CO2 utilization got lopsided with the conversion, negativity and all that so that we put it together, but I think it serves a very different role because at the end of the day, like this is not only about long bridge of CCUS, like from now on in the future if you care about climate change and the earth, you should stop using fossil carbon. So I don't even call it decarbonization of materials, it should be defossilization of materials because we can't without carbon you can't make anything. As long as that carbon came from air or somewhere, it'd be fine. So where should we get that carbon, that's the question, right? We are talking about that in a sense indirectly because there's one in air, one in ocean you talked about, and then also in rocks. So let's not touch the one in the rock because it already got stored and it doesn't move around, great, let's not touch that. Means that you have ocean or air only. That's why there's a lot of research on direct air capture and ocean capture, right? So that as long as you get those which is non-fossil carbon, you defossilize your chemical industry which should be forever and ever because we're never going to go back after lowering the CO2 concentration, taking out more fossil out of the ground millions of years from now, right? Hopefully not. So I think this is kind of new way of looking at the material cycle above the ground. So calculation of carbon negativity is kind of very tough on this case because you'll be best at best neutral. ",

I was recently my lab was growing some bacteria working pH2. Good thing about that is you have a lot of you don't have much contamination at pH2 and you can add a lot of salt there so the solution get much more conductive in terms of electrochemistry. And there are also alkaline files because I was talking to yesterday I met him in gather and he asked me he challenged me can I put a bacteria inside an alkaline electrolyzer? And and actually if you go to literature you can surprisingly. Not too high not not pH 14 but pH 10 or 11 no problem at all. You can get you can have bacteria in pH 11 at three mole five mole sodium chloride. And you if you look at that you realize nature has a way to evolve and there are multi-pronged approach how biology handle things. It it really depends and sometimes I as a as a materials people chemist by training I feel like it's a treasure grove. You just look at literature you feel what what do you want? Do you want acid bacteria? Okay there are one. You want alkaline bacteria? There are one. But you need to find it out and find a way to use those. ",

In other words you can react your you can capture your CO2 at whatever temperature you want to do your reaction right? And instead of regenerating your material you can just add your reactant right the other reactant let's say CO2 hydrogenation right and do isothermally instead of you know changing your bed temperature. So I think you can do it isothermally. Yes pressure of course this is also a challenge but I think considering the temperature it is possible that to do it isothermally so that you can reduce the amount of energy input. ",

But in terms of hybrid approaches I guess when thinking about ways of sort of coupling you know electrochemical and biological and thermal and so on I also think of hybrid as potentially a way of actually making better use of a resource that we are using to do separation or conversion. So if you for example you think about the solar resource you have let's say you're trying to do something photochemically and you have some solar cell for example it's going to harness a certain fraction of the spectrum and then you're going to get a bunch of a part of the spectrum that's you know wasted so let's say that's like thermal energy. If you engineered a system where you're sort of taking that thermal energy somewhere else to to do like a thermal you know like a thermal separation in addition to the photoelectrochemical separation you're doing then that's that's a hybrid approach that uses more of the solar resource to to accomplish separation or conversion. So you know it involves sort of thinking about a reactor that has flow involved so you're taking away the thermal energy and then you could do like I mean it doesn't have to be like thermoelectric but it could be it could be thermal in addition to photoelectrochemical. So that's that's another paradigm for thinking about hybrid approaches. ",

That's very important when you put different types of reactors together with the grid which is fluctuating. Right? So you have fluctuating intermittent amount of electricity might be coming to your reactor right? And your electrochemical reactor and biological reactor has different rate of reactions and different size. Let's say you have a tiny reactor connected to huge reactor just because that's how volumetric flow rate is. Can we manage that? I mean there's a lot more questions than just a plug and play right? So how to provide energy what kind of energy and that's all about systems integration and optimization with both time scale and physical scale and those are very important. And in fact those solicitations were out there so people are getting funding in this area not in the hybrid technology. There was a proposal solicitation on connecting CO2 capture to storage. No electricity grid market to the CCS I remember.
