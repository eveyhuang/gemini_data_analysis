At the end of the day, carbon will change to different forms, you're putting energy in some form, right? Hybrid means you're turning one form of energy to another one and feeding it to another unit. That's how you can view it. So for example, technology, if you want to get magnesium from for example, magnesium silicon materials, if you need a lot of acid and base. If you can electrochemically make acid and base, there's so many decarbonization you can do. People don't think about it, right? So there are a lot of technologies out there already existing. Just doing bipolar membrane with the electrolysis, you can make huge amount of acid and base and it doesn't seem like it does do anything to carbon decarbonization or negative carbon technology, but like is doing in a sense that by putting them together, you're moving energy such a way that you can make it net benefit.

I was recently, my lab was growing some bacteria working pH2. Um good thing about that is you have a lot you don't have much contamination at pH2 and you can add a lot of salt there, so the solution get much more conductive in terms of electrochemistry. And there are also alkaline files because I was talking to Joe yesterday. I met him in Gator and he asked me, can I put the bacteria inside the alkaline electrolyzer? And actually, if you go to literature, you can surprisingly. Um not too high. Not not pH14 but pH10, 11, no problem at all. You can get you can have bacteria in pH11 at three mole, five mole sodium chloride. Um and if you look at that, you realize um I mean, nature has a way to evolve and their multi-prongs approach how about technology handle things. It really depends and sometimes as a material people attempts by training, I feel like it's a treasure growth. Just look at it, sure you feel what do you want? You want acid bacteria?

I was trying to get it in edgewise, but but couldn't. Um but in terms of hybrid approaches, I guess we think about ways of sort of coupling, you know, electrochemical, biological, thermal, and so on. I also think of hybrid as uh potentially a way of actually making better use of an of a resource that we are using to do separation or conversion. So, for example, we think about the solar resource, you have you know, let's say you try and do something photoelectrochemically and you have some solar cell, for example. It's going to harness a certain fraction of the spectrum. Um and then you're going to get a bunch a part of the spectrum that's you know, wasted. So let's say that's like thermal energy. If you engineer the system where you're sort of taking that thermal energy somewhere else to uh to do like a thermal you know, like a thermal separation in addition to the photoelectrochemical separation you're doing, then that's that's a hybrid approach that uses more of the solar resource to to accomplish separation or conversion. So, you know, it involves thinking about a reactor that has flow involved, so you're taking away the thermal energy. Um and then you could do like I mean, it doesn't have to be like thermoelectric, but it could be it could be thermal in addition to photoelectrochemical. So that's um another paradigm for thinking about hybrid approaches is. So so I added in the last sentence, but do you think that's the case? It's a it's a diverse portfolio in native machine science and you can better use the any solar energy source like you can use a couple with thermochemical with other native machine science, so better use the solar energy.

That's very important when you put different types of reactors together with the grid, which is a fluctuating. Yeah. So you want integration and scale? It's called systems integration and optimization. Okay. At so you can say multi scale systems integration and optimization. So which means that you'll have grid producing power, right? If you're doing electrochemical, right? You need to use it as a power first. You're not going to drive that out and then burn additional fossil, right? So you'll have fluctuated like a province said, there's a fluctuating intermittent amount of electricity might be coming to your reactor, right? And you look at the chemical reactor and biological reactor has different rate of reactions and different size. Let's say you have a tiny reactor connected to huge reactor just because that's how volumetric flow rate is. Can we manage that? I mean, there's a lot more questions than just a plug and play, right? So how to provide energy? What kind of energy? And that's all about systems integration and optimization with both time scale and physical scale. And those are very important.
