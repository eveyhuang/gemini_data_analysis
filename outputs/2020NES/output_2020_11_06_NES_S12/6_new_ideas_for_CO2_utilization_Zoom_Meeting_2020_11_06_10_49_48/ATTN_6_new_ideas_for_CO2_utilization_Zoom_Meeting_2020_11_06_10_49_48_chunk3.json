      "transcript": "you just bound the CO2 instead of regenerating CO2 by putting heat in to high temperature release the gas at 120 140 degrees C. What if we are doing electrochemical reaction of the bound CO2? Maybe temperature doesn't need to be increased. So for example you can capture CO2 from I don't know a cement plant or directly from air and then put into electrochemical reactor which is usually operates below 100 degrees C for sure because you don't want to boil off all your electrolyte. More likely you know low temperature room temperature kind of application. And then you make products which feeds to the biological system. So now you're asking in a sense the right question right? Because but you have to go even deeper. My process does it has to be changed to tag to another technology before and after right? Does the same regeneration technology make sense or not right? That's where really hybrid collaboration can happen among you guys right? You're asking the right question.",

      "transcript": "I think also I mean is there a need to expand the temperature range of these can you evolve these enzymes or biological systems to operate in a larger temperature range that is more that that that is more I guess feasible for direct air capture? Is this question being asked in the literature?",

      "transcript": "Yeah and they are first of all they are thermophiles. There are there are bacteria can survive up to 70 Celsius I mean pretty high. And they are acidophiles. I was recently my lab was growing some bacteria working pH 2. Good thing about that is you have a lot of you don't have much contamination at pH 2 and you can add a lot of salt there so the solution get much more conductive in terms of electrochemistry. And there are also alkaline files because I was talking to yesterday I met him in gather and he asked me he challenged me can I put a bacteria inside an alkaline electrolyzer? And and actually if you go to literature you can surprisingly. Not too high not not pH 14 but pH 10 or 11 no problem at all. You can get you can have bacteria in pH 11 at three mole five mole sodium chloride. And if you look at that you realize nature has a way to evolve and there are multi-pronged approach how biology handle things. It really depends and sometimes as a materials people chemist by training I feel like it's a treasure grove. You just look at literature you feel what what do you want? Do you want acid bacteria? Okay there are one. You want alkaline bacteria? There are one. But you need to find it out and find a way to use those.",

      "transcript": "One of the things that I'd like to add is that when you for example if you have an absorptive reactor you want to do capture conversion right to get there you can do it isothermally right? In other words you can react your you can capture your CO2 at whatever temperature you want to do your reaction right? And instead of regenerating your material you can just add your reactant right the other reactant let's say CO2 hydrogenation right and do isothermally instead of you know changing your bed temperature. So I think yeah you can do it isothermally. Yes pressure of course this is also a challenge but I think considering the temperature it is possible that to do it isothermally so that you can reduce the amount of energy input.",

      "transcript": "I agree and and I think what I'm saying is that the the the optimal absorption or optimal capture process for an application where you're not doing CO2 utilization might be different from the optimal process for a process where you are doing CO2 utilization. So maybe the optimal process for doing CO2 utilization may be if you're combining biological systems may be a constant temperature maybe pressure or vacuum swing process right? So Alissa and Roger do you think we should go over the points that we'll be discussing as part of the report because we're about six minutes away from...",
