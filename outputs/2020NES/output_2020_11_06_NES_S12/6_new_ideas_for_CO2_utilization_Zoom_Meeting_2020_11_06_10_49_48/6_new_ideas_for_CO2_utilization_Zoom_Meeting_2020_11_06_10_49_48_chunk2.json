It's something we we think about but from my perspective at least as it relates to the issues that have come up so far in this session, I don't have a clear picture of what are the best avenues in terms of actual cost, economic impact. Or is that is that all the way known at this point in time?",

People who think it should cost a small amount of money and it's not going to. We're we're going to pay to have our climate fixed. It's not going to be thousands of dollars but it's certainly going to be hundreds of dollars per ton. And so don't let the cost be the thing that keeps you from developing these processes right now. But at the same time, don't let yourself get trapped into like this discussion of of about where you're going to get your calcium and magnesium ions. That's a big deal, they're heavy. You can't you have to think about those kinds of things but I would discourage you from thinking too much about the cost right now and more think about the overall systems. Land use is a big deal. You can come up with more money but you can't get more land. Things like that.",

And the question of not steady state chemical processes for making products but intermittent processes that are that are not only flexible towards intermittent energy inputs but also maybe take advantage of those spikes and troughs in energy input if you will. Maybe at a process level, maybe at a molecular or atomic scale, that's something that is a question I think that hasn't been asked to the best of my knowledge and I just wonder if there are following up on Roger's comment about trying to come up with creative solutions, right? Are those variable energy non-constant energy inputs, do they allow you to allow you to develop catalysts and processes and adsorbents that are atypical if you will for lack of a better term. That's something that just comes to my mind.",

Because in nature the evolution already teach organisms how to retain their integrity for an extended period of time. So so at least and we did experiments say that you just you don't need to feed the intermediate feedstock for the microorganism all the time. You just and you can do it half a day and take another half day off and they they they preserve.",

I if I if I look at a classic noble metal catalyst or a metal oxide based catalyst, I have to retain a certain chemical potential environment above the catalyst to let's say prevent it from deactivating or I have to I have to if I'm not operating my reactor for a certain period of time, I have to be careful about what environment I expose it to so that",

So what it means is that if you don't provide energy source for them for an extended period of time, they anyone you see all the living organism you see here have been tested, pressure tested already. So so the nature of that. And so in that context, if you couple with electrochemistry with microorganism, it doesn't mean you have to feed them all the time. Of course, if you stop feeding them for a year, they probably will die. But if you don't feed them for a couple of days, once you're providing energy again, they pick up and they replicate themselves, they grow. And so the amount you can if you think about microorganism as a catalyst, the amount of catalyst you have is dependent on how much energy you're providing because they're self-replicate. You don't need to control how much catalyst you have there.",

So for example, if I use a traditional non-biological catalyst, right, I would need to the catalysts are typically optimized for a certain set of reaction conditions. So let's say let's say in this particular case we're talking about a hybrid capture and conversion device, right? So let's say I'm capturing CO2 using from air using an absorption process and I put in a temperature input, energy input to desorb CO2 at close to atmospheric pressure, right? Let's say that if I have an intermittent energy input, my concentration of CO2 can vary, right? If I'm using a standard absorption process, that that may not be the case. But for an intermittent energy input, let's say that sometimes my CO2 pressure is is let's say 0.1 bar and let's say sometimes it's 2 bar.",

Is that what you're implying, I think? Okay, so that's interesting to know as well and this is all these are all new aspects that I'm learning. So you're saying that if I have a biological system that is converting CO2 downstream of my capture unit, there's a maximum temperature that my desorption can occur at, right?

And so from engineering point of view, you think about why sometimes a big fermentator has an issue, you get if you if your fermentator beer it get too big, sometimes the beer doesn't taste that good, partly because the heat is not uniform. The temperature profile is not uniform anymore and the change of the process there. So so in that is what I would say is a consideration is biological system are much more sensitive to temperature because at 35 degree they survive, 40 degree they die. But beyond that",

So that's what I say I that's why I say that first of all, I wouldn't say it's a it's a curse it's definitely it's going to doom the technology because engineers, especially fermentation industry, they they solve this out.

Because now all the direction is going there, should we do thermal regeneration of your CO2 capture material? That's a whole another question.
