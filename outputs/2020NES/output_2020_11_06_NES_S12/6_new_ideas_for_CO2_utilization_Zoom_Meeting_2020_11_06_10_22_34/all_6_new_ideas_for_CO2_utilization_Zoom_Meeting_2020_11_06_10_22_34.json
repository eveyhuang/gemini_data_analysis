So interesting thing is people who are working on electrochemical conversion, for example, they were all used to work on formic acid, producing formic acid because it's easiest. But then the problem with what Chong was saying, separation was an issue because it's highly dissolved in low concentration in the soup, right? So you have to get that out. So what they're saying, well, why don't we make CO or something else which bubbles out a little bit more. So that there's inherent separation of your product so that you don't have energy penalty in the back end. But then now, if you want to attach the biological system, you degas your gas product, gaseous product. Now this low solubility gas, you have to redissolve to feed it to the bug, which is not a good idea, in a sense, when you think about it. So now everybody's moving back to soluble intermediate, right? So that if I make formic acid, then bugs can just continue to eat it up. But when you think about it, we're going to have intermittent renewable energy making your intermediates intermittently. And then now you have a bugs producing whatever rate, can you turn on and off, on and off easily seamless this system or the pH condition which is favored in electrochemical system would be okay for bugs down in the downstream because fluid will going around the circle. So there are a lot of questions and good thing is this is really beginning of conversation and I think this is why a lot of people are going into this.",

Um so yeah, and another thing I thought about is as you said that converting CO into intermediate, another job of CO is CO is toxic. I mean, to human beings. So probably CO could be also toxic to organisms. And so and the so that actually um design engineering design challenge because you want to give them enough CO so can be further upgraded, but you still want to make sure you don't give them too much CO so you kill them. So so that is another challenge if you're using um CO as a mediator. Um hydrogen fermentator as um fermentation as Alyssa said, that's one of approach, but another approach for me, I think it's gaining favor now again because for dehydrogenase is a very well very wide spread enzyme to loop into the ATP synthesis synthesis pathways. So that is um I think um people are working on now and but it depending on the there are different ways you can design a process and there will be different challenges. I agree with that. And I appreciate you are interested about that because I was trying to find out how um which which which agency can fund our project. But thanks for letting me know about this.",

Um in a case of polymer, it's actually a really they found for their energy budget. So what they so they store the polymer inside itself just in case that later they get starved, they can reuse those. So that's a natural way they do it and but you can break out the cell later. That's why I talk about the separation challenge. You still need to break out the cell and you got a polymer out of that. Um in a case of of a nitrogen, it is more complicated depending on the strain. You think about natural symbiosis, actually bacteria secrete ammonia for plant to use. So those in that case, it's a natural it's a soluble ammonia. But in other cases, they make urea for themselves. And and and also and in that case, what we demonstrated is you don't need to separate those because it's organic fertilizer anyway. And those bacteria happen to be accumulate phosphate too. And if you think about the biggest use of ammonia, it's a fertilizer. You have phosphorus and nitrogen, it's probably the best you want get for the agriculture. So you don't need you don't want you can just spray a bug um in a field um that's how it works. Yeah. But also yeah, sorry.",

So you take um and Betar feel free to jump in, but you take CO2 and then you sort of uh electrochemically convert it to some solid uh which is which you can store or um use for some other purpose. Um another um thing I brought up in the last breakout session which is a little sort of interest of mine is thinking about whether you can capture stuff from the ocean as opposed to direct from air. Um you have a lot of carbonate in the ocean and you can think of the ocean as obviously a big carbon sink. So if there ways you can take sea water and extract it, sort of react bicarbonate um and and you know, take take it take it out of the ocean water essentially um have a way of sort of enabling um negative emissions that way as well.

Um I'm we're working on uh trying to do essentially ex situ mineralization, uh but looking at how we can uh try to do away with the energy intensive regeneration step, the thermal regeneration step and do electrochemistry directly on the uh CO2 in solution. And we've been trying to learn about the basically the science of uh how amines interact. Uh well, we know the chemistry, of course, of how amines react with CO2, but we've been looking in some more complex environments beyond just aqueous. So looking at um you can think about aqueous, non-aqueous solvent blends, uh if you're doing electrochemistry directly in the captured state, it becomes complex because you have additional salts, uh supporting electrolyte salts, they can interact with amine, carbonate, ammonium and interesting new ways. So uh you can get different kind of states um in solution and and then and then doing electrochemistry directly on that rather than on uh CO2 that's you know, dissolved in aqueous and the kind of classical approach. And what we found is um it's complicated if you try to do these reactions in aqueous. It's not impossible. It's very you know, challenging to um to uh to do the analysis actually because you have many branching um pathways depending on how you prepare your electrolytes. But we've been looking in non-aqueous systems so far and uh and see the feasibility that you can electrochemically cleave the nitrogen carbon bond directly and um take CO2 to something else. If you can make it, if you give it a very strong thermodynamic sync like to make a carbonate and alkali carbonate, uh it it works fairly well and you can um go directly, you know, CO2 all the way to a carbonate in a reactor. But then the question is you've got the price of uh making the co-reactants. So we don't get like uh calcium ions or magnesium ions for free. And so thinking about how you actually when you expand the box and uh where where do you source whatever you're mineralizing CO2 with, uh that's always a challenge. So if you can source that from somewhere uh like ocean water, you know, maybe there's some kind of concept, hybrid concept there, but but that's a challenge. Uh how do you make it really um you know, net removal of CO2 because you have to create the reactive ions. So that's something that we're we're looking very closely at right now.",
