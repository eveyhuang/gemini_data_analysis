            "transcript": "Electrochemically or thermochemically, once we have that we can feed that to biological system which can upgrade to C2 plus much bigger molecule much more selectively. So interesting thing is people who are working on electrochemical conversion, for example, they were all used to work on formic acid, producing formic acid because it's easiest. But then the problem with what Chong was saying, separation was an issue because it's highly dissolved in low concentration in the soup, right? So you have to get that out. So what they're saying, well, why don't we make CO or something else which bubbles out a little bit more. So that there's inherent separation of your product so that you don't have energy penalty in the back end. But then now, if you want to attach the biological system, you degas your gas product, gaseous product. Now this low solubility gas, you have to redissolve to feed it to the bug, which is not a good idea, in a sense, when you think about it. So now everybody's moving back to soluble intermediate, right? So that if I make formic acid, then bugs can just continue to eat it up. But when you think about it, we're going to have intermittent renewable energy making your intermediates intermittently. And then now you have a bugs producing whatever rate, can you turn on and off, on and off easily seamless this system or the pH condition which is favored in electrochemical system would be okay for bugs down in the downstream because fluid will going around the circle. So there are a lot of questions and good thing is this is really beginning of conversation and I think this is why a lot of people are going into this.",

            "transcript": "Appreciate that because when I as a grad student when I did that, um, nobody else was thinking about it. That was five years ago. Um so yeah, and another thing I thought about is as you said that converting CO into intermediate, another job of CO is CO is toxic. I mean, to human beings. So probably CO could be also toxic to organisms. And so and the so that actually um design engineering design challenge because you want to give them enough CO so can be further upgraded, but you still want to make sure you don't give them too much CO so you kill them. So so that is another challenge if you're using um CO as a mediator. Um hydrogen fermentator as um fermentation as Alyssa said, that's one of approach, but another approach for me, I think it's gaining favor now again because for dehydrogenase is a very well very wide spread enzyme to loop into the ATP synthesis synthesis pathways. So that is um I think um people are working on now and but it depending on the there are different ways you can design a process and there will be different challenges. I agree with that. And I appreciate you are interested about that because I was trying to find out how um which which which agency can fund our project. But thanks for letting me know about this.",

Um the most appropriate and easier ones, they they make a tons of their bacteria can make 99% of acetate. Bacteria can make 99% of methane. Um or maybe 99 90% of polymer um polyhexome builder rate. Um you can direct get polymer out of CO2. Um we also work on bacteria that just fix ammonia. Just fix nitrogen to ammonia. And where and and the because they are bacteria that's a natural way of doing that. And it is they are waste like is they they release these things as waste?",

            "transcript": "So so it also depends. So in a case of acetate and methane, sorry, acetate and methane, those are waste. They secrete it out. Um in a case of polymer, it's actually a really they found for their energy budget. So what they so they store the polymer inside itself just in case that later they get starved, they can reuse those. So that's a natural way they do it and but you can break out the cell later. That's why I talk about the separation challenge. You still need to break out the cell and you got a polymer out of that. Um in a case of of a nitrogen, it is more complicated depending on the strain. You think about natural symbiosis, actually bacteria secrete ammonia for plant to use. So those in that case, it's a natural it's a soluble ammonia. But in other cases, they make urea for themselves. And and and also and in that case, what we demonstrated is you don't need to separate those because it's organic fertilizer anyway. And those bacteria happen to be accumulate phosphate too. And if you think about the biggest use of ammonia, it's a fertilizer. You have phosphorus and nitrogen, it's probably the best you want get for the agriculture. So you don't need you don't want you can just spray a bug um in a field um that's how it works. Yeah. But also yeah, sorry.",

So so if you have inorganic catalyst that can do the reaction and also you have enzyme enzyme system that can also do the reaction. I guess the reaction will be, you know, if you synthesize a precursor from the inorganic catalyst part and then that fit through the through the um organism to do the to further upgrading of the reaction. Uh that's a path. The other path would be that the uh biological system do one part of the reaction and feed the precursor for the inorganic component to do the upgradation.",
