So, uh, you know, the this this formal combination of capture with turning it into a product is a hybrid that is uh I think likely to be funded soon.",

So you take um and Betar feel free to jump in, but you take CO2 and then you sort of uh electrochemically convert it to some solid uh which is which you can store or um use for some other purpose. Um another um thing I brought up in the last breakout session which is a little sort of interest of mine is thinking about whether you can capture stuff from the ocean as opposed to direct from air. Um you have a lot of carbonate in the ocean and you can think of the ocean as obviously a big carbon sink. So if there ways you can take sea water and extract it, sort of react bicarbonate um and and you know, take take it take it out of the ocean water essentially um have a way of sort of enabling um negative emissions that way as well.

Um I'm we're working on uh trying to do essentially ex situ mineralization, uh but looking at how we can uh try to do away with the energy intensive regeneration step, the thermal regeneration step and do electrochemistry directly on the uh CO2 in solution. And we've been trying to learn about the basically the science of uh how amines interact. Uh well, we know the chemistry, of course, of how amines react with CO2, but we've been looking in some more complex environments beyond just aqueous. So looking at um you can think about aqueous, non-aqueous solvent blends, uh if you're doing electrochemistry directly in the captured state, it becomes complex because you have additional salts, uh supporting electrolyte salts, they can interact with amine, carbonate, ammonium and interesting new ways. So uh you can get different kind of states um in solution and and then and then doing electrochemistry directly on that rather than on uh CO2 that's you know, dissolved in aqueous and the kind of classical approach. And what we found is um it's complicated if you try to do these reactions in aqueous. It's not impossible. It's very you know, challenging to um to uh to do the analysis actually because you have many branching um pathways depending on how you prepare your electrolytes. But we've been looking in non-aqueous systems so far and uh and see the feasibility that you can electrochemically cleave the nitrogen carbon bond directly and um take CO2 to something else. If you can make it, if you give it a very strong thermodynamic sync like to make a carbonate and alkali carbonate, uh it it works fairly well and you can um go directly, you know, CO2 all the way to a carbonate in a reactor. But then the question is you've got the price of uh making the co-reactants. So we don't get like uh calcium ions or magnesium ions for free. And so thinking about how you actually when you expand the box and uh where where do you source whatever you're mineralizing CO2 with, uh that's always a challenge. So if you can source that from somewhere uh like ocean water, you know, maybe there's some kind of concept, hybrid concept there, but but that's a challenge. Uh how do you make it really um you know, net removal of CO2 because you have to create the reactive ions. So that's something that we're we're looking very closely at right now.",
