      "transcript": "electrochemically or thermochemically. Once we have that, we can feed that to biological system which can upgrade to C2 plus much bigger molecule much more selectively. So interesting thing is people who are working on electrochemical conversion for example, they were all used to work on formic acid, producing formic acid because it's easiest. But then the problem with what Chong was saying, separation was an issue because it's highly dissolved in low concentration in the soup, right? So you have to get that out. So what you're saying, well why don't we make CO or something else which bubbles out a little bit more so that there's inherent separation of your product so that you don't have energy penalty in the back end. But then now if you want to attach the biological system, you degas your gas product gaseous product, now this low solubility gas you have to redissolve to feed it to the bug which is not a good idea in a sense when you think about it. So now everybody's moving back to soluble intermediate, right? So that if I make formic acid and bugs can just continue to eat it up. But when you think about it, we're going to have intermittent renewable energy making your intermediates intermittently and then now you have a bugs producing whatever rate, can you turn on off on and off easily seamless this system or the pH condition which is favored in electrochemical system would be okay for bugs down in the downstream because fluid will go in around the circle. So there are a lot of questions and the thing is this is really beginning of conversation and I think that's why a lot of people are going into this.",

      "transcript": "I appreciate that because when I as a grad student when I did that nobody else was thinking about it but that was five years ago. So yeah and another thing I thought about is as you said that converting the CO in the intermediate another drawback of CO is CO is toxic I mean to human being so probably CO is could be also toxic to organisms and so that is an actual design engineering design challenge because you want to give them enough CO so it can be further upgraded but you still want to make sure you don't give them too much CO so it kill them. So that is another challenge if you're using CO as an intermediate. Hydrogen fermentator as fermentation as Alissa said that's one of the approach but another approach I think is gaining favor now again because the formate dehydrogenase is a very well widespread enzyme to loop into the ATP synthesis pathways. So that is I think people are working on now and but depending on there are different ways you can design the process and there will be different challenges. I agree with that and I appreciate ERE are interested about that because I was trying to find which agency can fund our project but thanks for letting me know about this.",
