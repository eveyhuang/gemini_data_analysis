The argument is maybe enzymes still has its uniqueness in making complicated molecules direct from air and they did that for many years. So what we try but what you need is providing a more efficient renewable energy sources like solar panel. So how can you convert dump electron from a solid material into microorganism they do the enzyme and then making desirable chemicals complicated common chemicals and then that may be a viable approach to make more value added chemicals with specific structure and functionality. That's what I thought about. But I understand but I say as a note taker I would just do what open to everyone's I would write down everyone's comments, yeah.",

So presumably if you take you can sort of engineer a microbe of some sort to take CO2 and convert it to you know, like you say say you want a particular product, you can direct it so you get almost 100% selectivity as opposed to say heterogeneous catalysis you always have the issue of you know you ending up with different lots of products and you have a distribution of them. I'm just wondering what's like what are some of the prospects for actually sort of doing that work. So so let's say you engineer a microbe like CRISPR or whatever it is and this is just me you know really modeling off but",

            "transcript": "Right. So so I had I I I could say a little bit because but before I before I tell what my opinion, I would say I'm still a chemist by training. I got physical chemistry in PhD so I wouldn't say a fully knowledgeable about chemical biology part. But here's my take. The first part is a challenge is the throughput and the efficiency. The reason about that is if you think about heterogeneous catalysis electrolyzers, I mean they can the current density is pretty high. And the part of the reason is they they can you can run it in alkaline condition, you can give a lot of current go through it. But microorganism they have their good about enzymes but on the other hand they're fragile, right? You cannot dump them into KOH solution and most of them, right? And and so and you need to make sure that they don't die because you unintentionally generate some toxic species that just kill them. So that would be the challenges, how you can make sure it's scalable about the in the throughput part and make sure they are compatible. Another challenge I think about from engineering process is even though you can a lot of high current density now require CO2 reduction electrochemically is with gas diffusion electrode. And how can you do with that with the microbe there? And because microbe requires water around. And the corresponding question is because a lot of product are liquid phased, they are too large to be gaseous molecule. So how can you separate them? Right? Because you need to get enough titer or concentration so you can separate those molecules to make it economical and economically or energy wise feasible. I think on the other hand if you think about chemical biology part is I think we all understand that biological research take time. You need to grow. So sometimes you may not see a big jump in improvement because it just take very long time for people to optimize things and get what they want. So sometimes they're when I first started as a material scientist going into that field I realized the expectation is different. I I say I tell my student do the experiment tomorrow and you cannot tell that to biologist because they are a lot of steps you need to do before they can even do the experiment. So that that's my take about how you would like to interface with biological system and electrochemistry. It's a very interesting field and I I'm another challenge maybe is related why we as is good is I I try to apply for grant for this and I think we are lucky but sometimes if you talk to NSF, NSF would say I don't know it's for fitting CHE or CBET or DMR or it's all bioscience because it's interdisciplinary. So sometimes finding the right funding agencies is another challenge based on my own experience.",

I think that's a perfect example of coming up with these integrated systems, compact systems where you can actually do for example in the sites in a small scale but yet it's modular and it's portable.

I mean if you talk to Wilson Smith you will know that NREL they they do the modular approach that you have electrolyzer generate hydrogen and hydrogen fermentation has been a very well-developed process in industry. So if if in that case from pure engineering point of view there there could be just a one straightforward way just you have electrolyzer generate hydrogen and you separate nearby reactor that the microbe just fermentate that and give you specific product using hydrogen as a feedstock. And that's one of the approach I think engineering wise what people are moving towards based on my observation.",

But let me give you a little bit of background for all of you since not everybody knows the why we care about this particular topic, I guess. The reason is that it's basically actually being funded by EERE, which is interesting, right? Because all the CO2 work used to be funded by fossil energy because we burn fossil, you make a lot of CO2. But why renewable energy lab is interested in this? Because they think this is the kind of analogous to photosynthetic biofuel production. So it's a non-photosynthetic pathway, non-photosynthetic. So which means that the biological system not going to use sunlight, they're going to use energy from gas. So they're doing gas fermentation. To do that so, CO2 is at such a low in energy, you need to boost up that energy. So they can do it electrochemically making CO2 to CO or formate or anything bugs can eat. So what they're thinking is CO2 to C1 or C2 compound will be easier",
