I got physical chemistry in PhD so I wouldn't say a fully knowledgeable about chemical biology part. But here's my take. The first part is a challenge is the throughput and the efficiency. The reason about that is if you think about heterogeneous catalysis electrolyzers, I mean they can the current density is pretty high. And the part of the reason is they they can you can run it in alkaline condition, you can give a lot of current go through it. But microorganism they have their good about enzymes but on the other hand they're fragile, right? You cannot dump them into KOH solution and most of them, right? And and so and you need to make sure that they don't die because you unintentionally generate some toxic species that just kill them. So that would be the challenges, how you can make sure it's scalable about the in the throughput part and make sure they are compatible. Another challenge I think about from engineering process is even though you can a lot of high current density now require CO2 reduction electrochemically is with gas diffusion electrode. And how can you do with that with the microbe there? And because microbe requires water around. And the corresponding question is because a lot of product are liquid phased, they are too large to be gaseous molecule. So how can you separate them? Right? Because you need to get enough titer or concentration so you can separate those molecules to make it economical and economically or energy wise feasible. I think on the other hand if you think about chemical biology part is I think we all understand that biological research take time. You need to grow. So sometimes you may not see a big jump in improvement because it just take very long time for people to optimize things and get what they want. So sometimes they're when I first started as a material scientist going into that field I realized the expectation is different. I I say I tell my student do the experiment tomorrow and you cannot tell that to biologist because they are a lot of steps you need to do before they can even do the experiment. So that that's my take about how you would like to interface with biological system and electrochemistry. It's a very interesting field and I I'm another challenge maybe is related why we as is good is I I try to apply for grant for this and I think we are lucky but sometimes if you talk to NSF, NSF would say I don't know it's for fitting CHE or CBET or DMR or it's all bioscience because it's interdisciplinary. So sometimes finding the right funding agencies is another challenge based on my own experience. ",

But let me give you a little bit of background for all of you since not everybody knows the why we care about this particular topic, I guess. The reason is that it's basically actually being funded by EERE, which is interesting, right? Because all the CO2 work used to be funded by fossil energy because we burn fossil, you make a lot of CO2. But why renewable energy lab is interested in this? Because they think this is the kind of analogous to photosynthetic biofuel production. So it's a non-photosynthetic pathway, non-photosynthetic. So which means that the biological system not going to use sunlight, they're going to use energy from gas. So they're doing gas fermentation. To do that so, CO2 is at such a low in energy, you need to boost up that energy. So they can do it electrochemically making CO2 to CO or formate or anything bugs can eat. So what they're thinking is CO2 to C1 or C2 compound will be easier ",

        "utterance": "Alissa Park: electrochemically or thermochemically. Once we have that, we can feed that to biological system which can upgrade to C2 plus much bigger molecule much more selectively. So interesting thing is people who are working on electrochemical conversion for example, they were all used to work on formic acid, producing formic acid because it's easiest. But then the problem with what Chong was saying, separation was an issue because it's highly dissolved in low concentration in the soup, right? So you have to get that out. So what you're saying, well, why don't we make CO or something else which bubbles out a little bit more so that there's inherent separation of your product so that you don't have energy penalty in the back end. But then now, if you want to attach the biological system, you degas your gas, gaseous product, now this low solubility gas you have to redissolve to feed it to the bug, which is not a good idea in a sense when you think about it. So now everybody's moving back to soluble intermediate, right? So that if I make formic acid and bugs can just continue to eat it up. But when you think about it, we're going to have intermittent renewable energy, making your intermediates intermittently, and then now you have a bugs producing whatever rate, can you turn on on and off on and off easily seamless this system? Or the pH condition which is favored in electrochemical system would be okay for bugs down in the downstream because fluid will go in around the circle. So there are a lot of questions and the good thing is this is really beginning of conversation. And I think that's why a lot of people are going into this. ",

So yeah and another thing I thought about is as you said that converting the CO in the intermediate, another drawback of CO is that CO is toxic, I mean to human being, so probably CO is could be also toxic to organisms. And so and and so that is an actual design engineering design challenge because you want to give them enough CO so it can be further upgraded, but you still want to make sure you don't give them too much CO so it will kill them. So so that is another challenge if you're using CO as an intermediate. Hydrogen fermentator as fermentation as Alissa said, that's one of the approach, but another approach at formate I think is gaining favor now again because the formate dehydrogenase is a very well very widespread enzyme to loop into the ATP synthesis synthesis pathways. So that is I think people are working on now. And but depending on the there are different ways you can design the process and there will be different challenges. I agree with that. And I appreciate ERE are interested about that because I was trying to find how which which which agency can fund our project. But thanks for letting me know about this. ",

The the most appropriate and easier ones they make a tons of there are bacteria can make 99% of acetate. Bacteria can make 99% of methane or maybe 99 90% of polymer, polyhexanoate. You can directly get polymer out of CO2. We also work on bacteria that just fix ammonia, just fix nitrogen into ammonia. And we're and because they are bacteria that's a natural way of doing that. So is this their waste? Like they they release these things as waste? So so it really depends also depends. So in the case of acetate and methane, those are waste if they secrete it out. In the case of polymer, it's actually a rainy day fund for their energy budget. So what they do so they store the polymer inside their cell just in case that later they got starved they can reuse those. So that's a natural way they do it and but you can break up the cell later. That's why I talked about the separation challenge. You still need to break out the cell and you got a polymer out of that. In the case of of nitrogen, it's more complicated depending on the strain. If you think about natural symbiosis, actually bacteria secrete ammonia for plant to use. So those in that case it's a natural it's a soluble ammonia. But in other cases they make urea for themselves. And and in that case what we demonstrated is you don't need to separate those because it's organic fertilizer anyway. And those bacteria happen to be accumulate phosphate too. And if you think about the biggest use of ammonia it's a fertilizer. You have phosphate and nitrogen, it's the probably the best you want to get for the agriculture. So you don't need to you don't want you can just spray the bug in the field and that's how it works.

What it does is we're using a microbe that it's a soil microbe anyway. It eats hydrogen and it fix carbon dioxide and nitrogen. It accumulate phosphate in the solution and you basically you apply electricity by generating hydrogen and the bug basically using hydrogen as an energy source to make itself, accumulate phosphate and polyphosphate and fix nitrogen, ammonia and carbon dioxide from the air. And what's beneficial more is as you know for agriculture there are people like to use plant hormones to stimulate the root development. And it turns out that bacteria because it's soil it has a loose loosely defined symbiotic relationship with plant with soybeans at least. So so if you spray that into the field using the microbe itself, not only provide nitrogen source, ammonia and phosphorus source, it also provides some organic stimulus that facilitate the development of root system. So so it's so we thought that's organic anyway it's organic because you can think of microbe as a bag, you have nitrogen, phosphate there. So it's also have a beneficial is leaching. You don't have much leaching because they are encapsulated by the cell membrane.
