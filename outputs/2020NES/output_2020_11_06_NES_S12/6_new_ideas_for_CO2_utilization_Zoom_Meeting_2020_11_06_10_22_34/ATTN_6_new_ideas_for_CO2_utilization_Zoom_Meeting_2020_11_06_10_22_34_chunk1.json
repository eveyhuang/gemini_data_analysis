The argument is maybe enzymes still has its uniqueness in making complicated molecules direct from air and they did that for many years. So what we try but what you need is providing a more efficient renewable energy sources like solar panel. So how can you convert dump electron from a solid material into microorganism they do the enzyme and then making desirable chemicals complicated common chemicals and then that may be a viable approach to make more value added chemicals with specific structure and functionality. That's what I thought about. But I understand but I say as a note taker I would just do what open to everyone's I would write down everyone's comments, yeah.",

      "transcript": "This isn't necessarily a question at you Chong, but I mean I know there's been a lot of talk about using enzymes. So I guess the natural world is very good at taking CO2 and converting it into a specific chemical. So presumably if you take you can sort of engineer a microbe of some sort to take CO2 and convert it to you know, like you say you want a particular product, you can direct it so you get almost 100% selectivity as opposed to say heterogeneous catalysis you always have the issue of you know you ending up with different lots of products and you have a distribution of them. I'm just wondering what's what are some of the prospects for actually sort of doing that work. So let's say you engineer a microbe like CRISPR or whatever it is and this is just me really modeling off but to what extent are people actually sort of actively pursuing that approach where you take the microbe and you genetically engineer it so that it produce one particular product and then you sort of feed it with what's necessary and then go from there. I'm just wondering what some of the grand challenges are with that general approach.",

      "transcript": "Right. So I could say a little bit but before I tell what my opinion I would say I'm still a chemist by training. I got physical chemistry in PhD so I wouldn't say a fully knowledgeable about chemical biology part but here's my take. The first part is a challenge is the throughput and the efficiency. The reason about that is if you think about heterogeneous catalysis electrolyzers, the current density is pretty high. And the part of the reason is you can run it in alkaline condition, you can give a lot of current go through it. But microorganism they have their good about enzymes but on the other hand they're fragile. You cannot dump them into KOH solution and most of them. And you need to make sure that they don't die because you unintentionally generate some toxic species that just kill them. So that would be the challenges how you can make sure it's scalable about the in the throughput part and make sure they are compatible. Another challenge I think about from engineering process is even though a lot of high current density now with CO2 reduction electrochemically is with gas diffusion electrode. And how can you do with that with the microbe there because microbe requires water around. And the corresponding question is because a lot of product are liquid phase, they are too large to be gaseous molecule. So how can you separate them? Because you need to get enough titer or concentration so you can separate those molecules to make it economically or energy wise feasible. I think on the other hand is if you think about chemical biology part is I think we all understand that biological research take time. You need to grow. So sometimes you may not see a big jump in improvement because it just take very long time for people to optimize things and get what they want. So sometimes when I first started as a material scientist going into that field I realized the expectation is different. I tell my student do the experiment tomorrow and you cannot tell that to biologist because there are a lot of steps you need to do before they can even do the experiment. So that's my take about how you would like to interface with biological system and electrochemistry. It's a very interesting field and another challenge maybe it's related why we as is good is I try to apply for grant for this and I think we are lucky but sometimes if you talk to NSF, NSF would say I don't know it's for fitting CHE or CBET or DMR or it's all biosciences because it's interdisciplinary. So sometimes finding the right funding agencies is another challenge based on my own experience. You need to make sure which program to apply for.",

      "transcript": "I think one of the opportunities that comes to my mind is the from these hybrid systems I'm not an electrochemical expert but I guess one of the opportunities would be modular manufacturing of chemicals using these hybrid processes. I think that's something that most of funding agencies are considering that. I think that's a perfect example of coming up with these integrated systems compact systems where you can actually do for example in the sites in a small scale but yet is modular and is portable. I think that's the opportunity that that these hybrid systems could offer.",

      "transcript": "Yeah, I agree. I mean if you talk to Wilson Smith you will know that NREL they do the modular approach that you have electrolyzer generate hydrogen and hydrogen fermentation has been a very well-developed process in industry. So if in that case from pure engineering point of view there could be just one straightforward way just you have electrolyzer generate hydrogen and a separate nearby reactor that the microbe just fermentate that and give you specific product using hydrogen as a feedstock. And that's one of the approach I think engineering wise what people are moving towards based on my observation. But I try to shut up as much as I can because I'm a note taker anyway.",
