            "transcript": "calculate this reorganization energy and all these other parameters that it goes into theory and he said I never did right? So he never really calculate all these numbers that he uses in his theory and he was saying well I only took it from the experiments and I put it on my theory and the only trick that he did is you know he he just reorganized the entire equations that he have you know a half a page of equation into something that is simple but it just get parameters from experiments. So the lessons I guess from that one when I when I ask him is that well this model worked really well but he never actually calculate anything from you know from those reorganization energies and all these salvation things. So I was wondering it's extremely useful and it's certainly a model system that it's approximating more things so I don't know if you know we're talking about very a more accurate simulations with realistic stuff and also very simplistic models that can probably do more accurate and and efficient. So I was wondering because that electron transfer theory it actually it's in the middle ground right? It's complexity but also a model system. So but it's so successful and explaining many things so maybe also the two extremes are good but maybe we can also think in something in the middle just like the lesson we learn from from electron transfer with the Marcus theory.",
