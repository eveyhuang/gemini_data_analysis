Like is the catalyst stable? Is it selective and so on? I think theory has a way to take into account all of these inherent trade-offs and come up with some sort of an integrated design strategy.

But something more papers are coming up to especially in the machine learning field where negative means more information means something where you don't want to go. But that's still useful information. So we're biased to a successful results. But I wonder how I mean, I think pretty much every scientist that I have met, how we we depreciate negative results as something that we shouldn't even look at it, right? So, um, I don't know, I just wonder because there's these all these experiments, especially for synthesis that you can tell, you know, what temperature doesn't work or what solvent doesn't work or something. But that if you put these into a model system, let's say a training model or something, you will know that that directions will not be working, but it's still useful information. So I always um, you know, probably in in experiment and also in theory in in the theoretical fields, um, how we depreciate these negative results.

But there's something I think to be learned and we're trying to look experimentally, what's the difference between these two systems and how did we impart with such a small change in our structure this double the length, but I yeah, we're definitely limited. I think in our experimental techniques, I can tell you just by how much it died and when it died and we're trying to probe maybe charge transport properties.

But it almost sounds like it was more leaning more towards, um, if we're really trying to get into like a next generation of catalytic systems where you're going to be able to do things like break scaling relations, you're probably going to have to have inherently more complex systems so that you have multiple types of functional active sites that are controlled so that you can basically have cascades of different active sites for different steps in the pathway that are kind of optimized over. Okay? And then you get into the realm of I need to kind of explore systems that have huge parameter spaces, whatever they are, like they're if they're something like high entropy alloys or something where you've just got these poly elemental combinations of elements like organized in a particle or something, can we come up with efficient ways of exploring those systems? That's a place where I think my croscopy could actually be really, really, really powerful because if you make kind of just heterogeneous assemblies of these systems, you can kind of quickly screen through them and identify, you know, what's promising and then, you know, use theory to explain, predict, guide where we're going forward.",

I think, um, you know, for heterogeneous catalysts and I think it's hard to achieve, you know, very good selectivity to a desired product. And also the degradation can be very complex. I think probably approach like battery study have been doing is probably you can do multi models with cross studies, not only rely on one single technique. So then you can look at your system from different angles and which could give you a more comprehensive or full picture about what's going on in your system.",
