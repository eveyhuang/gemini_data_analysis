But I guess that's always a concern that are undergoing electrochemical reactions there's always some sort of degradation ongoing. So the true the real steady state is never achieved. ",

So even the degradation induced by shooting x-rays at it or even freezing and rearranging the water structure or the salvation of ions at your surface which is critical to understand these interactions and you would change it by freezing.
