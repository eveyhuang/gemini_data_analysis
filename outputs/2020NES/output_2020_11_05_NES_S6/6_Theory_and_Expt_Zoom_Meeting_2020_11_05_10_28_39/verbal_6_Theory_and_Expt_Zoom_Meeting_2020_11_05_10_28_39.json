So the lessons I guess from that one when I when I ask him he said, well, this model work really well, but he never actually calculate anything from, you know, from those organization energies and all these salvation things.

The way the whole field of development has evolved is that you have this artificial divide between quantum chemist and quantum physicist. Like quantum chemist work on these idealized gas phase systems and physicist work on these continuous systems. So no one bothered to benchmark things to the interface. So I think even the gas solid interface is a challenging thing for us to model, let alone a gas liquid interface. So I think there is some progress in figuring out like what these benchmark systems might be through like these single crystal uh experiments so to speak, which allow for us to at least look at how things bind at that interface and how our theories perform. So I I think electrochemistry electrochemical interfaces is a whole other ball game altogether, although I don't know much about them. Um but yeah, model systems, I think even for a gas solid interface is quite a challenge and any progress in that would be amazing. Um yeah, and the other issue of course is that all of these things are dynamic. So one way around it for defining a model system would be to try and pick out those catalysts that have uniform active sites. So in part of my group gets away with it because we look at molecular catalyst, but when it comes to interfaces, there's there's we have to look at the ensemble. And even if we do look at the ensemble, we still don't know how to get it up to experiments. So we are trying to do dynamics, but then dynamics again, there's so little you can do with initial dynamics. You can't really simulate realistic time scales.

But something more papers are coming up to especially in the machine learning field where negative means more information means something where you don't want to go. But that's still useful information. So we're biased to a successful results. But I wonder how I mean, I think pretty much every scientist that I have met, how we we depreciate negative results as something that we shouldn't even look at it, right? So, um, I don't know, I just wonder because there's these all these experiments, especially for synthesis that you can tell, you know, what temperature doesn't work or what solvent doesn't work or something. But that if you put these into a model system, let's say a training model or something, you will know that that directions will not be working, but it's still useful information. So I always um, you know, probably in in experiment and also in theory in in the theoretical fields, um, how we depreciate these negative results. It's really truly negative, but we don't appreciate as as useful information. ",

I think in our experimental techniques, I can tell you just by how much it died and when it died and we're trying to probe maybe charge transport properties.

But it almost sounds like it was more leaning more towards, um, if we're really trying to get into like a next generation of catalytic systems where you're going to be able to do things like break scaling relations, you're probably going to have to have inherently more complex systems so that you have multiple types of functional active sites that are controlled so that you can basically have cascades of different active sites for different steps in the pathway that are kind of optimized over. Okay? And then you get into the realm of I need to kind of explore systems that have huge parameter spaces, whatever they are, like they're if they're something like high entropy alloys or something where you've just got these poly elemental combinations of elements like organized in a particle or something, can we come up with efficient ways of exploring those systems? That's a place where I think my croscopy could actually be really, really, really powerful because if you make kind of just heterogeneous assemblies of these systems, you can kind of quickly screen through them and identify, you know, what's promising and then, you know, use theory to explain, predict, guide where we're going forward.
