            "transcript": "temperatures is by using these very approximate rate theories, right? We for for almost a century now we've been using transition state theory and assuming that all of these modes are harmonic. And we all implicitly know that there are deficiencies to this. And the the thing though is that like more advanced more accurate rate theories exist. So there's variational theories, there are semi-classical theories, all of them exist, we just don't use them because they're too expensive. So I think there is definitely room for finding ways in which we can make these more expensive theories more tractable. I think a lot of advances in machine learning, signal processing, all of these can be applied to like quantum chemistry to make all of this happen and and make those more cost effective. And and therefore make quantum chemistry predictions of rates more accurate. We generally throw out our rate coefficient predictions because we know that they're quite meaningless. We only compare barriers, we only look at potential energy surfaces. But I think there's room for rate predictions, accurate tunneling contribution calculations and so on. Like all of those sophisticated things which now exist only for model systems can be made more practical with all of the other advances that are going on in algorithm development.",

Um so yeah from from computation I think the the interface is still all the methods that we're still using is you know electronic structure, MD and to some degree Monte Carlo but I think the new wave of method development that I see pretty much everywhere is just implementing machine learning for something, right? Machine learning for develop for understanding the wave function or machine learning to understanding, you know, a guess of transition state and so that's where method development I have seen going in pretty much every area, you know MD and and so on. Um so I don't know my my my take on this is that is definitely the way to go but also because machine learning is so useful, so tempting, at the same time we still don't understand the basics of it, right? It works, we just don't know why it works at the fundamental level. So my um I guess concern would be if all these new models or new uh developments or methods work, do we really truly understand everything because really the machine learning part we don't fully understand it yet. We we just know it works. So it's just a question of um of once this method work and are developed and fully implemented, the question will be really do we really understand all this because really the machine learning is still not clear there.",

You know understanding how you would you would do these silicate reactions or such. So the geochemistry bit and and we hopefully one of the other sections will deal with that um in in we've got one of the discussion sections that will address um some of the experimental sort of theory measurement spectrum for for that set of reactions. Okay so we're down to the countdown. Any final thoughts or um anybody inspired to start thinking about some scialog projects here? Yeah? Great. Okay so this is this has been this has been awesome. I think uh scialog projects with theory and experiment uh you know mixes do really well uh because they they just seem to you know uh fill a need, right? And I think uh there's there's opportunities here that would be superb. Thanks Feng, this is uh this was very easy. You guys are all making it super easy so",
