            "transcript": "So speaking of the the big data sets, actually we are sitting on we are sitting on data that has been sitting in our computer for years, unanalyzed. Let me give you one example that we are probing the for example solid state materials and probing the redox reactions inside solid state materials with the with a three-dimensional spatial resolution. Now with a with a particle of 10 micron size, we are collecting 1.25 million XAS, X-ray absorption spectroscopy for for metal cations. So 1.25 million. So every time we do the experiment with over a week, we we get back with a 8 to 10 terabyte data. So it's at a point that we we we have to develop our own machine learning or other advanced data analysis method to analyze data. Unfortunately, we are still very slow on that end. We are still analyzing data that we collected a few years back. Now speaking of the other high throughput capability that there are a lot of experimental opportunities at at different synchrotron facilities where you can collect a thousand high quality, very high quality X-ray absorption spectroscopy spectra just in one day. Again, beamline scientists and and myself, we have been talking about how to streamline the data analysis using high throughput mode, but we are we are still not making progress on that yet. So the data analysis is still mostly just by hand individually.",

Since it's the 15-minute point, um, Jose, do you feel like you're getting enough to sort of talk about in our three-minute, uh, you've got your thing up there and it seems pretty it's fairly detailed.
