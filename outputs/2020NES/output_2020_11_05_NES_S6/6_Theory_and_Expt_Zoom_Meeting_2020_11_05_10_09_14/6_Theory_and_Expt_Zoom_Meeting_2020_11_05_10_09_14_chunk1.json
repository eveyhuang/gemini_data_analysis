Major, can we start with what sort of knowledge gaps exist in terms of science and then the need for theory and experiment to more better address each other's needs? Yeah as it pertains to NES. You all took some time to write something down. Does anybody want to throw something out there?",

So we actually have collaborators working on the theory side. You know, Yanyue Liu actually is one of our collaborators. We actually published a paper together last year. So one of the challenges we see in our experimental side is trying to understand the reaction intermediates, trying to figure out the reaction mechanism. Some of the tools we frequently use kind of probe the reactive intermediates but we have the trouble because the reaction intermediates usually have very short lifetime. And they are not really have a high coverage on the surface of the catalyst. So that's make even infrared or Raman become extremely difficult to see those intermediates. I think theory have a much better chance to really telling us what's going on the surface. And also I think on the other side I heard there are a few groups actually here also work on developing new tools to understand the electrochemical interface. I think it's definitely there's a need for us who working on the catalyst and also collaborate closely with people working on computational modeling and operando calculations. So that's my just two cents okay.",

Right? Anybody wants to add to that? What sort of methods could we get yeah go ahead.",

            "transcript": "Sorry I I can jump in. I I definitely agree with that perspective that the spectroscopy experimentally is very tough. So we're also strongly with vibrational techniques so turning to some x-ray absorption and emission spectroscopy to try to look at intermediates. I think some things that could be useful from a computational perspective to maybe complement these types of techniques is first even just modeling and predicting complex spectroscopies based on the molecular orbital geometry of the reactants intermediates and product species that we're expecting to see. I think also the hard part about this is really just bridging the gap between idealized models and then really messy systems and so that really comes down to what what Feng was also saying about signal to noise. So other things I was thinking about was techniques like modulation excitation spectroscopy that we can use for experiment but that actually do they would be significantly enhanced if there's appropriate sort of theory or data processing to supplement that and I think it's having expertise from a theoretical perspective would help an experimental group like mine really make the most of these approaches.",

            "transcript": "I can jump in a little bit. I think one thing from the theory side especially and this kind of goes back to what Linsey hinted at is just the complexity of the experimental environments and it's hard for us to look for something unless we know what we're looking for. So a lot of times from the purely experimental papers you have no idea what the real atomic type structure is and I can't build a model unless I can at least get some reasonable guesses of atomic structures to start from and test whether they're reasonable and things like that. So just kind of bridging that communication gap I think is a big challenge that I think a lot of the spectroscopy type stuff you're mentioning can definitely help with but is definitely difficult.",

            "transcript": "Sorry about this. Yes I also want to follow up on this. So I fully agree that the complexity in experiments is challenging for theorists. From computational side it's generally difficult to achieve a good balance between the accuracy and the efficiency. Sometimes we have to sacrifice the accuracy for efficiency so we can start for example we can start study large system we can study many materials but sometimes it's very important to consider those complex factors although they may cause significant computational cost. For example in I'm more familiar with the electrocatalysis and the solid liquid interface. So usually previously people often neglect for example the surface charge and also neglect the solvation explicit solvation and this approach this conventional approach is simplified but it's very successful in studying many different electrocatalysts because the computational cost is relatively low. However there are also many experiments that cannot be explained using such simplified approach and for those materials we really need to consider the for example the surface charge the explicit water solvation effect and without those consideration we cannot explain the experiments. So I think there is a strong need to develop and apply more advanced computational method to better understand the experiments.",

So real at least for electrocatalysis really getting at mechanism seems to be a big issue right and through identification of intermediates and simulations really of spectra and and but then the challenge from the theorists that are they're putting out is you've got to have some pretty good idea of what sort of structures you have so that you can at least enable model building as a as a first point. Any prospects for accelerating the cycle?",

            "transcript": "Yeah I could this would be a good spot for me to jump in. One of the things about naturally about most electrochemical interfaces is they're horrible and they're complicated and like many of the theorists have pointed out they need to have a really good idea of at least a starting point what the actual type of site that's dominating the chemistry or the reactivity of the system is which we often don't know from the start. That's actually a really appealing aspect of using microscopic approaches to actually mapping reactivity. So if you actually go down and locally measure where catalysis is actually efficient within these kind of macroscopic material systems you can kind of jump in a little quicker on that kind of feedback loop that we like to always envision works well where you have an experimental observation and then we theoretically predict or rationalize it and predict better structures right. I mean if we go down and identify already you know where the actual reaction is happening you can structurally characterize that and you can use that as a jumping off point for future studies.",

So probing the idea of model systems a little further any any particular ones that you think that you know people can benefit from or is there a need for model systems we should start there to get people theorists and experimentalists on the same page.",
