So we actually have collaborators working on the theory side. Leo actually is one of our collaborators. We actually published a paper together last year. So, one of the challenges we see in our experimental side is trying to understand the reaction intermediates, trying to figure out the reaction mechanism. Some of the tools we frequently use trying to probe the reactive intermediates, but we have the trouble because the reactive intermediates usually have very short lifetime. And they are not really have high coverage on the surface of the catalyst. So that's make even infrared or Raman become extremely difficult to to see those intermediates. I think theory have much better chance to readily telling us what's going on the surface. And also, I think on the other side, I heard there are a few groups actually here also working on developing new tools to understand the electrochemical interface. I think it's definitely there's a need for us who work on the catalyst and also collaborate closely with people working on computational modeling and ab initio calculations.

I think also the hard part about this is really just bridging the gap between idealized models and then really messy systems. And so that really comes down to what Fang was also saying about signal to noise. So other things I was thinking about was techniques like modulation excitation spectroscopy that we can use for experiment, but that actually do they would be significantly enhanced if there's appropriate sort of theory or data processing to supplement that.

From computational side, it's generally difficult to achieve good balance between the accuracy and the efficiency. Sometimes we have to sacrifice the accuracy for efficiency so we can start for example, we can start studying large system, we can start studying materials. But sometimes it's very important to consider those complex factors although they may cause significant computational cost. For example, in I'm more familiar with electrocatalysis and only the liquid interface. So usually people often neglect for example, the surface charge and also neglect the solvation explicitly solvation. And this approach, this conventional approach is simplified, but it's very successful in studying many different electrocatalysts because the computational cost is relatively low. However, there are also many experiments that cannot be explained using such simplified approach. And for those materials, we really need to consider the for example, the surface charge, the explicit water solvation effect. And without those consideration, we cannot explain the experiments. So I think there is a strong need to develop and apply more advanced computational measure to better understand the experiments.",

One of the things naturally about most electrochemical interfaces is they're horrible and they're complicated. And like many of the theorists have pointed out, they need to have a really good idea of at least a starting point what the actual type of site that's dominating the chemistry or the reactivity of the system is, which we often don't know from the start. That's actually a really appealing aspect of using microscopic approaches to actually mapping reactivity. So if you actually go down and locally measure where catalysis is actually efficient within these kind of microscopic material systems, you can kind of jump in a little quicker on that kind of feedback loop that we like to always envision works well where you have an experimental observation and then we theoretically predict or rationalize it and predict better structures, right?

Kind of building on that, one of the challenges of trying to have standardized model systems is that depending on your exact system, different computational methods are going to work better or worse. And so we could say, well, this method works really well for reactions at copper surfaces, but then you apply it to reactions at some sort of metal oxide surface and it totally fails. And so you can't really standardize things in that type of way. It just",
