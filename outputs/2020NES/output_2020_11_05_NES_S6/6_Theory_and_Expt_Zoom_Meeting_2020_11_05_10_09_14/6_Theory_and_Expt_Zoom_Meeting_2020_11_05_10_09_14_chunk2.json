            "transcript": "I suppose there is a strong need to study the model system. So as I mentioned previously, if we want to apply kind of more accurate and advanced computational methods to study for example the electrocatalysis, the challenge is that the computational cost is usually very high and we cannot do studies for many different candidates. So if experiments can narrow down the, for example, the structures of possible catalytically active sites, that will be very helpful for the theorists so that we would not waste much time on other unlikely candidate structures. So because the model system has well-defined structure and it's, I think there is a very good opportunity for experiments and the theorists to converge on the study of the model system.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I think kind of building on that, one of the challenges of trying to have like standardized model systems is that depending on your exact system, different computational methods are going to work better or worse. And so we could say, well this method works really well for reactions at copper surfaces, but then you apply it to reactions at some sort of metal oxide surface and it totally fails. And so you can't really standardize things in that type of way. It just...",
