And in my mind, I'll give a first first pass which hopefully you will all agree, disagree with is, essentially, what are the what are the control variables, right? You have a particular catalyst, you have particular reaction conditions. So concentration of CO2, medium, electrolytes, etc. And then a range of different driving forces such as voltage. And then other sort of photon or or if you're thinking photocatalytic, then photon driven and maybe P photoelectro catalytic. So maybe those are combined. And so what we want to be able to say is, given control variables as well as driving forces, what will be the product distribution when product distribution of this reaction? That's sort of the highest order. And the second granularity would be that if you could understand exactly how that product was reached or or what were the what were the intermediate steps. So I think first might be a reasonable achievement even if that's done. The second would be obviously from a science perspective, second would be the more important achievement.",

So I think for me because there's two other sections that are looking at mechanistic CO2 reduction, we should look at a bit bigger picture. And I think one of the things we should consider is maybe CO2 reduction directly won't make every product that we want it to. Maybe we're not going to be able to make methanol, ethanol, propanol. And so, understanding selectivity, I think, is still something that's very interesting and fundamental, but you know, I think to focus that could be the selectivity of CO2 reduction versus hydrogen evolution as one major bifurcation. And then, you know, what CO2 reduces to. I mean, my personal opinion is that at an industrial scale, electrochemical CO2 reduction at best will get us CO and formic acid, but I don't think at an industrial scale we're going to make any other product, and that's fine because I think the role that electrochemistry and electrochemical CO2 reduction can be making really stable robust precursors that can be converted by more, you know, advanced processes. So to me, you know, I think the discussion should be less about selectivity to kind of C2, C3, C4 products, but more this kind of intrinsic. One thing I think we all would agree, however we do this, water will be involved there somewhere and shutting off hydrogen evolution versus CO2 reduction as a main bottleneck.
