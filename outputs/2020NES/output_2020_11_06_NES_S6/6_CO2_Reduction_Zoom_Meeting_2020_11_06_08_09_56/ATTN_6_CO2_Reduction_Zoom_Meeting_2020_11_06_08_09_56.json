I am interested in heterogeneous catalysis and looking at adsorption but come at it from a surface science perspective. I'm currently working under ultra-high vacuum conditions, but my training takes things up to near-ambient pressures. So I'm very interested in thinking about carbon dioxide hydrogenation from a model catalyst perspective up towards near-ambient pressures. Nice to see you all.",
