It's kind of nice for silicon because that protect the surface from corrosion, but it's the other way is you stop the photochemistry right there, but to further along the conversion to make it all the way into things like aldehyde or CO2, um you sort of have to have a very high oxidative driving force and OH radical is the way to go. Actually that is the reaction pathway of the stratosphere getting rid of the methane and uh but it takes a long time because that's not so many radicals right there.",

So um perhaps we can do this is a looping chemical looping technique. It's it's uh two different states and they regenerate the active size afterwards. So I guess such absorptive methane so sorry, such absorptive membrane needs to go through maybe multi stage process of absorbing the methane and then activate it and then regenerate it because you don't you don't have a whole lot of it. It's just like catalyst of a glove box. So you don't regenerate every day, you just regenerate once per year. So that kind of thing. So once you have a big loading of your active sites, but you're not going to use it up uh very quickly, but but actually convert it later to some useful things.",

It"s kind of nice for silicon because that protect the surface from corrosion, but it"s the other way is you stop the photochemistry right there, but to further along the conversion to make it all the way into things like aldehyde or CO2, um you sort of have to have a very high oxidative driving force and OH radical is the way to go. Actually that is the reaction pathway of the stratosphere getting rid of the methane and uh but it takes a long time because that"s not so many radicals right there.",

So I guess such absorptive methane so sorry, such absorptive membrane needs to go through maybe multi stage process of absorbing the methane and then activate it and then regenerate it because you don"t you don"t have a whole lot of it. It"s just like catalyst of a glove box. So you don"t regenerate every day, you just regenerate once per year. So that kind of thing.
