And that's almost like a water splitting as a holy grail for photochemistry for for that is the methane to methanol is the holy grail for for that. It's as exactly as all of you mentioned Chong and Jeff and Samara. That's super difficult because the activation barrier to go over to activate to make it the methanol is already going can make the methanol go over the barrier further and getting over oxidized to CO or CO2. So that's a big challenge in the field, but there there are ways around it, I think.",

And so you in any case you're going to release CO2 from other sources in order to liquefy the two PPM that hopefully will be not anymore two PPM that will be like 100% concentrated, you know. It's hard because I'm working a lot with thermo chemical processes where I use high temperature and so I was thinking, okay, yeah, you know what? We can make like silver membrane where we can remove oxygen, right? And so removing oxygen at 21%, maybe will be not 21%, will be like 19% removed and so we can just a little bit increase the percentage of CO2, the concentration of CO2 in the air and the methane in the air, but still you have methane, nitrogen and CO2. And then you have to cool down because this process works at 400 degrees Celsius. And then you have to cool down and then you can process the CO2 and then you will end and you then you will end with nitrogen CH4 and then with the membrane where hopefully you will have like 1, 2%, you can capture or you can separate methane in a kind of separate series and parallel stages, you know? I'm not saying that it's impossible. I'm just saying that at the end of the day we have to be still negative, right? And we can make a process work. I we can do that. But at the end of the day will be not anymore negative.",
