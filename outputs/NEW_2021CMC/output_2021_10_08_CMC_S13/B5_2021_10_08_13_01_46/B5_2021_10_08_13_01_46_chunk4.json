That's sort of what we're arguing about whether or not that fluctuation is important or not or whether noise is important or not. Like is it that the one that's not doing what all the rest of them are doing is just irrelevant and then the other ones are sort of",

You switch the condition this object is supposed to be robust to a range of conditions. Then something that was irrelevant in the previous condition the redundancy now becomes important. So so definitely within the cell that has been shown many a times. Out like at an intercellular level I will not be able to comment but I haven't because I don't know too much about it. But definitely within the cell one of the reasons the redundancies are created so that it can be robust. And like essentially something that material systems try to achieve. They are engineered systems are very very efficient not as robust possibly. And that's what natural systems are basically more adaptable. And this adaptability comes in from the robustness from the possibility of having multiple signaling pathways with different weights and the weights of these pathways switch depending upon what environment you are in. So so that that is I think at least inside the cell is shown quite well. I would not be able to comment on intercellular communication part of it.",

So we covered some pretty big ones right up front which is you know is the paradigm of signaling at sort of the molecular level even accurate. I guess that's actually very interesting to when you think about it that way. And we talked about inputs and outputs right instead of signals per se. And we talked about amplification and crosstalk. I mean actually I thought that was very interesting because to me crosstalk I always thought of crosstalk as like a loss. Like you cared about this one pathway and anything that went to some other pathway was then be a loss for your pathway but if it actually helps amplify it then you know then that's actually again means we need to zoom out a little more when we're doing these studies perhaps right.",

So if there's no crosstalk there's not like a gauge mechanism right or for the cell to say oh now I need to do this and then I'm coming back to some type of a homeostasis and then oh I have to do this right. There have to be these crosstalks for the cell to to respond and respond in a in a fast time scale. So I think not only the crosstalk is not noise but it's an essential component of the ability of the cell to process multiple or respond to multiple events at once.",

You know there's a comment in the in the like prompt slide about signaling waves and those can only really exist if there are feedback loops uh that sort of temper the architecture of a signaling pathway. So it can look linear right but if there's still in within that chain a positive or negative feedback loop or the right combination of those you can get oscillations in signals you can get you know a rise followed by a dampening of the signal and so I think um it sounds like what we're all kind of saying is that the like knowing the architecture of the signaling pathway whether it's protein level or cell level or whatever organism level um like knowing the architecture is important so like the players the architecture and like the mechanism of information processing sound like the three things I've heard so far.

And like whether a system is is how is the system using that those those those set of pathways is of potentially very system dependent.

And so doing a combination of that and pathway analysis you know especially if you don't already have a signaling network that you know that you want to go after right. If you're talking about something that's already kind of established and you just want to use a tool to be able to go after it you know that's great. But if you're talking about you know because I was just reading rereading the the kind of summary about you know integrating biochemical and mechanical signals. In some cases we don't exactly know you know what the respondents are going to be to those mechanical signals right. And so you know the conversion of you know a mechanical signal into a biochemical or molecular signal right. And so it depends on if you're starting de novo in terms of what is known and what you're looking at or if you're just developing a tool for um you know something that is already known.",
