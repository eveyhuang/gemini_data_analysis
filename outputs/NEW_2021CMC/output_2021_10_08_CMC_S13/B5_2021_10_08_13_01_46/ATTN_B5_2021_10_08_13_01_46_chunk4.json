Uh that's sort of what we're arguing about whether or not fluctuation is important or not or whether noise is important or not. Um like is it that the one that's not doing what all the rest of them are doing is just irrelevant and then the other ones are sort of...",

      "transcript": "That's a great point. That's the idea of robustness. Might be it's irrelevant under one condition, but these are not the most efficient objects. You switch the condition, this object is supposed to be robust to a range of conditions. Then something that was irrelevant in the previous condition, the redundancy now becomes important. So so definitely within the cell that has been shown many a times. Uh out like at an intercellular level I will not be able to comment but I haven't because I don't know too much about it. But definitely within the cell, one of the reasons the redundancies are created so that it can be robust. And like uh essentially something that uh material systems try to achieve. Uh they are engineered systems are very very efficient, not as robust possibly. And that's what natural systems are basically more adaptable. And this adaptability comes in from the robustness, from the possibility of having multiple signaling pathways with different weights and the weights of these pathways switch depending upon what environment you are in. So so that that is I think at least inside the cell is uh shown uh quite well. I would not be able to comment on intercellular uh communication part of it.",

I mean if you study nothing but outliers, maybe it's easy to study them because they're so weird. But then you might be getting a very skewed idea of what, you know, normal is.",

If we just look at a single cell, we might find an example that does exactly what the average does but that's not going to be the rule. It's going to be the exception that we see exactly that.",
