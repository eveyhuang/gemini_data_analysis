That's always a fundamental question of how to link things up. So you go from the initial femtosecond whatever thing to some kind of macroscopic effect way out here right? That's the interesting thing. So okay so I wanted to start out by positing that question. I mean what are the what what are the roadblocks okay to be able to do this seamlessly? I mean is it do we need better okay we always need better experiments like what would those be and we need better theories okay what would those be? So yeah let's talk about what what are the barriers to making the perfect dream world of knowing what happens in various signaling events. And I'm being very general here. Okay so you can everybody should unmute themselves and be prepared to chat. Oh we have someone else coming in. Ronit.",

So is noise itself the signal? What is a signal in a sense or as far as the cell is concerned may not be fully understood and that makes it hard to track. I don't know if that made any sense.",

A good example of that is like immune cell activation like T cell activation works that way for example. And then there are other cases where it may be that one enzyme substrate interaction leads to another one then there's some amplification step like Michelle was saying downstream and so that sort of echoes Michelle's point that it really like the functional output depends on the signal at hand.",
