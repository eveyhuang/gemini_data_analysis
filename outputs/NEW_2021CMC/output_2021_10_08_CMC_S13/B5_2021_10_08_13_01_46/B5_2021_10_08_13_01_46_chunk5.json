Is that enough information to I guess define all the things we said you need to be defined, like what are the players, what's the maybe not the architecture but the players?",

So it's like a a like in a very clear case of a chemical signal called ROS its origin is starting from a chemical reaction at picoseconds and then its biological relevance stays up to seconds beyond which even if it stays in the cell no one cares the cell has a way of figuring its way out. So so let's say let's say if that is one signal then what else can we think of as as interesting signaling pathways and might be we can put in a times like I possibly managed to speak on on this particular thing that would be good actually then we can at least have a table of cool things.",

So so one thing that we have been thinking about is you know how you you can reprogram cells right so you have to reset chromatin structures chromatin modifications and so on but there's only a very small success probability of of that actually happening even if we start with a specific cell state. So we we've been thinking about and that's with some colleagues who have different expertise about how can you map out in time the cascades through which these cells go and which ones of them actually make it to the final state and then can we back propagate and and measure this kind of architecture of of that pathway in that sense I mean is it signaling I don't know but but so the one big thing there is we don't know the players we don't know what's going to change but at the same time it's also difficult to follow individual cells through that process. So so the idea that we have been putting forward it did not get funded but was to to put some sort of barcodes in the starting population so these barcodes get amplified so we can track daughter cells through the entire process and then find the barcodes that make it into the final sample and then backtrack and at every single time do these fishing experiments and see what is the population the distributions of states that we have at different time points and can we just construct the flow through this network of of states.",

So I would put that as a as one that is still very much open as to and very very active area of research in multiple across multiple fields. But I think there's another there's another bottleneck I think with something relates to to something you described where he said we poke right we poke a certain process or we poke a certain the poking is a bottleneck too right the way we poke currently is we inhibit right like we put an inhibitor and say okay or we or we delete a certain area in a protein or or whatever or we knock out we knock down we knock in depending on our model. But that's not necessarily if we completely you know down regulate and you completely knock out or you just alter right the the kinetics or you alter the amounts the gradients right.
