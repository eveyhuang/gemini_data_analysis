      "transcript": "you know how do you you can measure maybe measure some things at this length scale but then when you measure things at this other length scale or time scale how can you connect them right That's always a fundamental question of how to link things up. So you go from the initial you know femtosecond whatever thing to some kind of macroscopic effect way out here right That's the interesting thing. So okay so I wanted to start out by positing that question. I mean what are the what what are the roadblocks okay to be able to do this seamlessly. I mean is it do we need better okay we always need better experiments like what would those be and we need better theories okay what would those be. So yeah let's talk about what what are the barriers to making the perfect dream world of knowing what happens in various signaling events. And I'm being very general here. Okay so you can everybody should unmute themselves and be prepared to chat. Oh we have someone else coming on. Ronit.",

So is noise itself the signal you know what is a signal in a sense as far as the cell is concerned may not be fully understood and that makes it hard to track. I don't know if that made any sense.",
