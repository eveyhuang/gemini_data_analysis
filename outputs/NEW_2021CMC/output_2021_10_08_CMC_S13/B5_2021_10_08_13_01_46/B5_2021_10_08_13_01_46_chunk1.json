So what I did last time with my other groups has been so we go around and talk a little bit about each you know about ourselves a little bit and then we'll figure out who is going to be taking notes, which would be like the scribe function, and who will be reporting out at the end filling out that PowerPoint slide. And what I think works well is if we save like the last 15 minutes to get that thing done collectively. So so then we'll have about just under an hour to talk about this topic. Okay. So so I'm Cathy Murphy. I'm at the University of Illinois. I'm a chemist. I'm a nanoparticle person and we do work with cells in kind of, but not at all in the ways that this whole Scialog is about. But I'm interested in signaling at different scales because I do like to know what makes cells do things and of course in in my world we want to have nanoparticles like intervene with things, you know, which is always a lot of fun. So I'm going to go around and call people that I see in order on my screen and then so again, just say your name, where you're from. At this point we might know almost everybody. What your general research area is and then why you want to be here on signaling. Okay, so Rommie, you're next on my screen.",

So we don't do things directly related to signaling, but there's this one project we're really interested in which is quantum effects in very short hydrogen bonds and apparently they appear in some signaling molecules in like bacteria and stuff and they can hold their structure in their stable ground state and then when they sense light they can change configuration and start to do all the signaling.
