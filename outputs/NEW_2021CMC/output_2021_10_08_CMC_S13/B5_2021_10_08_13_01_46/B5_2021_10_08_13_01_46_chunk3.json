            "transcript": "Yeah and I think I think one of the other challenges that we are dealing with at least in the context of of transcription regulation is how do you even measure all these inputs and I agree it's it's some sort of no matter what the signaling part is but we have to somehow integrate many different inputs to to produce an output and how can we determine when do these inputs happen where do they happen is it okay to happen at different times and and you're integrating over a long period of time or do they have to happen at the same time to to immediately gate to the output. So so that's I think one of the big challenges and and disentangling those those time scales also until you can even measure the outcome if something happened.",

            "transcript": "It kind of sounds like Jan what you're saying and I I really like the way you put that that what one question is knowing what components are even interacting in the system but then there's this question of you know like let's say at least the question of the time parameter that and and also like what is the sort of like information processing equation or function right. So like one thing is knowing the components and when they come together in space and time but then the other question is well what is the for each system there may be a different way of processing information and converting that into a into a signal output whatever we want that to mean. So I think those are two open questions like cataloging the players and then for each system of interest knowing what the like what the processing function is basically the information processing function.",

            "timestamp": "02:21-03:32",
            "transcript": "That's exactly like in in information theory that's a very clear way of defining what a signal is. Your players are your constraints and your function is actually the entropy function rho log rho. When you maximize your uncertainty under the knowledge of these players the constraints of these players and then whatever comes out of that is essentially the signal. Might be a canonical distribution function if your players are position if NVT is are the players this is the only things that you know then the signal is this Gaussian distribution function. And so I think that's a very clear so and then essentially and that's where I think the the the field definition comes in every field brings in its own constraints and therefore what you call signal depends entirely upon what you're calling constraints. It's a signal under the prejudice of certain constraints and knowledge that you are are are putting into your into your thought process. So so yeah like uh again like in energy signaling that we often look into it's very difficult to see energy the way we classically define it moving through a cell it will have to so what can be monitored is some manifestations of energy transfer which can happen by changing concentration by monitoring things like the concentration of reactive species that tells you or or energy rich metabolites this is where the energy is moving through. So so again like we have essentially constrained our our information by by our knowledge of these these specific species that we can measure and then then whatever arises after that is a signal like basically. So so yeah I will now stop now.",

            "transcript": "Well I was interested about this idea of amplification right. I mean so right if a signal is going to mean something I mean it could just fritter away but if you amplify it then hey then you're it's more likely to lead to some outcome right. So I again I don't work in this area at all but I suppose we know for some particular systems in detail what the amplification process would be or maybe we don't maybe we don't know how things are amplified. And maybe that's something we should study if we don't know much about it. So any comments on this theme of amplification? Markita.",

            "timestamp": "05:11-07:07",
            "transcript": "I think that the brain is a wonderful example of this because it's it's these neurons that have these basically binary signals in terms of action potentials right. They have depolarization events and a pre versus post synaptic neuron communicates that message electrochemically basically right. So depolarization here causes depolarization here but they're they're not physically touching right so unlike a circuit there's no way for that electrical information to be transduced and so it's gated by chemistry right that that is exocytosed here and then affects receptors on the post synaptic neuron to then you know relay that signal downstream and it's it's interesting because I think this is where that concept of tools comes in as well. Being able to measure action potentials is something we've been able to do for at least about a decade or so and we've used that almost as a proxy for their chemical signaling but as new tools become available to look at the chemistry it's becoming apparent that for every action potential there could be as little as a 5 10% probability of actual neurochemical release. So it it touches on a lot of themes I think that that we've been discussing here about how more sensitive tools spatially and temporally are allowing to see kind of these new dimensions of information. The other kind of way that we classically at least in neuroscience probe how it is that that these signals are transduced is with pharmacology right so we add drugs to the brain we know that they agonize or antagonize receptors and so we make conclusions about what that agonist or antagonist action does and and where the role of those receptors are in the pre versus post synaptic neurons and but it's still I think that's still a very hazy method of of understanding signaling in an organ that that arguably is the main signaling pathway of the entire body.",

            "transcript": "I really like this theme of uh I guess the what's the information processing equation how you talked about amplification. I guess the component I would add to that is the unknown levels of crosstalk within signaling cascades. So often we might think oh this is our signaling pathway it involves this linear cascade but there are other signaling pathways and the crosstalk there that's unknown and its contributions becomes a challenge.",

            "transcript": "And that's where I would actually support Masha's theory. This crosstalk cannot be achieved without noise. So this is weird. Amplification needs noise. Without fluctuation you cannot get amplification. So so so essentially in this in the sense of this information theory theoretic setup what happens is like you start increasing fluctuation and you reach this critical fluctuation where you suddenly see amplification and you cross that fluctuation again and that amplification this amplification is gone. So so that that that that critical noise is extremely is extremely important. Like so so that's that's that's critical actually like so fluctuations are critical for amplification that's what I would uh uh say like that at least in a lot of areas that has been shown.",

Um so so so it's it's only somewhat related but but you know thinking about our our transcription regulation chromatin structures and so on so one thing that that is really puzzling is that there is so much cell to cell variability which is noise I guess in a sense. You still get regulation but if you look at an individual cell it may look completely different from from what your population looks like right and and that's that's maybe what you what what Markita describes about action potentials you know so some 5 to 10% of the time it works but most of the time it doesn't. And and if you look at all these population studies you say oh yeah enhancers need to contact promoters and then transcription happens. But you look at an individual cell and they're they're far apart there is just no good way for them to communicate.",
