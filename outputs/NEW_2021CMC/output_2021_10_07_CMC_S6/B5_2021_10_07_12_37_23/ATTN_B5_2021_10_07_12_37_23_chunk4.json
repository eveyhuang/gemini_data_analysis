      "transcript": "also not an expert on AI ML but we apply that in our work. But so I'm we're not upset by AlphaFold but something I thought maybe just philosophically speaking is when there's a lot of data available and where if there's enough commercial interest in generating an AI machine learning based on that model, AlphaFold or a similar thing is bound to happen that it's hard for a single academy lab to compete with something like Google. That's what I thought from the field dynamic. But also related to Lu Wang's question, I agree. So what my lab has been trying to do is can we generate data that look at how chemical condition affect function of protein or or say the interaction with other protein and then be able to generate that data at high throughput and then use that kind of data to really advance study of proteins. So that kind of data to me does not yet exist in the database based on my understanding but others can correct me. So I thought that I thought if we can build out that database combining experimental and then combining high throughput technology that that can help us to generate data in the new direction. Also similar to what Abhishek mentioned about protein prediction of protein in living cell or living cell database for PDB.",

So I'm going to give Stephen Yi an opportunity to to bring to sort of wrap up this discussion and to as well as to bring up some of his questions. And then of course you can always jump in and and modify if you want to before we go to the next topic. And Rommie I'm going to let you choose the next topic. Go ahead Stephen.",
