I would love to be able to say what in this big data set should I believe more seriously versus what's maybe more at the edge of noise. And that I think is probably, it goes back I think to what we were saying, which was having really good databases that are really well curated is a beautiful thing for experimentalists and it's an even more beautiful thing for machine learners. But how do we create those standards that everyone agree to that is this level of quality and then when there is noise, what do you do with it?",

And the second thing is, I'm concerned that we sort of have gotten into a naughty Nash equilibrium, which is that the only answer is we need more data and and and we need more computer time to analyze that, I mean to we need to be able to have enough machines to analyze that data, et cetera. Could we have something more than just that we need more data or better data or or or better databases? I mean I think we've had a lots of discussions where we had the possibility of maybe a different types of unknowns and maybe we could emphasize those as well.",

Like if you have this pool of images, when you train, you discriminate between the image that is expected versus not expected. And then based on that, and again the now the discrimination based on what features of that image, that's where the problem comes in. The discrimination itself is there. So I would say if I have to like, if it's not structural data, if it's image, I think pixels, I think you know, the intensity of of of of color in a particular pixel is a very good indicator of training imaging data. So if we if we know that, if we have real examples of a pixel by pixel intensity of a map, then that can be learned very well. So yeah, that's one example I can think of from from an imaging perspective.",

Let's assume that we don't have a way to get better data or more data. I think putting back a little more physics in the in the models allows us to simplify the model. So instead of going super deep like three layers or or a deep neural network, you start thinking in terms of, well I represent my data in a in a more efficient way and then I don't need three layers of neural network, I may need to train only one or I may even do I may even be good with a linear model, even though high dimensional. And that's a way to go when you don't have enough data or you're not fully confident about the quality of your data.",

I think Abhishek noted that where where the the PDB-Dev kind of starts to do that and and that we need to have room for that. In the PDB, you can't, you don't always have to just deposit a single protein, it's just a little bit, there's just not that many cases where there are protein pairs or bounded or or multi-domain structures. I think I think you can deposit that, just people don't usually do that for whatever reason. I think Dev is not development, it's deviation, now that I think about it.
