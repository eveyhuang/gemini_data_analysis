And so if you could also detect you know heat evolution at a very like you know microscopic length scale that would be really compelling.",

And in my own institution we have a lab Matt Good's lab uh is also a Nature Chemical Biology paper which he designed several pieces of used several different IDRs to fuse into the entire biological pathway different enzymes to coordinate the entire biological event which he named it to to artificially design different cellular compartments to coordinate a cell event.",

The RNAP the RNA polymerase. Yeah sorry. Um and that happens in E. coli as well.
