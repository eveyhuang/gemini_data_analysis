So the other question is whether we are talking of a real phase separation or it's just things sticking together and there is a focus on the heterogeneity of of these environments. The yeah I don't think we need to well okay. There is a question about the composition of these droplets that came out lately and how can it be probed. There are various techniques like mass spectrometry, sequencing, proteomics and whatever else. The problem one of the problems is isolating these droplets. And then there was a discussion about probes of uh I mean like in situ probes to for example measure local temperature or supply energy locally and see what happens. And the techniques that came out and that are somewhat available now we're talking about super resolution microscopy, fluorescent dyes, small molecules or nanoparticles, there are plasmonic nanoparticles also we haven't talked about it, magnetic rotors that can probe viscosity.",

I do wonder and I should look into it about extremophiles and how they have adapted or phase separation or not in their living in these more extreme environments that would otherwise be stressed. I have this just like to be contrarian is the you know these are all macromolecules that are reasonably high concentration so why wouldn't they phase separate? And so is it actually the opposite is that everything has a tendency to phase separate and the cell spends energy to keep it in phase.",

I mean like one like quote that I always find kind of amusing is that like it's someone once pointed out I mean like the more interesting question is maybe why most proteins don't phase separate.

And though I I wasn't familiar with this until until very recently. That's the stickers and spacers model. Exactly. But it's really multivalency it's like kind of hydrophobic collapse would have which happens with protein folding in a way too right? So then the question is is it really the same processes that um control globular protein folding versus assembly of these these phase separated aggregates. And if so then really yeah that that question is like super interesting of what prevents it and controls globular protein folding.",

Yeah and we like coming from the polymer side of things we often think about these complex coacervates which are traditionally driven by electrostatic interactions. Um but the best most available polyanion in the cell is RNA which we think of okay this is a great polyanion but so much aromatic character as well that I think is hugely important.

I mean that's what this whole thing is about right? I mean the the more discussion we have and we connect people throughout you know common interests with complementary techniques and and all that stuff I think that's fabulous. Okay
