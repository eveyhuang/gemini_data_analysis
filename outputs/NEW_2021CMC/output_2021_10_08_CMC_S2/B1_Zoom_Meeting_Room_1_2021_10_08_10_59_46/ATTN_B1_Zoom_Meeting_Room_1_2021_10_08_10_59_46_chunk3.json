I feel like it is important to distinguish between a phase separated you know kind of this transition phase transition and just things that stick together. There's fundamentally different physics or different you know dynamics going on there. I don't know is that is that true? I'm not an expert in this at all so.",

So I think that like it's probably fair to say that like most experiments that are done by cell biologists like fail to give a level of evidence to really prove that which I used to be very hung up on but now I'm just sort of more like you know whatever they are they're still probably important.",
