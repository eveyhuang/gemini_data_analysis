So if you if you say that like a signal is a consequence of this thing doing something to that thing or these two things interacting, often times that's a spatial relationship. I guess it doesn't always have to be but so if it's a protein-protein interaction what is the what is the protein-protein interaction? Because just knowing two proteins are in a pathway is not the same as knowing that they're like the the pathway is defined by this one interacting with that one right? That's an extra layer of information. Same goes with like a collection of neurons in the brain right? If they're like knowing which ones are touching which ones is perhaps important information.",

It can be a a a connectivity in in some space. But as long as we detect that I think through imaging if anything is spatial then we can get that. Through proteomics possibly and data mining thereafter if something that is that's definitely not spatial but some connectivity some yeah.
