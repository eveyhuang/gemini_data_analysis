Then we need better theories. Okay, what would those be? So, what yeah, let's talk about what what are the barriers to making the perfect dream world of knowing what happens in various signaling events. And I'm being very general here.

But I I think we can go down this weird road of saying how do you define biochemical? But maybe we don't want to push that. But but I think that's a fair point. I mean like it could be a mechanical change, it could be something else, right? But I think for us anyway, it really is, you know, some interaction which in our case is a biochemical interaction causing like a functional change in the players that we're sort of defining as the the the system. But it's true that like for depending on the scale of the the sort of output or phenotype you're interested in, right? It may be that you require integration over multiple of these events or, you know, that one of these events happens for a long period of time or something like that. So I think that sort of echoes Michelle's point that it really like the the functional output depends on the signal at hand. Really there are and there are measured examples of cases where you need several short time scale events to be happening in a small time frame and the system is integrating over that before it makes a sort of decision. A good example of that is like immune cell activation by like T-cell activation works that way for example. And then there are other cases where it may be that one, you know, enzyme-substrate interaction leads to another one then there's an amplification step like Michelle was saying downstream and so",

If I'm wearing my my if I'm taking down my chemist hat and putting on my computer scientist hat, I don't know that I am looking at signals, I'm looking at inputs and outputs and then as you said the the overall signal is like the functional consequence, that's how you define it, right? Which is different, right? Because you have multiple inputs and outputs constantly going, right? And at the end the cell makes a decision. You know, so to me that final decision and it can be also conflicting inputs and outputs, right? Like so so the cell has to somehow process it, right? It's getting multiple inputs, those inputs can all go and and and direct into a certain fate or a certain process but they can also be conflicting, right? At this point it's interesting to understand how the cell makes a decision, right? How the cell chooses or how it computes all these different types of inputs and at the end decides, right? And but but then so those can be multiple traditional signaling pathways as we call them, right? There can be multiple pathways go go on in parallel, right?
