I mean, what are the what way what are the road blockages, okay, to be able to do this seamlessly? I mean is it do we need better okay, we always need better experiments, like what would those be? Then we need better theories, okay, what would those be? So what yeah, let's talk about what what are the barriers to making the perfect dream world of knowing what happens in various signaling events. And I'm being very general here. Okay, so you can everybody should unmute themselves and be prepared to chat. Oh, we have someone else coming on. Ronit?",

Actually, I think Avi and Michelle and I were discussing this a little bit yesterday, but I think one of the barriers may be just even it's kind of one of these unknown unknowns or known unknowns or I've got lost. But you know, I think even this picture of okay, some conformational change happens here and that causes a cascade down the line, that itself may not be an accurate picture of how signaling in cells works. So is noise itself the signal? What is a signal in a sense as far as the cell is concerned may not be fully understood and that makes it hard to track. I don't know if that made any sense.",
