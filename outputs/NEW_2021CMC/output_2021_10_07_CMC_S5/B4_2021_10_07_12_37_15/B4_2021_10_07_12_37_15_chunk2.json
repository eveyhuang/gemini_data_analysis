And I feel like in the folding field, if we think about crowding, we can predict what's going to happen to proteins based on crowding alone. So crowding stabilizes proteins, it stabilizes binding interactions and and so from that perspective from a well-structured protein, we can make pretty good predictions. But what we don't understand is how the other parts of the environment are affecting the stability of proteins or predicting how like non-steric interactions are affecting the protein interactions. So I thought this was a nice juxtaposition to what Paul was saying about his specific system.",

            "transcript": "Yeah I think a related question is in these phase separated granules which are concentrating certain proteins a lot of these are I'm interested in RNA binding proteins a lot of these are RNA binding proteins and so they have some binding specificity and that might be on the nanomolar range but then in these condensates they're micromolar and so do they still maintain this specificity when they're at such high concentrations or is specificity lost in these condensates when the concentrations are much higher than they are in the normal cytosol and I haven't seen this really addressed and I don't know if it's because it's a very difficult question and it's not answerable or if it's just people haven't tried to get into it. I mean because there's a lot of what RNAs are in these granules because we don't know we might not be certain of what the function are and if we understand the components and how they get there that seems important and people have tried to say oh we see these RNA binding proteins in there and that's why these RNAs are in there but it could be the opposite that the RNAs are in there and they're pulling their RNA binding proteins along for the ride and I think we have this thinking of just like oh the RNA binding proteins are defining the specificity but that doesn't make a lot of sense once I feel like we start really getting into the concentrations within these granules and again crowding versus concentration are kind of interrelated to me but this is something that comes up in my head that I haven't seen good experiments to try and disentangle these things of what's going on and how the chemistry changes in these condensates.",

            "transcript": "That's very interesting so that that connects on many levels I think to to what we're thinking about. We we're working on condensates in the cell nucleus specifically related to transcription and you know this this whole idea that things just phase separate in the nucleus is obviously more complicated because many of the condensates are anchored to specific chromatin sites right so so there needs to be some cue to do it in that place and not elsewhere and and transcription nascent transcripts might be one of those triggers and that would be what causes the nucleation. The other thing that we're thinking about and and that's somewhat related to crowding maybe not is is the the scaffold structure that is underneath you know what what kind of chromatin structures impact on condensation is it is it something where we create a scaffold that favors nucleation is it something that excludes the volume which which creates a space for the condensate to form does it push out",
