But Josh, one thing that was very interesting about what you said is the idea of doing a time independent measurement for example on a fixed cell which in general is more realistic versus a time dependent phenomenon. It is so we haven't heard too much about looking at these condensates let's say in a fixed cell that it is is this a possibility or is it not?",

We we've taken I mean obviously not everything that clusters is a condensate, right? So a fixed cell alone will hide a lot of the dynamic information but what we have done in the past is is really quantitatively measure size distributions for example. If you have your very specific thermodynamic model of how things nucleate and grow and then disassemble again and you can measure a size distribution then the size distribution is very closely related to the free energy function, right? It's just probability is related to free energy difference. And so if you have this distribution then then can tell you something about mechanisms of how things nucleate and form and disassemble again.",

      "transcript": "One issue I guess we've found whenever you try to fix things is that the chemistry inside these condensates is not the same as everything else and so they might not be fixed in the same way. Where we've tried to look at RNA fish of localization to these condensates and then by the end of our fixation the condensates are gone. And that you need different chemicals to be able to fix them properly versus the rest of the cytosol. Again it's just kind of a side thing that I agree that getting quantitative information is super important to understanding these things and there hasn't been enough of that but that it can be more difficult than just using the properties that people have used on normal fixation or normal chemistry because just again everything seems to be changing.",

I have a I actually have an unrelated question. I wonder whether any biochemical activities or cellular energy states that explain or contribute to the dynamics of the condensate because a lot of like a composition component protein component in the condensates are enzymes like ATPases enzymes. So no matter RNA drives the condensate or protein drives the condensate, the RNA protein interaction definitely are in the condensates but those ATP-ase activity would change the equilibrium of the RNA protein interaction. So and that's correlated with the cellular state like younger people has more mitochondrial function than more senior people, things like that. I wonder whether those biochemical activities underline some dynamics of condensate and whether that's correlated with the cellular energy state. No idea on how to measure or technology development is just not my strength.",

      "transcript": "Yeah I think if you can generate a contrast between kind of a steady state non-equilibrium state that we observe in cells, living cells, and a kind of more thermodynamically equilibrium state that Joshua mentioned, if you can generate a contrast, for example Jan mentioned that he measured size distributions of such such aggregates or liquid droplets essentially. If you can do that in a living cell and then you can basically kill the cell and deplete the ATP and see how thermodynamically things are now changing, maybe the droplets are now coalescing into larger droplets, how that changes. And that would be pretty cool if you can generate this contrast. What what does the non-equilibrium steady state where everything is moving, you have molecular motors kind of zooming through it, probably kind of pushing things apart, while if you don't have that anymore, how how do things change? That would be pretty cool.",

      "transcript": "So they've tried to do this in yeast. There's a couple paper, Carsten Weiss lab and Simon Alberti, they had differing opinions on what was driving this because there's pH changes and then there's ATP depletion during like glucose starvation. And they said that the whole cytosol becomes glass-like, just that everything, just all diffusion slows as you drop ATP in the cell. Um again, whether that's conserved, exactly what was driving it was unclear. One paper was saying it's pH changes, other was saying it's the ATP drop. But it does seem like they're not just changing the condensates but that everything becomes just like frozen kind of if you get",
