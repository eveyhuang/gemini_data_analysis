And for that the interactions of C and B and C and A are of course also important. But if you have multiple fret pairs that you can monitor all at the same time in different channels you may be able to kind of disentangle that and then actually explain some of the more general mechanical properties that you can observe. That would be fantastic. Tall order.",

So label one partner with one fluorophore and the other with another and monitor fret between them and we use temperature perturbations to get on and off rates as well as binding affinities and then mapping that to regions of the cell. So we see differences in affinity in vitro in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus and I do have some evidence for differences in droplets at least for motion into and out of the droplet at different temperatures. So it's something we can look at and we've built a three-color system to try and do assembly. But something I'm also interested is in the structure and the activity inside the droplets and so PFK for example is thought to form a filament structure and that's been seen in vitro but not in cells. So using infrared spectroscopy or infrared imaging we're hoping to look at the actual structure in in the droplets and then by using infrared labels in a region that is free of infrared modes monitor activity associated with those different structures. And then we use our perturbation techniques to cause phase separation to occur and look at changes in the activity. So we get kind of a spatial map of activity in the cell.",

So I think three is is a reasonable goal for us right now but then by moving the third probe you can map everything together. So keep two the same and move the third and then in the end you can overlay everything. Then in the infrared you're unlimited in your probes right because you know we have basically two million vibrational spectra from 800 wave numbers out to 2000 wave numbers. So if we can create a unique probe we can use that to monitor activity in the cell and they can be much smaller than our fluorescence probes.",

Also you know heavy isotopes have a unique vibrational mode so if you feed a cell glucose for example you can monitor incorporation of the C13 label.

I guess one I guess the relevant question that I guess I I would have in kind of my draw on some of what was said was just you know it's you know whether or not there's any possibility for for you know measuring sort of you know physiologically relevant aspects of the dynamics of of of condensates without temporal resolution or whether or not you know sort of like any any type of information we can hope to have or any any type of measurement that we could hope to have relevant information must necessarily be measurements at the time scale of the phenomenon of and I guess like you know any you know I guess you know the kind of the side question of that is whether or not sort of in order to kind of infer kind of you know that kind of short time scale information from from ensemble averages of of of particles whether or not we would have to have a very clear understanding of sort of the you know the the actual kind of non-equilibrium physics of of of condensate formation and or or or whether or not there's you know there's something maybe you know a little bit more zero knowledge that",
