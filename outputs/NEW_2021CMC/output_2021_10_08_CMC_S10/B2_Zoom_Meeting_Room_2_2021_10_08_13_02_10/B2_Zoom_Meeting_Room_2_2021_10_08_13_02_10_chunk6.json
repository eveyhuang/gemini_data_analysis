And there is a little bit of a push to try to acknowledge education and mentoring a little bit more but I'd love to hear you guys' ideas as to how to make that stronger.",

So it's kind of your first impression of you know this is this is what this person thinks and this is what another person thinks and you know I have I have mine published on my lab website because I think it should be transparent and there were some things that I didn't understand and there are these like unwritten rules right in in grad school that if you don't know someone to help walk you through the process you might never know.

            "timestamp": "02:22-04:45",
            "transcript": "I think too like advancing student groups is also really important because often times as you know Alice pointed out it's not necessarily the right relationship to be mentoring students on like the different stages that they're personally experiencing from an advisor point of view because of the power dynamic and because of the different stages that one's at in one's scientific career. Sometimes I've found personally that like student support groups can be very effective at at being able to navigate some of the specific tensions and issues that students are encountering at a certain place in their career. But I think the other the other point that I was going to bring up is just you know all of the things that we were talking about the topics of of stress and expectations and sort of conformism if that's a thing is really kind of limiting the creativity of of students I think and I think that's really a crisis for science right now because even I think there was like potentially a time when there was a lot more freedom and just sort of individual just passion for something that may or may not have been recognized but when you're at a certain stage you don't know what's cool and what's not cool and I think that you know as things become more systematic and more processed and you have all of these metrics that are applied at earlier and earlier levels of how to get into grad school and you're in grad school how many papers you need and who you need to work for and what postdoc you need to get I think that's really eroding the creative thought of a lot of our students and and that's a problem and it would be nice to build in some mechanisms to just sort of reinvigorate sort of a curiosity that doesn't have as many consequences if it doesn't pan out in their CV. So if there were ways to sort of do that you know reintroduce that at the graduate student level I think that would really sort of at least help people preserve some sort of like naive creativity which is really helpful and useful in all discussions.",

So you know they have so much time I want to say I don't see why people cannot switch and I know many people that switched and I think it's most times is a change for the better. I've rarely seen that you know be a change for the worse or or or nothing. I think if they're motivated about grad school they change right.",

But I will say again that the most enabling thing that could be done in science funding is to just fund the students because a big hurdle for a student is well okay so I want to change labs but does advisor X have funding on their grant? You know the answer is I don't know. You know and if if not then I need to stick with this person that that has money to to pay me. Whereas if you pay the students then you know they can shop around. It would also make it easier for students to collaborate with multiple people because again there's no infighting about this grant or that grant where you're getting the funding from it's the student is paid. You know if your research requires that kind of knowledge and this kind of knowledge you can go to two people and and get what you need there.",

I think just to play devil's advocate the argument I've heard against it is you know that if we weren't so invested in our students because we worked so hard to fund every single one of them you know we would just kind of let them float around and we wouldn't you know whereas it's like okay I'm you know this student you know I'm I know that I'm not just going to have another student come through the door unless I'm you know lucky and get another grant or something. So like I really need to you know focus on this you know every one of my students and their projects I can't let any of them float. So I'm just curious if anybody has any does everybody universally support that sort of funding should be for the students and more in the students' agency or are there downsides to that?",
