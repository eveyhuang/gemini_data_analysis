What do we actually value, you know, what is a good scientist? And I kind of think that this has to change if we're going to change the face of science. We're going to we need to grow a bigger appreciation for different kinds of skill sets and what different kinds of people can bring that's not, you know, first of all may not be credentialed in the way that we're used to and it may mean that we have to, you know, think harder about what what skills can really push our science forward? Does it always have to be, you know, do you always have to be a leader to push science forward?",

So Karen Fleming in our biophysics department here has been we're piloting a sort of a hiring I guess strategy that I think was developed by one of the departments at Yale, maybe Caitlyn knows, I don't know who, but where the first round of the process will be anonymous where basically like they'll the candidates will have to like prepare statements about their prior research experience, their future plans, their teaching statement, etc. in a way that sort of would not reveal like who they've worked for and like sort of create this implicit bias of, you know, essentially without us like saying it out loud, we tend to hire people from like the same few institutes and the same few labs within those institutes. And so I'm really excited to see what happens with it.",

      "transcript": "Thanks. So when I teach freshman chemistry, I have this writing assignment early on where I ask them to flip through the textbook for five minutes and think about representation in the textbook. And like and when the when the students write about whether or not they could find any human beings because maybe in five minutes if they have like a slow internet connection and they're looking through the ebook, they don't find somebody doing chemistry in their general chemistry textbook. But a lot of them they sometimes they find like Dmitri Mendeleev or Marie Curie and and and some of them say, you know, I'll I'll never be like, you know, I don't want to be a famous chemist or I'll never be a famous chemist. And like and these these intro textbooks, they don't tell you that, you know, you can be a you can be a professional and you can be a leader without being a pioneer, you know? And and so like there's this gatekeeping in intro science that's really I think unfortunate. But maybe that's kind of like on a on a younger level than what we're trying to discuss in this breakout room but",
