      "transcript": "NSF actually funded departments by giving them training grants. And that was not the exception which it is now where like you're lucky if you're a student you get into a biophysics training grant, but 90% chance your advisor has to support you on something. 90% of the students were paid on training grants and they could shop around for advisors and they had the money. And when you were on one of these training grants, you knew exactly how much you were going to TA and how much time you had for research because there couldn't be like the surprise your your advisor suddenly doesn't have funding, right? If you got that funding you had it. So I would be a big advocate in fact for somehow changing the entire funding system, that's like a big big big problem. So that it's not focused on individual PIs and requiring them to get like a lot of stuff done and then exploiting students to get them done. Because right now, right, in this system if I get an NIH grant and have a student that's been working in my lab for four years and they're really good now, I stick around for another four years, right? I'm going to get more out of you than out of a second year grad student that's just starting. And this is the kind of thing Erika, whether isn't anything the department heads really do or the deans do, they are part of the problem, right?",

It's so hard to run a graduate program now that we are keenly aware of exactly how long everyone's taking to get through grad school. So it's, you know, that's actually kind of I agree with you, a mature graduate student is often in the prime of their creative life and it's but it's in their best interest to leave. And now we actually have institutional, you know, self-monitored pressure to do so because we really want to get the grants back. We can't...",
