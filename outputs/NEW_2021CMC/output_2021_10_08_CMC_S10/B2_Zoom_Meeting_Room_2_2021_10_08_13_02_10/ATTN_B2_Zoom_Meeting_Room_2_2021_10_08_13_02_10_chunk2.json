And instead we should actually be using it and potentially data mining it and but there is just nothing in our community that's up to the levels of the astro databases or PDB or things of that sort for dynamics of systems. There just isn't anything. Maybe it's because dynamics is more heterogeneous and it's harder to do than for structure, I don't know.",

Do you guys feel like you get credit for group science when you're reviewed for funding and promotion?",

In our tenure guidelines it's really clear that like the order of authors, the number of authors on your publication should not be considered since in physics and the example in the comments about astronomy like it's much more common in those areas to have these large teams. So that's a lesson that we could take from that area.",

And so if there was some way to sort of get away from like numbers of papers or numbers of citations or order of your name on the paper like some genuine way to do it that's not just everybody gets credit for everything but like you can recognize excellence in a way that wasn't just indexed by numbers and author lists that was genuine that people could access and use I think that would be that would help I think.",

But now with all these databases you can click on H indices or whatever all that stuff is you know that's what people do because it's quick and easy to do. So and it and there's deep implicit biases there right you know people do this automatically and and I think this is one of those areas that's actually
