            "transcript": "Yeah, I also just want to add to what Nia just mentioned. So it is sometimes it is important maybe to only look at the substrate, the product. But I guess often times this enzymatic activity or signaling processes are so complex, so there's just no single tool that can answer all the questions. So that's why we have these in vitro method and in vivo method. Even for in vivo method for one enzyme, so you want to study the substrate input and the enzyme itself and its product, and product is affecting even like downstream enzyme or other proteins. So the nice thing is I guess it's possible to develop a sensor or method for at each step or each level and then so we cannot in the end eventually possibly we can combine all these views together and to have a more complete holistic picture of the whole process. Like for the problem I'm studying GPCR signaling, so we need to study when the ligand for GPCR is being released, time and space is important, and the GPCR itself whether it responds to it because whether the concentration is right or not. So you not only need to look at the ligand, you also need to look at the GPCR, and then once it's being activated and then its own post-translational modifications and it affects G proteins and downstream like secondary messenger effects. So all the good thing is there are people designing sensors for like each step of this process that I guess enable to to study like all of these together.",

I mean there are there are places that are trying to do that like the Allen Institute of the cell what is it the Allen Institute for Cell Science where they're just trying to integrate across scales, time scales, length scales and and generate a movie basically and you would be able to sit there and watch your favorite enzyme at work.",

            "transcript": "And I mean that was a that was a on the wish list from from last year's meeting is is that yeah like the with the messiness inherent in biological processes is like the more you constrain it in vitro or in silico, the farther away it goes from what's really happening. And then and then there's you know there's this other kind of wall that you hit in terms of like reference data and how to improve multiscale simulations and sort of bottom up simulations that are you know so simplistic that you have to get the simple thing correct to get to start to have a chance of qualitatively describing the soup. So like you know it's a it's a it's such a multi-dimensional problem that where where do you get started kind of bridging these gaps.",
