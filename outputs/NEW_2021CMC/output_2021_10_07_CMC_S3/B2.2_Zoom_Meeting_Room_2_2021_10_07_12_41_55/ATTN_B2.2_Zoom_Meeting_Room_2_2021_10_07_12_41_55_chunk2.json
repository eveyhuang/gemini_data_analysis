That's why we like generate a large piece of DNA with that piece of damage like in a test tube and then kind of like transfect it into the cell but then it gets like many many copies of that like lots of those DNA molecules get into the cell and then you would again end up with like multiple substrates.",

I also like my lab does a lot of in vitro biochemistry and we're starting to think about how you look at our favorite enzymes in in the cell and you know we it seems like a lot of the in-cell enzymology techniques that are out there I think as maybe Stephanie pointed out first it's really focused on the products like what are the enzymes making can you detect the formation of a product in space and time and that's the information a lot of people are after from a cell biology point of view but like you know our lab we're largely interested in you know when this thing is happening or a particular product is forming in the cell at a particular space and time what does the enzyme look like how is its conformation changing is that information we care about and I kind of want to pose that question to the group that do we care actually is this an enzyme-centric discussion or is it a product-centric discussion I I'm I don't care either way I just think it's an interesting thing to",

      "transcript": "Yeah and I guess like sort of what I would be curious to know from other people is what would you want to know about your enzyme in in the context of this discussion your favorite enzyme let's say you're studying a DNA repair enzyme or we study kinases and phosphatases um like I kind of want to know what it looks like you know what conformation it's in when it's bound to these proteins in the cell and how that dictates its enzyme activity but I also want to know what this enzyme is acting on because in the case of the enzymes we study they're relatively promiscuous they don't just make one product but they phosphorylate a dozen proteins or something so everyone's system is different so I'm just curious where we all stand and whether we have a common set of things we want to learn about enzymes you know in the cell or not.",

I think now people make the single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy and also have the high photon based single atom imaging inside cells. For to answer your question about the enzyme I'm very big fan of the enzyme activity but I also in another different angle was very interested in a very fundamental question about protein folding. So it's always takes like picosecond to nanosecond it's very quick dynamics and the folding and denaturing in in the cell environment that's something very interesting too.",
