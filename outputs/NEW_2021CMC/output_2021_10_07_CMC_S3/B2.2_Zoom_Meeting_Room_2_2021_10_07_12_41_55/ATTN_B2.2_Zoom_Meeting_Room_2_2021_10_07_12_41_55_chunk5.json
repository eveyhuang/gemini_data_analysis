And so you know so an atom scope a full atom scope of the entire cell is that's a little bit far out there for me. So I'll hedge and say okay if we could image at one micron and actually really do a very detailed inventory of what's in a one micron voxel or one micron cubed voxel you know and and actually deliver that in five to eight years and and you know compositionally detailed you would get the endogenous proteoforms that are the enzymes that information. You would collect the substrates and products present in that voxel so it would be somewhat local. And then the computational support I think there are big efforts to say well now I can layer known protein complex information onto this knowledge and and that's I'm now I'm not now I'm not sounding particularly well thought out but that's kind of anyway that's what came out Gang-Yu.",

We are almost there in some ways once we have the list right? As of course you know right talking with Romie and Zan Schulten right from Urbana of course is working on that and so this is right I mean I think it's a very nice spatial plan or spatial scale we can reach hopefully soon enough.",

So several of the fellows here heard me talking about label-free atomic scale optical imaging in among live cells with atomic resolution. I think that's far down the road but it's coming. So with that we let fellows to converge with your thought. We got about six minutes left one each. We'll start harassing Neil because he has to representing us.",

      "transcript": "Go ahead no no no go ahead. Yeah I I just I I keep coming back to what Wenjing said earlier on about really making a series of measurements that probe different aspects of an enzyme's function and then basically figuring out how to integrate them. And so like from my perspective as somebody who studies kinases and phosphatases I would want to be able to say over the course of some cellular process can I do one experiment where I measure you know subcellular localization as a function of that process another where I overlay on top of that intrinsic enzyme activity as a function of that same process right which may not necessarily be correlated because in some locale maybe the enzyme's inhibited or whatever right? And then the second thing may come from like a product-producing biosensor or something like that. And then the third thing might be mapping what it's interacting with as a function of you know space and time. And so whether that's products or other that are being formed other substrates that are being acted upon or regulatory proteins or something. If you had those three pieces of measurement over the same like sort of biological process I think you could learn an enormous amount about what that enzyme is actually doing and how it operates. And then the fourth kind of dream thing would be to be able to map onto that the conformational dynamics of the protein as a function of all these things. But and that's something as a structural biologist I would love to be able to do but you know we wear different hats in our lab. So yeah I none of those are a proposal for a specific technology but if there are four technologies that we could merge into one thing that would be like for example if I was going to pitch a project to this group that's what I would pitch and I would just pitch my favorite enzyme because it would help us out. But yeah that's",
