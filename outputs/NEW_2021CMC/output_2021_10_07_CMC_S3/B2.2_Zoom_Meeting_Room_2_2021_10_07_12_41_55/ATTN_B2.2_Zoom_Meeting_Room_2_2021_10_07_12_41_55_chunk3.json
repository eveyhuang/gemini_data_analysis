      "transcript": "Yeah I also just want to add to what Nia just mentioned. So it is sometimes it is important maybe to only look at the substrate, the product. But I guess often times that this enzymatic activity or signaling processes and are so complex. So there's just no single tool that can answer all the questions. So that's why we have these in vitro method and in vivo method. Even for in vivo method for one enzyme, so you want to study the substrate input and the enzyme itself and its product, and product is affecting even like downstream like enzyme or other proteins. So the nice thing is I guess we it's possible to develop a sensor or method for at each step or each level and then so we cannot it's in the end eventually possibly we can like combine all these views together and to have a more complete holistic picture of the whole process. Like for the problem I'm studying GPCR signaling, so we need to study when the ligand for GPCR is being released, time and space is important, and the GPCR itself whether it responds to it because the whether the concentration is right or not. So you not only need to look at the ligand, you also need to look at the GPCR. And then once it's being activated and then its own post-translational modifications and it affects G proteins and downstream like secondary messenger effects. So all of the good thing is there there are people designing sensors for like each step of this process that I guess enable to to study like all of these together.",

And then and then there's, you know, there's this other kind of wall that you hit in terms of like reference data and how to improve multiscale simulations and sort of bottom-up simulations that are you know so simplistic that you have to get the simple thing correct to get to start to have a chance of qualitatively describing the soup.

I'm not sure whether it has been successful yet but it shows that it can model all the potential organelle inside and including enzyme in the enzyme level too. But that's a big dream.",

You know that that's that just seems so old school and and not transformative right but but there's so much to be done in interpreting what's going on in the biochemistry by doing good kinetics.

We we address some problem in tissue regeneration that takes like you know two weeks for a zebrafish to regenerate an organ. And so for us time scale are of order of several hours, right? So and for that is you know this biosensor in which a phosphorylation event causes a changes in protein localization is good enough. You know we don't need picosecond resolution to look at conformational change. However what is interesting I mean we have been quite lucky that we have been able to do a lot with biosensor that other people have made and we just put them in our animals and study them but when we have tried to make some it's very hard. So I'm wondering if maybe a more practical goal where you know the cell biologist, developmental biologist like me could come together with computational biology where I don't really understand much about protein structures and but it seems there has been a lot of progress in computational models. So I'm wondering if we could rationally design if I could get together with my computational biologist friends and kind of design five sensors that are likely to work if I care about kinase X and then I can put them because if I want to put them in a zebrafish you know it takes nine months to generate a transgenic so I cannot screen I cannot put 300 in there.",
