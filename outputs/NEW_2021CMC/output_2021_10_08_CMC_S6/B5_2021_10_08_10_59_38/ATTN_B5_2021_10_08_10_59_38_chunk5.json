      "transcript": "when I was in grad school I studied gene expression stochastic or you know gene expression things like that and I I sort of like kind of lost faith that we were ever going to be able to understand what's happening at the scale of the cell if I just know all the different like gene expression levels of all the genes in the cell. And so as a postdoc I started moving to like organelle biogenesis things that are higher scale. And now we're trying to kind of connect these things and it's yeah that's where we're having you know real intellectual challenges because everything's variable on both scales. They obviously talk to each other and how these things map on to things like how big the cell is or how fast they grow it's very hard to intuit from a bottom up kind of model. So yeah that's the that's the kind of challenge we're trying to grapple with with the machine learning.",

Um and I think that falls into we have a lot of data but like you know do we have enough replicates? And so I feel like often times with these problems we would like to use them more but I think like other people have been saying it's just you know how can this be best like best applied. So how do you know without having this expertise like which one is which approach might be best and how do we actually use it in a meaningful way? Because I yeah I feel like with a lot of these I don't even know where to get started. But I think it's clearly powerful it's just you know do we have I think often we were trying I had a student trying to machine learn something from our data and it was basically like we don't have enough data. So it's like how much data do we even need you know to even begin the to apply because I think small data sets you know are very as people have already said are very biased and that's probably a problem. So I think that's kind of been from an experimental standpoint some of the hesitations we have when trying to even jump in.",

Um but um you know it's just like I think even from an experimental standpoint when we're saying what fields could benefit or what um you know what is the data I think part of that is like how much data do you do we need to get to even meaningfully use this? Like I don't have a feel for that still other than like is it just the answer is I need to go get thousands of patient samples and like is it just thousands? Like I don't know. I think the answer might be yes but",

      "transcript": "Um yeah I have a lot of thoughts on this but I guess I'll I guess I'll talk a little bit about um my I guess my perspective on these questions at sort of these larger scales I think sort of related to maybe what what what Julian was talking about. Um so you know part of our work is is sort of more in the sort of mathematical biology world where a lot of the models are very large scale in the sense of like you know cellular networks so gene regulatory networks and signaling networks and in in this field a lot of the models are trying to be you know not necessarily molecularly accurate because there's everybody acknowledges that we have tons of gaps but you know more can we capture the phenomenology so you know can we capture like the you know the particular sort of circuit dynamics that are going to you know appropriately describe what's you know what's happening you know with the data and actually be able to predict you know how this cell would act under a perturbation let's say even if we can't actually capture every single pathway and every single interaction in a signaling network for example. Um and so in what I see is that there is this this real sort of um question of of forward or like what was it called like inverse versus forward modeling right so the forward model is all right you know we have a whole bunch of different papers that you know have a whole bunch of cartoons in them um with different sort of mechanistic hypotheses about what this pathway is or whatever let's start building that into a model. We'll have a whole lot of issues with you know gaps in our where we don't know the parameters or whatever but we can start to model those things. Um and maybe if we're lucky we can we can kind of compete different models like that against each other and see which ones match the data better. Um so I guess that would be sort of like a forward modeling problem but then in this field there's also been um a lot of progress in the inverse modeling I don't know about machine learning but um maybe some more sort of old-fashioned statistical inference approaches where people are doing Bayesian inference and kind of um model selection um against data and so I guess that's that actually sort of combines both right because you still have your sort of you still have your models that you start with and then you sort of compete those against the data. Um but I guess the issue is that you have such a if you have a lot of gaps in your knowledge of the system and you're still trying to capture some like fundamental properties of it then you have an issue which is that you're never going to be able to put in your space of models all the possibilities. Like you just you know there's like this universe of possible let's say like network structures that you know might be there that we don't know about yet and like you're never going to be able to capture those in all your models and so then I think there's this issue of you know this question of bias like like was brought up previously it's like well if I start you know with my best guess of what these systems are doing I'm going to have tons of gaps or I'm never going to be able to comprehensively model all the possibilities but on the other hand if I were to maybe just do a completely like sort of data-driven approach and try to have some you know these great new algorithms that are somehow going to learn those dynamics um from the data maybe they'll have their own biases which I'm not I'm no expert in that so I don't know what what those pitfalls are. But that's what I'm thinking about.",
