If we could model you know a cell at the atomic level over a long time scale would we even have the tools the data analysis tools to catch these rare events and know what to make of them and to sort of interpret them as functionally important. I think that I had not thought about that until you just said it but now I'm wondering I mean because we our intuitively we would look for these you know we would probably find all the molecules that were the same in identity and we would probably start off by just like averaging across their behavior from these all atom molecular dynamics simulations you know I don't think we would we wouldn't even intuitively think to look at the rare events and what their functional consequences are. At least I wouldn't but I'm not it's not my expertise.",

So if if you know you don't have to evaluate all these like pairwise interactions if it's just an analytical form and you know exactly well I don't know if it will be an analytical form but if it if it's much faster to evaluate the forces maybe MD can go you know much bigger and much longer time scale. So I'm wondering if I think some people are doing that in the field although I didn't really pay attention. But for MD I I would say force field is always one of the big issues that limit the accuracy.",

And I'm I don't know what other examples there might be but I suspect that there are some. And I also was kind of thinking along the lines of what Lu said in that well maybe machine learning could could generate a force field or or some kind of model that would better represent metal binding sites but the current problem is that most of the metal binding sites that we see in the PDB are from crystal structures of well folded proteins and I think the frontier well I I don't I mean maybe I'm biased but I think that there's a frontier on trying to understand the metal binding sites that are present in the non-folded proteins or these intrinsically disordered proteins or so basically when the protein's folding around the metal ion or the metal ion changes the protein structure that data doesn't exist and so we would need the data first to get the machine learning so I think there we need physics based approaches I mean like and maybe knowledge based approaches as well and data lots and lots of data.
