So maybe two people sort of working together. So the reporter will be the person who goes and reports back out and oh good Nathan. And the scribe will be the person you know really sort of taking all the notes about what people are saying and we will have time at the end we'll be sure to set aside time after we have our fantastic discussion we'll set aside time to sort of review what we talked about to help the reporter report back out in sort of a comprehensive way is what I would say. I mean at least I've found that helpful for for for the sessions. So",

So I'm going to use this really cool timer trick where we start the clock and then at the end the last two digits are going to give us a number and whoever's closest to that number will be the scribe and then we'll do it again and that person will be the reporter. And so if you could please into the chat which we have up and going already which is a nice feature hopefully you guys are all accustomed to using that with Zoom if you could please each enter
