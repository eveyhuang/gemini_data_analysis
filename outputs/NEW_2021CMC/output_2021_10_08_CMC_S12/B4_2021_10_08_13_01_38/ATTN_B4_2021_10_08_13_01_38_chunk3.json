      "transcript": "Okay. And I think I mean the important point is that there's sort of like two two different approaches that I think Stephen kind of captured in his comment pretty well but you can take sort of a you can isolate certain certain cells in some ways and you can prep a sample differently and like yes I think the techniques are getting better in terms of multi-cell bottom up proteomics where you essentially take that mixture and digest it see what's all there and and go down all the way to maybe single cell levels if there's multiplexing techniques now where you can kind of barcode individual cells and then you can mix them all together so you increase essentially the the the sample amount but you can use the barcodes like isotope tags to kind of de-convolute how much of of every peptide was in each individual sample. So that's on the one hand but then if you yeah to do the spatial resolution I think you were really also limited I think in terms of like what the techniques are so with with MALDI ionization then it's really about like how large the laser size is to kind of ionize different regions or I think there's some some interesting sort of nano ESI based techniques on surfaces where you can kind of digest little droplets on on tissue preparations for example but again still I think in the micron range so like nowhere near single cell resolution or subcellular resolution.",

      "transcript": "But even with like single cell sequencing technologies you lose all spatial information like you know especially like subcellular localization as well like this all was in the cell we don't know where within the cell or if you have a population of cells we found these cells but we don't know like where they were on the you know in the tissue or wherever they originated from. So so maybe like we can break it down into like you know if we want to come up with some like single molecule or single cell proteomics maybe it's okay that we lose the spatial resolution because we don't we don't really have that with these other technologies that we're trying to like strive for in terms of the the sequencing.",

      "transcript": "If I could just interject with DNA sequencing in fact they have gotten single a single cell you know for example you take an egg and a sperm and it reproduces and if there's either 16 or 32 cells you then can take out a cell without harming the rest of it you can actually sequence it. Sunny Xie in China did this and you can see that you know this cell is or is not okay in terms of the mutation and then continue to grow that up. So that's just a by comparison.",

So maybe like instead of trying to define the entire proteome you want to know what kind of proteome actually has a spatial component to it like if you can work on a larger model system or larger cell or whatever to like better focus how you then re-miniaturize.",
