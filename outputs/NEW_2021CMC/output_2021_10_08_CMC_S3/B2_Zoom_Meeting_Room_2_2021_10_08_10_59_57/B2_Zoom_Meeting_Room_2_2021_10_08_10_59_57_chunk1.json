I study stem cells in the tip of the fruit fly testis and in the mouse testis. So I think about cells inside of a tissue all the time and how they're dealing with their neighbors and how we might probe that better. So I'm really excited about our topic. And my plan is to have a have you guys each put a number between 0 and 99 into the chat right now. And I will pick a random number from my cell phone and that will be our reporter. And then if you guys like, we can also have a separate person that could be the scribe. Do you want the reporter and scribe to be the same person or do you want separate people? Raise your hand if you want the same person. Okay, raise your hand if you want separate people. Okay, good. I see some votes for separate. Okay, so then we'll first pick a reporter and then we'll pick a scribe. All right, and I got to work my stopwatch for a sec. Did everybody put a number in? Okay. The number is 85. So that means Taras, is that right?",

Does that sound okay to you guys? Yes. Yes. Okay. So I'll set a stopwatch for that. And I'll also be kind of being keenly aware of whether everybody gets a chance to participate. So if you are a quick talker, make sure you make space for other people. And if you're a slow to jump in talker, make sure you get space because we really want everyone to feel comfortable and represented.
