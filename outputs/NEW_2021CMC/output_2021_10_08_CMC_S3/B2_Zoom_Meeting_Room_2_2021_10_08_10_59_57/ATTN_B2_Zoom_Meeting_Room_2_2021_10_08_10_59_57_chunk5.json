You just see that the mass is changing within places in the cell and you know and then because it's completely label-free you can couple to that anything you want that has a label. So obviously you can do multiple modalities if if you build an instrument that allows you to do it or you have to shuffle between instruments but yes.",

Yes you know is in the tens of nano of sorry probably around 1 to 10 micrometers I want to say you know it's it's sub probably less than I don't I don't actually I'm not the technical person on that we just look at stuff but I want to say you know it's you can see within a cell things moving around but again 1 to 10 microns you are not talking small things we are talking you know.",
