I think there's examples of different proteins doing this, but I think the sort of like physical chemical principles that that sort of govern this are still very much very much unknown. I don't know if that is something where like, yeah, computational chemistry or a merge of like data like assembling more data on what other example proteins and membrane properties and some computational modeling would help.",

And I know that like you simply change the ratio of like one thing or try another lipid or different combinations and you can get single bilayer, you can get where they all look like almost myelinated. It just changes so many outcomes. And it's kind of curious how how that happens. And that that's even without putting your protein in, that's just pure lipid.",

      "transcript": "So there's yeah. And I know like tomography, EM has really been especially the new like tomography cryo like the cryo stuff has really been interesting in being able to get into like very to kind of get at these things unperturbed because the problem is like once you put a probe in, you've perturbed it. And that's something that we've always had a challenge with our sensors. An example of a really specialized type is even the cristae in the in the matrix of sorry, even the cristae in a mitochondrion, sorry, that delineates the matrix from the inner membrane space. In order to keep that high proton gradient to keep to keep the ATP synthase going, they you you create like a little invagination and that's all that proton gets pumped in a really small space and so that's how you get that high local concentration of it. And that you know, and that's a very specialized shape of the lipid or membrane, I should say, not lipid, shape of a membrane. And it was tomography that actually was able to get a lot of this get a lot of this out without perturbing and then like you know the the ETC, the different organizations of the complex, the different complexes and stuff.",

And uh if getting so getting structural information that way which leads to a very clear gradient, you know, reason to have a gradient like you said, that's uh so again that's an interesting point, right? That the very local structure, well not local, but somewhat local structure of the membrane can really impart impart function, right?",

It's it's actually something that I realized yeah we don't we don't know how to do it so cleanly because any probe will perturb the system. Um and they are more or less specific anyway. Uh and it may or may not go uh to the right place anyway. I mean there's a lot
