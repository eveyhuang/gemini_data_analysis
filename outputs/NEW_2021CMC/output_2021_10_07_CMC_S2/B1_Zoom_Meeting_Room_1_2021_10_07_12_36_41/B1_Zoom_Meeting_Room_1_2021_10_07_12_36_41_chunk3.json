I mean they might they might not I don't know and what do we know in terms of measurements across membranes or of membranes even yet and what do we not like by almost by defining what we know we can kind of figure out where the holes are. Maybe? I don't know.",

So it's possible I think that the membrane the the scale of the diffusion of the membrane diffusion can vary depending on what cell function is involved.",

            "transcript": "Yeah I mean has to be directed by the cell but but what I mean what drives that I think it's it's unclear right but there are a couple of examples like for example I think Adam Cohen's recent paper showing you know there is a collective large scale lipid flow right and I forgot maybe this was a private conversation with someone I forgot but that person mentioned that in plant cells they have also observed that during certain like division or something the cell the membrane would have like their hypothesis the membrane would have a very large scale of directed flow. And so I think it seems reasonable that in some cell function like like dividing for example it seems reasonable to suspect that the cells the cell membrane would have some collective motion together. But then in some other you know like localized compartmentalized cell signaling then those kind of large scale cell you know membrane flow may not be very effective but rather they want to have localized organized membrane domains and compartments that helps to facilitate you know the the receptor signaling at a local level so I think it might it might vary depending on what cell functions are involved but but we don't know you know why I mean how does the cell know what what what mechanisms to to use and to trigger trigger this right?",

I mean is that a feasible do people I'm not familiar as much with synthetic biology but is that something that people have used or could leverage to to facilitate these sort of coordinated protein complexes?",

            "transcript": "I mean I'll maybe address I mean that's an that's a really key point I think in sort of the bigger theme that I that I took away from this is sort of like how do you so these are all really complex processes we're kind of describing right so like is maybe like one way to study it of course would be to to simplify it and to to take away some complexity and then have a really controlled system where we you organize different different membrane regions or some of these I don't know phase phase separated parts or membrane identities and so forth. And so from from the protein side yes I mean different proteins are known to associate with the different or localized to different regions of the the membrane. And you could I mean you could engineer proteins or complexes to stick to different membrane regions maybe on there to localize them and kind of mimic those processes but then again that's a very yeah it's a very reductionist approach of course. The other point maybe to raise too is from the detection side I remember a conversation we had last year I think maybe with at a similar style or topic about in sort of probes to even study different membrane properties and I think there's I mean there's a lot of advances made like different environmental sensitive fluorophores that that exist but they're still I think from what I understand they're relatively crude and sort of like very low resolution that we have an have an understanding of different membrane properties so there's I think a lot of room still to refine those.",

So do synthetic biologists ever try to redo their membranes like you try to give a cell a new membrane? I have no idea. Maybe that anyway okay that's my role asking stupid questions okay.",

And also if from my perspective if you would like to engineer a consortium then making a some kind of this loose structure of the cell membrane help the cell cell mass transfer. And there are some ways to do this there are some engineered proteins they can help the cell membrane to essentially have more holes and that allows for the effective passage of some selective or selected metabolites or compounds with our interest. And I'm not sure if there's anything else Alex can add because he's also a synthetic biologist.",

There are definitely people who are trying to engineer the membrane for cell-cell communication and also secreting different components. So so there's there are tools that people are developing there. In terms of enzyme assembly it may be hard to to program that well especially kind of to get it into the membrane in a controllable way but it's something you could work towards.",
