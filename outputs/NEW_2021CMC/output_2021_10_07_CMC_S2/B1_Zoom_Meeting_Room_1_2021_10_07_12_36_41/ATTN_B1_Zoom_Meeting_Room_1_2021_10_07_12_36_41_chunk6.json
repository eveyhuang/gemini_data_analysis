For example, like endosomes, right? The lipid composition of the endosome have really big impact on, you know, what ions would go in, what enzymes would be activated, for example, at what time. So that's, you know, in a way I think the membrane composition might be some kind of clock, I guess, that times the the, you know, the the progress, I would say, of those reactions and changes of the organelles inside the cell.",

I mean, people are studying them but I'm guessing most people when they think of membrane think of the plasma membrane, right? So is it but is it I don't know what the state of the art is for, you know, looking at people who study membranes, is the are the vesicular membranes, you know, now overpowering the plasma membrane or not really?

      "transcript": "No, it's I'll just make this very quick. I mean one one thing that's challenging is isolation, right? So we can get the we can get to the plasma membrane, that's why it's been studied. We can get to we can isolate microsomes, we can isolate exosomes, like extracellular things, but but having specificity is very challenging. And that's limited also I think some of these questions that you just brought up with how how vesicles get dynamically remodeled or or changed in composition with yeah, with with time or even even statically. So if we had ways to that's like a need to to maybe address how to how to label some vesicles in a perturbed way or maybe not better non-perturbed and isolate it through other things than just differential centrifugation or gradient centrifugation, that would be awesome.",

      "transcript": "Yeah, and there is there anything better than NTA? So nanoparticle tracking analysis is a way to get like concentration of vesicles, right, in a solution. I mean, that's pretty limited. I mean, you can do it, but that's limited by the to a certain concentration range. I mean, so so that's I mean as a chemist, right, that's another thing you'd like to know like, well, how many vesicles do I have, right? And okay, so there's not that many methods there either. But yeah, the isolation is another big pain, right? That's another roadblock. So we think I think we have about five more minutes for our discussion. Oh boy. And then, and then we have to help Lulu put together our one slide. So, um, okay, are there other points people want to make about problems that need to be overcome, areas of inquiry that are understudied, connections between things we've talked about? Like we haven't mentioned too much about the mechanical nature of membranes. Um, but that's another right, you could have, you know, maybe a similar chemical composition over some length scale, but the mechanical properties might be different depending on how, you know, I guess I never think about lipids being cross-linked, but maybe they are. Certainly it's easier to think about proteins being cross-linked. So any other thoughts?",

Is that really the only way? And I I don't again, I don't have the answers to that to that question, but um, it seems like even when we're trying to understand what's going on with membrane, we actually glaze over 95% of what's going on with the membrane.

So it's like, okay, let's get homogeneous media and saying that you at a scale that's high, you know, large enough that, you know, the details don't really matter anymore. You can talk about an average property of But I I agree. For example, basically endocytosis is just, I mean, it's breaking the these endocytosis, exocytosis, we still do that, but we know it's not it's not okay because just the thickness of the membrane is 5 nanometers and the shapes we're looking at are 50 nanometer in diameter, right? So it's still, you know, it's like 10% and and 50 nanometer is the largest, right? So we kind
