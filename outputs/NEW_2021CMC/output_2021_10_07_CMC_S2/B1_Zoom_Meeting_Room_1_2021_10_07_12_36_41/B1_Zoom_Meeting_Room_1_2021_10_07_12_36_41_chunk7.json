If it if it's actually true then people maybe not have been studying that. Okay so um okay so Yan I'm going down my list here so Yan you're next.

That means that for example if you have cell population some cells may behave better or worse than others and how do we take this into account is a big challenge for us. And I mean for for um membrane um for for transportation through membrane for example extracellular space concentration is always uniform so to speak but intracellularly the concentration may not be the same between different cells and that is a big problem.",
