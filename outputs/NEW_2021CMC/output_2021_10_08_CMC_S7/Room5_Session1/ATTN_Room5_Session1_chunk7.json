You know like do we you know where there's some questions where and some methods where everything is sort of very well defined and then other places where there's still a lot more to discover. Did you want to say anything more on that Julian?",

      "transcript": "That that that's right and it's I think it relates also to the the the tidiness and cleanliness of the data and the concepts and the assumptions that are behind the the algorithms. To some extent I think it kind of relates to Sandy's question maybe a little remotely but it's you know I think where it works well I always think about the the alpha fold structures and all that stuff. The problem is super well defined and super well annotated, super well characterized. It's very clear what the output needs to be and what what the inputs are. And so it works really well it worked well relatively well so far because it's very well defined I think and the question is very clear. And so I think they started really with the question here. And I've seen other machine learning in completely different fields I mean it could be in you know image reconstruction or there's someone in the in the lab where I am is looking at some machine learning that people developed to pick up FRET data you know single particle FRET data and absolutely fails miserably on that dataset because probably the it's not so well defined what are the conditions that the that the training datasets were taken on and and so even the the authors cannot really answer these these guys' you know the student's question because it's they don't know what's going on and from my point of view it's because the the the data are not well defined and and and even though the question was well well defined here.",

I'm I'm saying I mean if if we were asked the question is there room for physics based and knowledge based models and our and one of our answers is let's focus on on databases to me that's that's actually answering that that there isn't as much room for the other. So I was trying to push Catherine to to saying is is that what you're saying or is there room for both? That sorry that that was my interjection.",

Um I know that that's a problem in my field and so um there's a lot of misinformation in in science um in specific fields but anyway um I'm just I'm noticing that that uh the quality of the data and the consistency with how it's presented or logged is a problem and I don't think it's a problem that's limited to AI or machine learning it sounds like it's a problem for the way that we understand biology or chemistry. So I don't see it as like a mutually exclusive thing. No it's everywhere. I'm only an experimentalist.",

Um we we've started a collaboration like that recently and it's been fantastic. I mean I don't I wouldn't say that we've had any big wins yet but you know everything is like each lab's directions are being informed by you know uh so the baby steps you know from from each group and I think it
