Rigoberto, what do you think about the possibility I'm seeking your advice here about the possibility to go around, have everybody sort of give their top thoughts about the topic generally, so everybody sort of says something and then we can go in and do a deeper dive maybe where we hear that there's synergy from folks.",

One thing that could help with that is since everyone is on a notes field, if you wrote down a sentence or a phrase or a catchall for what's going to be the the thing you're going to point out, maybe just write that down also or and that will make it easier for us to to write down. Sometimes we ask people to write a sentence in in the real meeting, but I think it can be a little bit looser than that but having a catchall for that would be helpful so that we can start to sort it.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, so I think I mean to the first point, one of the I guess one of the questions that I have is in any implementation of machine learning, it seems like the the data, the quality of the data impact kind of how well the algorithms can be developed, whether it's a training a training data set, whether it's an experimental data set. And it's it's interesting, my my background being in physics and then kind of moving more recently to biology, kind of some of the standards in biology, especially when using living animals, standards for biological replicates, transparency in in kind of rigor of using and and kind of describing error and making data open source that I think are great and perhaps not as strictly enforced in in other fields that that don't work with living systems. So I'm curious about, yeah, kind of like machine learning approaches in in what fields would be in what fields they would be most useful and perhaps it's the fields in which there is more data to access in which that data is kind of clearly presented as multiple replicates and and in which the annotation and the way that the data is archived is is kind of clearly made such that it could be consolidated for for machine learning. It's not an area that I do much active research in but it's certainly something that I've thought about when when trying to pull machine learning into some of the work that we do. That's great.

            "transcript": "We just worked recently with a group in the statistics department to develop some machine learning model for a hydrogen bonding system that we're interested in. So definitely I I think the promise of machine learning is that we can do way more things than we can do previously. So and then the issue there I I find is the data definitely. And then how we provide the data, how accurate are the data and how we train the model. It's really I mean the limitation of machine learning is really how you teach it. It will it will come out as that model that you want which is a little bit annoying because if the data itself was only limited in one region of the phase space for example, the prediction would be more accurate in that phase space instead of the overall you know the real real prediction power. So that's what I find and I think it's it's really a joint force between theory and experiments to generate these good data. We like in our model we're relying on the protein data bank and we're trying to get the the top like 1% highest quality structures over there but then these are just experimental data. If there are high accuracy computational data, I think these would definitely be more useful. And we also find that if we give them data in this region of the the space we're interested in, you know the the model give us something really weird. But then just recently my student had some like they he had over a thousand data in the original space and then he generated like 10 in a new direction although we don't know which direction it is, it completely changed the machine learning model and its prediction. So that I think is a pitfall because as a user of machine learning model, we usually don't care about these stuff and then people really need to be careful about how they treat data, how they get the training data and whether they have kind of sampled the entire I don't know how you call it a space that for the prediction.",
