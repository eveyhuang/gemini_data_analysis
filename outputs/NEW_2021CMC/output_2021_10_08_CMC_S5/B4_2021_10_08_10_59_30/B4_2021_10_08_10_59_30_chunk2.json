It seems like there's a lot of study about how they move on an isolated cell, but I wonder in a tissue whether cell-cell interaction doesn't play a very significant role. And so that's just my basic question of I presume people have done these measurements but I'm completely ignorant of the field and if someone else has comments about this, I'd be interested.",

            "transcript": "Well, what I I can imagine for example is you have the EGFR, you know, the receptor of EGF and there's a fair amount of studies where for example, you can label it and watch it via a fluorescent molecule move around and you can see a certain amount of diffusion or it's not moving, whatever. And then those are measurements on an isolated cell. Have people done it on tissues and are the results similar? And and for example, the rate of EGF conformational changes that when an EGF molecule comes in, you know, it has a certain rate constant for example to get through the membrane. Is that what is it in real life, so to speak? And I I just don't know.",

I'm like a chemical biologist and so we work with immortalized cell lines and even with those when you dilute them too much, like they die. Like there's some magical thing in quorum sensing or whatever you want to call it where the cells need many other cells to be nearby or else they totally change and they get sickly. And so I imagine the same thing has to be true with tissues and there it's not even it's going to be so heterogeneous too. And I I like this word like holistic, like the holistic view of a cell and I always think or like a tissue and when you're like again as a chemical biologist like we want to get molecular information about these systems and the more molecular information you get, the like less holistic information and like your holistic view starts to like break down. And so like how is there a way that we can sort of like balance those two and like retain the sort of holistic information of of tissues or multicellular systems but get molecular information on it.",

            "transcript": "So I can kind of add to what Alexis was talking about and you know, following up. Um, you know, it's it's definitely so we're interested in cancer and we're interested in generating basically uh chemical tools where we can, you know, track in the cases of macrophages and circadian rhythms, these dynamic processes. And one of the reasons why we use reporters is because we want to be able to incorporate and recapitulate or incorporate different and multiple cell types and recapitulate these, you know, three-dimensional and even two-dimensional but multicellular environments because, you know, all of this really does matter and it does make a difference what cells are nearby, you know, what are what are the activity states of the cells that are nearby, you know, even in terms of so Alexis mentioned, you know, just the density of cells but also whether you culture the cells in two dimensions versus three dimensions, right? You can have the same exact cell type but you have, you know, wildly different characteristics in terms of, you know, what's being expressed, what's being secreted, etc. Um, and the last thing I want to bring up because I I already feel like I've talked for a little bit here, um, is is also just the the characteristics of the environment, things like stiffness, right? Because one of the things that that came up are, you know, how do we define these tissue units and cellular neighborhoods and are they different in different organs? They're absolutely different in different organs because, you know, some organs are more homogeneous, others are more heterogeneous, um, and and the physical characteristics of different organs is also different. So, you know, being able to recapitulate all those things is extremely difficult and I and I'm interested to hear from, you know, the physical tool people about how we can get more out of, you know, these systems because at this stage, you know, it's it's hard to do period.",

            "transcript": "So I'll chip in a little bit um because I agree with everything you said Michelle. Um and I think the complexity is what makes it so hard to understand, right? Which uh which what is playing a role, right? And probably all of them are and there's a collective, right, almost decision making that the cells are doing kind of like incorporating all those signals from the environment but which one is more important and how each of them individually is guiding, right, a certain a certain fate or a certain process. And I think for that a lot of the what motivates us is to make like synthetic ECMs, right? So being able to make a synthetic environment and that environment uh really takes under consideration every time a certain feature. If it's stiffness, but it's not just stiffness, it's also architecture that are obviously very related to how the the the the ECM is also structured uh in terms of assembly. Is it fibrillar? Is it bundling? Is it a network? Is it heterogeneous? Is it homogeneous? Do we care? Does the cell care? And maybe every cell cares about a certain a different one, right? We have different tissues. And then how the cells are really incorporating all those inputs. Um and another really um complexity with this or how to interpret those results is the dynamics, right? Uh the multiple processes, multiple things that are changing all the time on different length scales and different time scales. Uh the the environment is changing affecting the cell, the cell is remodeling back the environment and that environment is changing again, right? So I think A, synthetic materials have um have some ability to answer some of those questions by decoupling each factor. Um but uh some of the needs that we have um are imaging, right? So being able to um really uh unravel what's going on on on all scales from the nano scale all the way up as well as analytics, right? How do you get and doing that all on live cells ideally. Uh how do you get um and get all that information and all that different",
