But people were looking at the diffusion, just diffusion in the cytoplasm of particles under in yeast cells grown at different temperatures, right? And Einstein-Boltzmann would say that that should cause diffusion to change in a temperature-dependent way, but they didn't see that. It looked like the diffusion remained constant across increasing temperature scales. And that's how they ended up doing a screen and finding that look, trehalose production goes through the roof
