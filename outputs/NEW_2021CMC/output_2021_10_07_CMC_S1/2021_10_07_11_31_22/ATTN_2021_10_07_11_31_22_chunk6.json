      "transcript": "Yeah I think if you can generate a contrast between kind of a steady state non-equilibrium state that we observe in cells, living cells, and a kind of more thermodynamically equilibrium state that Joshua mentioned, if you can generate a contrast for example you mentioned that he measured size distributions of such such aggregates or liquid droplets essentially. If you can do that in a living cell and then you can basically kill the cell and deplete the ATP and see how thermodynamically things are now changing, maybe the droplets are now coalescing into larger droplets, how that changes. And that would be pretty cool if you can generate this contrast. What what does the non-equilibrium steady state where everything is moving, you have molecular motors kind of zooming through it, probably kind of pushing things apart, while if you don't have that anymore, how how do things change? That would be pretty cool.",

      "transcript": "So they've tried to do this in yeast. There's a couple paper, Carsten Weiss lab and Simon Alberti, they had differing opinions on what was driving this because there's pH changes and then there's ATP depletion during like glucose starvation. And they said that the whole cytosol becomes glass-like, just that everything, just all diffusion slows as you drop ATP in the cell. Again, whether that's conserved, exactly what was driving it, it was unclear. One paper was saying it's pH changes, other was saying it's the ATP drop. But there it seems like it's not just changing the condensates but that everything becomes just like frozen kind of if you get...",

But yeah I mean it does seem like there are these enzymes that also condensate and whether it's related to the metabolic activity I think that's still unclear but that has been proposed I guess.",
