So azide and alkyne labels, but they have a vibrational mode in a region of the infrared where nothing absorbs. So we can use them to monitor dynamics in in cells. And this could also be useful for NMR. Also, you know, heavy isotopes have a unique vibrational mode. So if you feed a cell glucose for example, you can monitor incorporation of the C13 label. So I think these kind of approaches could be very complementary to mass spectrometry approaches that have been well developed.",

So you can't this has been used to monitor, you know, well I used it for protein folding. So I would look at differences in folding in different parts of a protein backbone, but it can also be used to monitor it just is sensitive to environmental changes. So you can look at binding for example, environmental changes in the polarity of the environments by just putting a probe in, things like that. So and and what's nice is we can actually do experiments in vivo in the infrared. I'm just like selling this. So",
