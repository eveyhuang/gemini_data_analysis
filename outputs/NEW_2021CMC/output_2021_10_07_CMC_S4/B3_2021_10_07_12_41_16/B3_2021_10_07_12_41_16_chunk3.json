Is that kind of the picture that people have in the field of of how viruses even arise because that is kind of an origin of compartmentalization question.",

So I think you know a lot of times it's like we see signals are they're on or we start with the low hanging fruit but I think more and more we've been thinking about is it really the subtle changes that are dictating things rather than focusing on the big on off. So I think that kind of plays into some of this.",

So are those metabolite changes like how much is needed and also how fast are those?",

            "transcript": "So the changes are subtle the the changes in concentration are are are in the the micromolar but they're specific they're highly specific though. So they at least in the case of retroviruses and retroviruses we're lucky because there's so much research and we know so much about them. But they're highly specific it's not it's not an unregulated process so it's clear that that the virus has evolved to recognize those specific metabolites. That's the view that there is no well I'm using the word evolution but I mean it's adapted to to recognize those those metabolites as a signaling element. Now actually I'm talking about lentiviruses and if you compare the lentiviruses are the ones that need to get into the nucleus but if you look at a retrovirus which can infect a cell that doesn't have doesn't need to go into the nucleus they don't they don't use those metabolites. So so yeah I mean it's like kind of like an imprint of a cell if you want and at a specific time frame.",
