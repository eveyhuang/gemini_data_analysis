      "transcript": "Yeah I can even throw another complication in all that which is I have at least some reason to believe that there's a lot of kinetic traps in the cell that promote a lot of this organization right? So it's not even easy to see from just free energies and thermodynamics it's sort of it depends on where you are and the chemical affinities for different molecules for each other and how that sort of helps these length scales be where they are. I think that",

      "timestamp": "01:03-01:23",
      "transcript": "Well I think that begs the question of what consists a compartment. Is it the length scale of it or is it dynamic of it or like it's stable for enough time where it can actually execute a certain function for a certain amount of time or it's the length scale of organization that consists a compartment or is it both?",

      "speaker": "Martin Gruebele",
      "timestamp": "01:23-01:58",
      "transcript": "Right. Well and it's probably both and not only that it probably depends on what that compartment's doing right? There could be a compartment that needs to be around for 10 minutes to actually get the job done that it's supposed to do. There could be something else that needs to be around for 10 microseconds to do the thing that it needs to do. And I would say in their own right both of these things could be considered compartmentalization for different tasks that are on different time scales. Lydia I mean you do work on protein polymer interaction so what do you think about this issue of actually assisting cell compartmentalization or modifying it beyond what's natural by using polymers?",

      "transcript": "Yeah and I think I guess you were trying to bring me in when Ronit and Allie were talking about their artificial aspects there and I also am wondering and this might relate to some of the discussion tomorrow is also okay if we're trying to make some artificial environments to create these artificial cells artificial compartmentalization like what role does the surroundings of our artificial cell play as well external cues too and I also like Shankar's point of the kinetic traps and what we're trying to define as what is a compartment because even these prompts and questions about diffusion I was thinking of not just the diffusion of the compartments themselves but the diffusion of the small molecules that make up those compartments and the gradients so I think compartmentalization even goes smaller than that of the gradients and local concentrations below that and the kinetics of producing those small molecules too so",

      "transcript": "I mean I actually suspect that you know there is of course a huge group of biologists who are trying to make synthetic organisms right like building cells out of vesicles and then putting things in them and I think whenever when I listen to the talks there I think what's often missed is that you need to have exactly that kind of time and space dependent temporal organization and that often doesn't exist in these systems they are pretty static still and then people sort of wonder why isn't this thing alive. That's because this whole network of time scales and length scales is basically missing from the equation right now.",

      "timestamp": "03:35-04:08",
      "transcript": "Although I think another thing that is related to this is the difference between self-assembled systems and self-organized systems right a self-assembled system is something that's assembled at equilibrium and is dead basically right like a virus a self-organized system is one where there's energy running through it and that's that's an alive system and many of these things that we're talking about are self-assembled systems and so the need for that continued energy input is maybe one of the things that's missing in many of these attempts.",
