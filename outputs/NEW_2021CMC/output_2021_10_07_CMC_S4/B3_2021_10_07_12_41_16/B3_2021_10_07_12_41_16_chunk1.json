But it's what is the master regulator? Is there something that's kind of keeping all these in check or and if we think about crosstalk, I maybe I can use that analogy, what's the language they're using and what are the rules of that language that synchronizes this crosstalk? That's something I'm always thinking about. Is it the cytoskeleton? Is it the metabolites? Is it just the temperature of the membrane fluidity? Is there a master regulator that's that's maybe governs that whole synchrony throughout the cell? So that's that's something I'm always thinking about.",
