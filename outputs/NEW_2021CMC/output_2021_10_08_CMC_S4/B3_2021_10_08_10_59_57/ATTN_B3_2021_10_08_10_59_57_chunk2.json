We're stumbled upon something I'm trying to even understand whether it's a phase separation or but one question I have, how many phases or how do we know what one phase is different than another? What like how many phases and how do we define that? And what distinguishes one phase from another? Are there any classifications in the field? We talk about",

      "transcript": "I think so I would go first too so I can focus on the writing as well. And also because that's exactly what what we're thinking about. So what we I think starting to see or going to start seeing is that there is so much complexity in this whole phase separation field. It's not just a liquid and a liquid. So what we're thinking about is how do complex multi-phase assemblies arise from from complex systems that you have in the cell as compared to your simple reconstitution systems where you have maybe one, two, three components but in the cell you have dozens. So there are certainly many phases. You can think about material properties I would say. You can have several liquid phases that that coexist but that have different composition and are therefore different phases. But they can also have different material properties like more gel-like, more glass-like or liquid-like. Maybe at some point it transitions into a stable aggregate then the question is is that still what we're talking about or do we not care about that because it is a stable assembly and there are no dynamics for example.",

So if you have a biomolecular condensate that's involved in RNA biochemistry versus one that's involved in metabolism or different cellular processes like what if you look at those sequences what about them causes them to to phase separate from one another or to demix into distinct states. I feel like understanding those rules will be important moving forward.",

I know that like in vitro you can make them but in vivo do we find condensates that don't have nucleic acids or are they kind of a universal in vivo? And again I think this multivalency it makes sense they're these super repetitive low information and so it makes sense that they would be in there but are there non-nucleic acid phase separated",
