So I guess if we had a technology or some some global infrastructure for doing realistic co-cultures or 3D interactions that would be a great tool to have.",

      "transcript": "I was thinking about yeah like mini organoids and how they're like super hot right now but like how accurate are they? I feel like they're pretty homogeneous in terms of like what cell types are in there. And like one of my colleagues his whole thing is he makes these like mini brains and they like sent some up to space recently to see like what happens to the brain when you go to space. But they but they start from like you know one particular cell type and then grow these organoids and I I feel like that can't be super accurate. And then this is totally like random but it it made me think like what Alison was mentioning earlier about like when the cells let off the metabolites can we like you know follow them and where did that molecule come from. But same with the ECM right? Don't the cells generate those molecule macromolecules and then like did this cell you know send out something and then did it go really far away and generate part of the ECM over there or does it stay like localized around that cell? Is there a way to like tag them to kind of see like you know in this tissue this cell generated this like these pieces of ECM that went wherever is it like totally mixed or or yeah is it like localized near the the cell that it originated from?",

      "transcript": "Yeah building off of that I mean our dream as synthetic chemists is kind of to be able to do to have that kit that Lydia wants to buy right and Alison just mentioned right like to to to be able to have like multiple tubes right and then it was like okay you want this stiffness with this architecture with this biochemical motif with this diffusional signals so then this is the protocol and then you take a little bit of that this this this and you mix it and you have your pre-formed design right. So this is what we're aspiring to do we're not there yet but but we have made some progress into at least connecting you know the structure to the mechanics which is something that not necessarily has been done and with most people just use regular networks and not necessarily think about the the the architecture of that network that also obviously relates to the mechanical properties or the localized signals versus the the the bulk signals and and the confinement within or the dynamics of how that network can respond to changes in a synthetic manner. So but but there's definitely a lot still to do to think about how to integrate the bio signaling into the physical models right and then how you do that for each and every tissue and each and every environment because they're different. So that would be our synthetic wet dream.",

      "transcript": "Yeah. Yeah so I mean one one big area is actually related a little bit to to what Stephanie mentioned before is thinking about when when there's an injury or trauma to the environment and especially in the context of a brain. So we've been looking at the extracellular matrix of the brain that is mainly laminin based and then how to think about making networks that would present these different types of cues of laminin but really what happens when something like traumatic brain injury or spinal cord injury happens right and then that scar is forming right and that scar the tissue is completely the environment is completely changing and it's actually starts looking more and more like a collagen matrix although collagen is not a big player in in brain it's not collagen one. Um so what we've been able to do for example is make synthetic matrices that recapitulate that architectural um trauma-based change where it's stiffer but it's also more bundling and it's tighter versus a loose soft network that would be more like brain. And when you culture cells especially the cells that are involved in the scar forming cells like astrocytes then you see the phenotype changing between when they are cultured on these bundled stiff matrices versus they're cultured on this uniform soft matrices. But the real key was to be able to transition between these two states. So really where we come in is the dynamics of it. So can we take that stiff environment and dynamically alter it to the softer network and then what what would happen to the phenotypes of the cells. So we've seen that when you do that the cells actually can revert their phenotype from a very scar-forming reactive state to a quiescent normal state which means that the environment there is playing a huge role in the scar forming process and if we were to understand it better or even be able to control these transitions of the environment we might be able to think about reverting diseases or states like spinal cord or traumatic brain injuries. So but there's more to it than just the physics and architecture right there's the so so that's the beginning to unravel the really huge complexity of that.",

I tried all kind of technology ECMs try to reprogram the cancer cell back to normal. Right now we may get a lot worse. We we're still trying to make it better and trying to make it we can make it worse we're close to make it better. Before I proceed fair is fair we have another VIP aka the boss wandered into the room. Silvia could you care to do a quick intro of yourself? She want to be quiet in the background that's okay we will not force her. All right so we are very close to the final wrapping up. I want to stop at 10 to give our scribe and reporters sufficient time to avoid running into the situation typing at the last minute like the other groups. I want to also using the last three minutes to seek input how should we report. You've seen all kind of report from really good pointed report to piling up everybody he said she said to you know a collection of ideas and how should this group do the report this conference and this day is a final of a CMC Scialog. So do you guys want to do continue the trend or you want to do something different? It's all yours. It's the final day I want us to go a little bit light.",
