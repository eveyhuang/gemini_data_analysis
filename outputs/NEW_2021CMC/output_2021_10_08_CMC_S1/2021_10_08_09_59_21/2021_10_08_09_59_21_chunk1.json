So I post out some of the instructions on the chat box you can take a look what do we mean because it's such a broader and popular topic of cell environmental interactions. So the the research group and Moore Foundation have put some guide by no means restrictive to those topic. So I will ask all of us take one minute and to uh share with us what will be the most important questions to ask if you concur with something listed great in your view and if you come up with something new that's totally fine and Paul will and I will take it from here. So one moment just one minute. And Abhishek it's on the chat in case you just came in.",
