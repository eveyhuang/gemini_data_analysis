      "transcript": "I was gonna say so Stephen Yi, I know your hand is up and I'm gonna push on some of the others who haven't spoken and then I'm gonna before I have you speak. And I'm gonna stimulate them a little bit to answer to try to address the question. I know Davide has a lot of thoughts on this and maybe Lu or Cheemeng as well. So in this protein folding business, one question is if I have a structure or whatever, what's I mean if I have a sequence, what's the structure, etc. That's the sort of naive structural question which AlphaFold is answering. You could also do and people have been using machine learning, I mean neural nets to propagate structures. So you can demonstrate that you can at least with simple all-atom models, you can learn a little bit of how to propagate from knowing our existing trajectories and propagate them. So you might even be able to use an AI to propagate a large protein and to be an integrator. And what Abhishek has kind of suggested is maybe that's that's like the obvious thing for us to do. We have an integrator, let's make a better integrator that uses the machine that is faster. But is there a different way in which we could think about dynamics or what's happening between these two, knowing the sequence and knowing the structure that would give us more information or different information that would be a different question that we need to address. So I'm wondering what you all think about that and that's my and I picked on Davide and I warned him he was going to be the next person I was going to pick on.",

      "transcript": "But I see this as an opportunity and I'm still thinking in terms of of what Rigoberto was saying. So this is a new set of tools that we can apply to answer more complex questions than just sequence versus structure. And one can go the the next little step is to look at metastability in in different environments because you just don't have the protein in in a solvation box and that's it. I think in real life you have different types of environments which probably affect the structure as well, partial folding or stuff like that. So that goes back to again using these tools with old tools like molecular dynamics, but I'm still in the Boltzmann world. I haven't gotten out of it.",
