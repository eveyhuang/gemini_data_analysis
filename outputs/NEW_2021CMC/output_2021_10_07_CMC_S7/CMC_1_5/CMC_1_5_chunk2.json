So we are interested in hydrogen bonds in in proteins and their functions, especially very short hydrogen bonds where quantum effects might be important. And then we recently developed a machine learning model that uses some of the structural chemical and sequence information to predict the presence of them. Although the prediction power was not that great because there are not enough experimental high resolution experimental data for us to to train the data. So ideally we want to move forward with not only just predicting their presence but also how they impact the environment around them, say the the protein active site structures and and stuff like that and their functions.",

For example, immune response predictions, genome mutation impact and network structure, all of that. So I think the immediate goal I would say in the near future would be to generate a chemical genetic interaction map. So that is really to facilitate precision medicine. So now I think the big question is like hey you have a patient coming to clinic with a new mutation we identified and doctor asked them to do a panel sequencing all of that. They did that and after that we don't know anything what to do next. So hopefully we can come up with a lookup table that you have these mutations and then their kind of associated unique drug that we can provide this is totally based on many different set of experiment data that we can map to generate. And now it's like coming into a scale that we can manage a large number. Hopefully this will be the short-term dream that we can achieve.",

And interest in AI ML is whether we can use that to guide the design or control or predict protein synthesis in those systems. And recently we've been trying to create I think what Rigoberto say about spiral feedback. We're trying to get into studying how membrane protein get into membrane and what we discovered or we found was that there's not much data around that. So when there's no data it's hard to do AI ML and when there's no systematic database how do you get that spiral feedback to get started. So a lot of what I see in proposals and research these days are a lot of based on available information but creating new spiral feedback is challenging.",

And also it's really super cool because and this might be useful as you as an experimentalist, you know that you have when you have a detector it's not always going to be perfect. You've got to sort of correct for the detector in the machine. So the car has its its various cameras but they're not going to always be exactly in the same spot and linked to each other to do the processing. So when you first start with your car it sucks. It doesn't it just barely shows you your car in in the image. And as it learns and gets feedback from the things it's seeing, it starts to realize that for your particular implementation of your car where your cameras are, how to triangulate and know exactly where an object is. So the objects start to appear in the first 100,000 and 2,000 miles that you're driving your car as it learns for your particular implementation. So it's it's like a machine function and it corrects for the machine function of the application.",
