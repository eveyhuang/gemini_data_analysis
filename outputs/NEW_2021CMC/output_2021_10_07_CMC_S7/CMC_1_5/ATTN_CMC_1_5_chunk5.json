      "transcript": "hopefully you can imagine a model might be able to learn patterns and be able to place the PTMs in sort of new locations. And I think that the reason why this doesn't work as well as let's say something like AlphaFold, I think it kind of boils down to like how good is the experimental data that you're trying to train off of. Like AlphaFold had the PDB. The PDB was just like an amazing resource that has been accumulating for 50 years, has all of these like forms of QC that are incorporated into the pipeline. We don't really have a database of that quality for all types of experimental data. And if we did, I guess what the AlphaFold story has taught us is that we probably could create really powerful AIs to predict things but it's just like how good are we as a community at sort of putting all of our experimental data together so that the ML gurus can then go to town, you know.",

And to use these trajectories as a source for for data mining. The problem is that they're it's expensive because if you think about even just one structure occupies a fair amount of of space and then if you how many slices you have. I mean I can easily fill up terabytes of space with just a small trajectory of only a small amount of time with only you know it's it's very so so this this is challenged by that. But",
