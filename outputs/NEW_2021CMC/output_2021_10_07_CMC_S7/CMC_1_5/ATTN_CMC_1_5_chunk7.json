But the free energy surface, this is arguably the third other method. You can always get free energy from simulations. How can you get free energy surfaces from experiments? With single molecule experiments you can do that. And I think from cryo-EM images, this is the other method where you can actually get an experimental free energy plot so to speak. And then you can compare if your simulations are as good.",
