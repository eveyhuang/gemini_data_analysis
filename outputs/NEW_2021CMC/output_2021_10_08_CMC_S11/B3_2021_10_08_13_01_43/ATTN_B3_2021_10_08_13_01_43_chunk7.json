And then yeah I mean if you propagating a signal in an embryo could be a harder problem. And that's where you start seeing specialized mechanisms where things are often moved around by cytoplasmic flows rather than pure diffusion or you get these waves in which one molecule activate the next and you get this spatial propagation. But normal small looking cell and probably similar problem are present in neurons right where to send a signal from the nucleus to a synapse could be it takes specialized mechanism because diffusion is not going to work. If you are a yeast cell things are going to diffuse within a couple of seconds so that's not a problem.",

Wenjing if nothing else there are one two three four sort of dark bolded questions which you could riff off to create an outline for your key points and maybe for each one of them you could sort of extract some kind of an overarching idea. So you can start to do that and then maybe if others want to pitch for key points that you think you've learned from this kind of flow of information that would be great that might help Wenjing as well.",

And I start to wonder if the concept is even useful anymore because it's kind of something we all talk about but none of us is saying the same thing when we're talking about it. So probably I guess we should move to some more precise terminology and just drop so this could be our take home message that just stop talking about self-organization.",
