You know something that times every event that you know that instructs every cell of what to do at every time. I mean it seems that I always think that if you build a control that way the amount of control you need is too much, right? There must be some ability of the system to get to the right state without external instructions. At least for part of the process.",

I guess my my question would just be whether or not you know it's not obvious to me that we that that one can simply supplant the attribute of robustness with the attribute of self-self-organization. I guess that particular distinction is actually lost on me to the extent or perhaps it's sort of already been ceded. But um you know it seems to me that you know clearly one can make claims about for example in the case of embryology you know the the the time scale on which robustness is attained right during the but that doesn't necessarily in any way say it's it's somehow less of a process of self-organization right. Like in the same way that in any physical process you know you always have sort of a nucleation event and so what one essentially claims that you know the formation of an embryo is a type of nucleation that then or sort of an initiation of some nucleation that that ultimately right the the robustness is whenever it's obtained is is then where self-organization takes over.",

      "transcript": "You know I really don't know anything about like on the on the scale beyond a single cell level like you know in terms of robustness. But if we just look at I guess look at cell or intracellular level right the the number of copies of receptors can vary from cell to cell. They all function you know they all perform the same function but there's a distribution right of number of copies of receptors. There's a distribution of you know there's a distribution of size and shape of the same organelles right in different cells. There is a distribution of like kinetics of chemical reactions even inside the same cell like for example you know endosomes they will have different kinetics of chemical reactions even when they perform the same functions. And and also based on you know what we know about the the you know the phase separation in in the cell functions and clustering of proteins aggregation of proteins can see that there is a range of sizes I guess you know that just seems to lead the the same outcome. So from I guess this is more like observation rather than trying to explain why that is but based on the observation seems like there is quite a buffer room the cells are designed to have those buffer room that they would reach the same goal even if there's some deviation from in all those processes from the beginning of you know the expression of protein to to how how the signal pathways come together.",

The I guess the not really the disadvantage but I would say more like a limitation is that unless you know what you're looking at right so you have to know like this is the molecule I'm interested in. And the limitation also comes from the fact that you can't look at the spatial and temporal changes of one molecule or two. But beyond that you know it's extremely hard to do from technical point of view technical difficulties. Also I don't know a very effective way in fluorescence imaging that allow you to say you know these two these two signaling waves let's say they actually have some correlation rather than just coincidence. I mean it's really hard I think it's really hard to prove the correlation between the different signaling molecules but in my opinion that's probably even more important in understanding how the cells function rather than just looking at the spatial and temporal changes of one single molecule.",
