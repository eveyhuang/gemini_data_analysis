But or one when we talk about multicellular unit that whole unit is a self and there's some kind of synchrony that is a master regulator and that is kind of putting the whole self together. So that's that's something that I always wonder, what is self?",

So it's this whole thing of moving from atomistic to meso scale that is somewhat driving my curiosity in that.",

So so one of the questions I'm interested in is sort of the the ways in which self-avoidance kind of is a kind of a recurring feature in kind of self-organizing patterns in biology and and in particular the you know kind of the fact that self-avoidance sort of comes up in different contexts and and I guess I I you know I guess my favorite examples are in the you know in the nervous system where individual neurons you know self-avoid in order to form kind of branched patterns and and and then meanwhile in the immune system where you have kind of different populations of cells that are also undergoing branching although in a different set of a different space namely genetic space in terms of the their immune receptors and the ways in which kind of self you know kind of the carving out of immune niches sort of sort of conceptually recapitulates that that underlying idea you know kind of you see in neuroscience and and I guess the question that I would have would be you know whether or not there's there's actually any sort of any anything fundamental that that that that one can connect between these two different types of phenomena and and and of course right whether or not it's possible to to test any such general principle.",

And while my lab is concentrating on particular class such as receptor tyrosine kinases but it will be very interesting to me to see how we can use a multi-scale approaches both experimental computational and experimental to get a handle on connecting different signaling networks and importantly to see what makes them stable enough for life to function but also they can break sometimes very easily seemingly with one mutation one point mutation.",
