      "transcript": "Okay, so what I'd like everyone to do is I don't know if I wrote your names down correctly, but hopefully you'll see that you're there. The question is what are the experimental and theoretical approaches to understand self-organization in biology, e.g., phase separation, signaling gradients, signaling waves, especially when arising from the integration of biochemical and mechanical signals. And you all came here thinking you wanted to either pitch an idea or ask a question. Pitch an idea would be a sentence. Ask a question would be a question. So I'm going to give you about two to three minutes to think of your idea, your question, and if you could write it next to your name in the Google Docs, that will help us remember what it is. But then we'll go in sequence with everyone reading their question, making the statement, and expanding on it a little bit. So, I'm going to give you three minutes.",

And then you're going to go out and then what you did what you've collected is what you're going to report out orally to the rest of the team in the breakout reports.",

So yes, you can look at an article I wrote about the ducks quacking if you had seen that. So let's see I'm going to go in order of everyone who spoke before. and then we'll just sort of quickly we'll go through everyone giving a little bit of an idea of what they want but if you want to pitch in and say well and start to riff off that's okay and then we'll figure out where we go from there.

But I'm an outsider so I don't know like how many mistakes how much room for mistakes is allowed like in this process like or it has to be perfect like 95% accurate every time in order for this to work perfectly. Yeah so I guess I don't have enough knowledge there might be enough knowledge already but if not then I guess is there a way that we can perturb these certain processes or something and then to see what would be required or necessary.",

Sorry I had it backwards because the number was 25 and 29 is closer to 25 than 18. So so just a small correction so we have reporter and recorder. So Gulcin I'm trying I'm doing a little bit of recording here just to help you out to get it get things started but you're going to take over all the recording and Wenjing and that's on the notes and then Wenjing you'll be the reporter with the PowerPoint. Is that is that fair? Report no record. You're going to report and Gulcin is going to record. Does that make sense? Yes.",
