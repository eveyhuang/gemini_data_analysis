But not in a let's say not in a in a in a specific deterministic way if you I mean it's not necessarily the right words I'm using here but but I think you got my the point with the analogy with these other the the not analogy the the comparison with these other enzymes that are very clear use of their ATP.

They have been validated on simple biological systems like unzipping an RNA or something, classic paper from way back when. But with those kinds of systems because they're simple you can basically track most of the degrees of freedom that we have you know that you need to. With a lot of these cellular things that's very hard, maybe not possible anytime soon. And so one question I've always asked myself is, you know, how bad can we do but still get away with using some of these ideas? That's you know, that and and and actually Holly your point about you know we abuse a lot of equilibrium thinking and apply it to steady state systems, but it does actually work a lot, right?",

I wonder if that's part of the problem here. What if we applied that same sort of first principles thinking but kind of come up with new laws and new rules for how biological active matter works? Because it seems to me like they're kind of operating by somewhat overlapping but quite different ways. You know what I mean? It might be just a matter of how you're starting the analysis.",

We start with molecules, how they move around, where they are, integrate and you get pressure, right? But with with this even where to start might be already an important question and it depends on what scale of question you're trying to ask. Like Brian was asking about metabolism and you know how that would affect cellular processes. That's already a lot of maybe some course graining there would help us answer questions.",

I was wondering if it's a matter of time scales and in in the sense of you know sure it's out of equilibrium but maybe at some time scales at which we're looking at the system, it doesn't really matter because it's not such a huge either because it
