        "1:57 Oh my gosh",
        "4:13 I'm just curious to know how about you when did you first heard about it and what is your perception after that and how you adapted your work style according to that",
        "4:20 Yeah, well thanks for sharing. Um, a lot of what you said resonated with me too. Um, I don't think I heard as early as you did. I think I was um, more in the camp of hoping that it was a small thing and that it wouldn't really be a huge disruption to life and that's not the case. So we had plans to go on a a short driving trip to visit my brother um, the weekend before everything broke out and people in my office were like I wouldn't go if I were you and we were still at the mentality at that point that it's not that serious like we're we're comfortable traveling we don't really care. Um, and it wasn't until like a week after that trip that we understood how serious it was. Um, I think we're almost three years to the day of when things started to really shut down at least in Chicago. Um, and I remember this because it was right around the time of my birthday which is next week and my partner and I were trying to make a plan but no restaurants were open. It was during that time when everything was just shut down before masks were out. It was just when people were saying don't go anywhere and don't use masks save them for the people who are, you know, in the healthcare profession. So our trip for my birthday since nothing was open, we drove to Michigan but we weren't able to even like get out anywhere to use the bathroom because everything was shut down and then we drove right back. So that's sort of how it kicked off for me. Um, your other question was about work and in terms of work, um, my work was able to be moved remote pretty easily so in terms of how it affected me on an individual level, I just moved to remote work. It did change some of the nature of my job because we do a lot of events for people are in person. So we had to think about, you know, what's permissible and safe and do we still have jobs. So, you know, there was some anxiety around that. Um, but yeah that that's sort of that's sort of how how I experienced it. It was also like a little bit for me it was um, I don't know if you knew people who were affected like really deeply. Like I didn't fortunately I didn't know anyone who passed from it um, or who had severe complications but um, on a less serious note it was really isolating. Um, to be in that time where you felt we felt we kind of kept a bubble and felt like we couldn't really interact with our friends in person the same way that we used to. So it was pretty isolating. Is that what you experienced too?",
        "5:57 Yeah, same. I felt the same way. It was a little bit discomforting as I mentioned because normally human beings are very social creature and becoming less social going backwards in time it was not easy for anyone of us. So but still we are it's it's it was important to break the chains and spread the spread prevent the spread from the virus. So that's why I ended up I adopted my work style according to that mostly my work involves working in field in teams in and having mostly in person in person work. So every time I have to I just any common surface any equipment or any team members during the entire operation I have to make sure that I am constantly sanitizing my hands keep wearing the mask even though the condition a little bit extreme. So that's why I have adapted my work style and lifestyle according to that. So normally I like to get go out talk to my friends interact them have them have this tangible feeling of in person interactions and because of the covid and and the social distancing I wasn't able to do that so it was a little bit slightly discomforting but at the same time I realized that it's important so important to follow the guidelines and stop the chains because the number of cases number of cases were increasing day by day.
