You have a particular catalyst, you have particular reaction conditions. So concentration of CO2, medium, electrolytes, etc. And then a range of different driving forces such as voltage. And then other sort of photon or or if you're thinking photocatalytic, then photon driven and maybe P photoelectro catalytic. So maybe those are combined. And so what we want to be able to say is, given control variables as well as driving forces, what will be the product distribution when product distribution of this reaction? That's sort of the highest order. And the second granularity would be that if you could understand exactly how that product was reached or or what were the what were the intermediate steps.

And so, understanding selectivity, I think, is still something that's very interesting and fundamental, but you know, I think to focus that could be the selectivity of CO2 reduction versus hydrogen evolution as one major bifurcation. And then, you know, what CO2 reduces to. I mean, my personal opinion is that at an industrial scale, electrochemical CO2 reduction at best will get us CO and formic acid, but I don't think at an industrial scale we're going to make any other product, and that's fine because I think the role that electrochemistry and electrochemical CO2 reduction can be making really stable robust precursors that can be converted by more, you know, advanced processes. So to me, you know, I think the discussion should be less about selectivity to kind of C2, C3, C4 products, but more this kind of intrinsic.

So, I guess, what is the comparison between electrocatalytic and photocatalytic processes versus thermal processes? Um, and in terms of let's say an electrocatalytic process, what kinds of faradaic efficiencies are we talking that would make these kinds of processes comparable to thermal catalytic processes or is that not even a worthwhile question, right? That's something that I'm curious about and since there are folks on the meeting that know more about electro and photocatalysis, that's something that I would love to learn more about. ",

I mean, that's sort of the, the coverage at which reaction turnovers are happening. So, and, and it may become like one in 100 or one in 1000 if it becomes bio, which, which then, what that means is the reactor then scales by 10x or 100x, right, for producing the same product. So you have to catch up by being 100x more efficient in turnover frequency, which is a very, I mean, that's a hard challenge, right?
