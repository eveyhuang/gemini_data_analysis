And so there are opportunities for your colleagues who have different experimental interests to engage. So we have one that overlaps a little bit with this one in that uh the advanced advancing bioimaging or neuroimaging is uh a thread in that. Um, and then we have a new one starting in October on the molecular basis of cognition. Um, uh looking at the pathways that lead to memory formation and memory loss uh trying to get not just to get away from the circuit level which has been well studied, but down to the molecular level of of some of what drives circuit formation etc. So uh",
