            "transcript": "if the gut microbiome is contributing to the metabolites of importance to brain health, whatever, I want to know, right? And we we debated in the previous session for a long time, does the gut microbiome change because there's a signal in the brain, things are changing centrally and this is down, or do the gut microbiome change induce changes in the brain? We talked about this back and forth, but end of the day, I need to know if my gut metabolites are changing, reflecting a gut dysbiosis. So can we develop a sensor, yes, that tells me my gut microbiome is changing, I'm not ready for a fecal transplant, but I'm ready to start to actively either take change my diet, my probiotics, anything out there that can help me improve the metabolic output of this bacteria that coexist with me is a good thing. Do we have sensors for gut dysbiosis? I don't think we do, but we know we have some ideas, yes, bile acids are, you know, and we put it back at the table for all of you, right?",

Yes, I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm going through changes not a good change, but I I stay within a domain for a long time. So when we talk about a baseline, I need a baseline for me. I think maybe that's precision really, I want to tailor things for me. I'm gathering big data on me right now, you know, I I want to know more about my health and the baseline for me is what matters more so than anything else. Yes, I want to compare to others, but I want to know about me. Yes, so uh, so the good news is when the metabolome changes drastically, you know that someone is in trouble. Yes.",

So uh, so you do want to get a sense and you know that the metabolome is a read out, it's a read out for the gut microbiome, the genome and the exposome, right? So something has changed that resulted in an apparent metabolic profile and so what? I think relevant to this theme, Emily, we are trying to decipher, so what? How do we test? If I have a change in my bile acid profile, yes, and I, you know, so what? I can move next and I was able to show that maybe the indol metabolism is change and I I know now it it it correlates with anxiety, development of anxiety in in in in 2000 people. If people who can produce more of indoxyl sulfate are are certainly those who have anxiety and high levels of this metabolite correlates with brain imaging changes in areas we know are relevant to development of mood changes and anxiety. So now I have data that tells me I got metabolic profile, eight six platforms whatever taught me something about relationship to anxiety, now where do I go from here? I know I have indoles, I have indoxyl sulfate.",

            "transcript": "Now, what where does that lead? Um, if this GPCR is activated, what sort of downstream pathways um can then sort of be activated from there? And to me that also gives like a handle for thinking about where would you also want to look for activation or rather for um presence of these different molecules to see um, you know, and if you're not in an in vitro setting, if you're actually going in vivo, are those molecules getting to the right place? But I think another um uh um challenge that I've sort of indirectly experienced in working with metabolomics data, um is that we're coming across a lot of molecules that we can't identify. I think that there's um a huge um uh set of of compounds that we we really struggle to kind of um to to to even know what their structure is. We know that things are changing or things are being produced, um, and that's that's been a big bottleneck for some of the studies that I've been doing. And I also think um and I I don't have a lot of direct experience with this, but those that do, I'm interested to hear, um, uh, the limit of detection, I think too, are the molecules that just because they're abundant doesn't mean they are and perhaps they may be even less important um if they're abundant in some context, um the ones that are really potent could be at really low levels, um, but still exerting outsized effect. So, I don't know, those are some of the things that have been challenges for my lab. Um, and I I don't um, yeah, I think that they're they've been hard for us to get around with. if anybody has thoughts on on on that.",
