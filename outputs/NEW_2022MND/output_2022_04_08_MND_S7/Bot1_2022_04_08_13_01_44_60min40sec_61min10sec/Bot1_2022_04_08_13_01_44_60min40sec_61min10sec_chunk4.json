I've shown this, I correlated with imaging, I correlated with behavior, right? The next step we did, we went back to animal models. We asked, is there indoxyl sulfate in the brain? Yes, there is. Yes, we looked at brain, stored brains from 500 brains stored in a large collection. We did metabolomics lipidomics on Ross map 500 brains. Yes, the indoxyl sulfate is there, plus many other metabolites produced by gut bacteria. In the case of the bile acids, no, first of all, we could not see bacteria in the brain.",

He can create a whole new gut microbiome with doesn't express indoxyl sulfate, genetically modulated, we go back to the animals.

I think there is a question of kind of the localization of the molecule, particularly if it's a microbially produced molecule and it's generated in a specific place, um, in the gut and a local interaction is very important. you know, you might see differences if you administer the molecule in different ways just on its own. And also, I think one one thing that's hard, maybe, you know, others have thoughts about this is sort of thinking about whether there might be sort of synergistic effects with multiple molecules and is it really just one thing that's likely to be problematic in these situations or or you know, could there be could it be also combinations of of molecules interacting with each other that might be important.
