I mean and you can imagine, I mean my dream, we talked about it in that earlier icebreaker session is that you can you can monitor all the different things you want to monitor at once. Of course that's probably being really greedy and you know we have to back off a little bit. But even the case that you brought up Elizabeth of a metabolite, if you could monitor that metabolite and who's who's eating it and what they're turning it into, so the life of that metabolite in the gut as it does whatever else it does in the body that would be something in the brain would be amazing.",

The reason I'm asking it is because screening like saliva for example or breath it's it's easier to actually going down in the in the gut, you know? So I was wondering is there any study or like solid evidence or not even that solid, I don't know what the word is between correlation of gut and like you know the microbiome that we have for example or similarly microbiome in our mouth and brain.",

I think they were seven different places. I don't remember what they all are. And you're right there's there's actual published data on the stuff in your mouth is linearly proportional. There are some lower throughput methods that might be useful for aerobic and anaerobic stuff to test specific hypothesis, but we need to get there. We need to know which specific hypothesis that we want to be testing on.",
