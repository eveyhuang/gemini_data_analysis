            "transcript": "And the number two, do you think that we should look for one environmental factor at a time or go for exposome? I mean, for example, I published that depends on where you live in Chicago, you have a different microbiota. These are healthy subjects. Now we are studying 150 people, we haven't published on that, to see what, uh, what is in that environment that will change the microbiota. And it is extremely complex. For example, in in a neighborhood, initially we thought the socio economic state, but in a neighborhood with a low socio economic, uh, state, say based on, uh, median price of the house, some neighborhood is high violence, some neighborhood has low violence, and the microbiota in those is is different. Is it the violence is more important or access to food and so on.",

            "transcript": "And the last thing I wanted to think about it, what would be the best control? Is it the household control, which I am biased about it, is better because at least you have some shared environment that you may eliminate the effect of environment and tease out the more relevant to disease or the sporadic thing. These three topics I'd like you to think about it, but I want to hear what Wenging thinks about the environment and that interaction in a Parkinson's that is a misfolded protein and in the gut going to the brain and so on. What do you think the role of environmental factor?",

            "transcript": "Yeah, so, uh, right. So I guess after hearing all like what you guys talk about and, uh, just makes me think like, uh, this is really like super complicated because I need to take into account all these, um, different environmental, um, exposure even at different time, and also the host might kind of, um, respond in different ways, at different host like even. So, um, and, um, but that also gets me to think more of that how can we reduce it to a more simple system, uh, I guess between the host and this micro uh organism kind of interactions. Um, so for at different time or different kind of exposure, um, whether we can reduce that to maybe, for example, the immune response, like, uh, right, you you say exposure at different time and then host might respond different so is it because, um, at different time our immune protection will be like most active certain time. So therefore, because my organism is kind of under check, um, by our immune system. Um, so like whether we right, so, um, let's then goes to, uh, I guess how the environment could maybe possibly affect the, um, protein folding problem like from the gut to the brain. And, um, if so there's one recent publication and talking about one of the microorganism, one bacteria and on their surface they have a protein that, uh, has a shape of the, um, beta amyloid. So, uh, how protein is prion like protein aggregate like taking place is because once they have a seed protein and that will help the propagation of the right all of the physiological protein, they will start like propagate more. And, um, so I don't know how many of these like, um, bacteria already could potentially already have, um, such kind of protein on their surface and, uh, right, so we can imagine that even their metabolize when the protein are degraded, when the bacteria degraded and then this protein whether they can be uptake by the, um, micro gut, the gut brain axis and that could for sure can affect, um, the neurodegenerative disease like development. Um, but what I don't know so much is I don't know what's the time scale like from the gut to the brain. Um, so for the protein aggregate to transmit from the gut to brain, that's a very long process that takes very, very long time. Um, but, uh, I I wonder whether there's more immediate. Of course that's very difficult to study, but whether there's a more immediate effect like from the gut to the brain that we can look at. And, uh, I think Ali you might know that much better that the information, I guess the small molecular mediated whatever transmission from the gut to brain, um, that probably will happen much more immediately and, uh, whether we can look at the information in brain and, um, and, uh, yeah, I still don't know how to quantify what whatever happens in the gut and to find the correlation.",

            "transcript": "Well, it depends because we really don't know for sure, uh, the, uh, mode of communication between gut and brain. There are some people that they are fond of hypothesis and they think it is preon and goes through the nerve and especially Vegas nerve, which I disagree because there is no Vegas nerve in the colon and which is rather largest concentration of bacteria. I'm not saying it doesn't happen, it happens but it's not 100%.",

            "transcript": "Uh, the, um, therefore if it is, if you believe in that, the, uh, time to communicate is going to be very slow. Uh, but if it is through the systemically, we think is, uh, extracellular vesicle, um, is probably one of the way to do it, it's going to be very fast. Um, it's going to be through the, um, the neuroendocrine such as GLP1, it may be, it may be important as well. Reason very important topic that you mentioned. Now, I just want to hear, uh, your answer to the question I have. When you are going to study the environmental factor in the context of brain gut axis, do you think that it should be one, uh, environmental factor at the time or we look at the global exposome?",

            "transcript": "a little tricky to think and record at the same time, but um I think it makes the most sense at least to my like fairly basic science self to start at the exposome level, try to find some of those associations and then take it down to the metabolite level. Odds are it's going to be more complicated than a single metabolite, right? That's just not how biology works. So if you could have a high throughput way where you could start to parse out like different combinations of things, that would be like amazing.",

            "transcript": "So it's really interesting is I would also probably fall into exposome camp because if you try to dissect everything that happens from sort of the gut lumen all the way up to the brain, you have to traverse like gut mucosa, crip cells. I mean, I mean there's just too much too much stuff in between. Um, the exposome also accounts for a ton of other uh, physiologic systems that you otherwise probably wouldn't consider in a traditional experimental system. So neuroendocrine, um, hepato biliary, I mean all these things play a role in all this sort of metabolite and sort of the ultimate processing of everything that's happening. Um, I know that I have a lot of, you know, I'm one of the the directors here at Wisconsin for the Center for Health Disparities Research and what we're trying to do is understand social determinants of health at a molecular level and it's going it's all about that idea of an exposome. And what's really interesting and Ran actually might be able to speak more to this because he's more of a computational guy, but there are really nice ML methods that are being developed to start to address this.",
