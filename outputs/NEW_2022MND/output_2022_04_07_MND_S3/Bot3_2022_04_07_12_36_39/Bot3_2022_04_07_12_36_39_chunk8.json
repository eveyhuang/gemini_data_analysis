Um so you know like what what's the mysterious physiology that's happening in the 20 to 30 years between what seems like, you know, moderate injury but you walked away from it and then this prevalence for um future neurodegeneration, which is kind of scary to think about. Like you think you're all good and then 30 years later you're not good.",

So if somebody is a youth football player, they get TBI, they're also not going to be the computer scientist typically that's going to be sitting in their chair, not engaging in these other risky risky activities, right? So I I I remain unconvinced that it's it's the actual",

So I I think that's what the for me, that's the real challenging part is like how do we start to disambiguate all of these different lines of causation that you can potentially go down and and I just how do you how do you work with that in human populations? How do you work with that in experimental system? I think that's ultimately the the challenge is how do we approach this as a community.",

Yeah, so I think the biggest challenge we study neurodegenerative disease is a big delay because you have to study like 30 years data on and why the course effect maybe is so uh it's really hard to draw that correlation or course effect and uh if only we have early diagnostics and very pretty good at prediction of like uh how likely like uh I I don't know what happens in the brain certain things and can very likely predict the uh the occurrence of neurodegeneration later on then that way might help us draw conclusion.",
