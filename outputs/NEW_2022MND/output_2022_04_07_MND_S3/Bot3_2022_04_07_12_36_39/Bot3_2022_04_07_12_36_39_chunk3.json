And in general axenic flies live longer, um but they're a bit of a nuisance to maintain in a fly lab that has a lot of not axenic flies.",

Um, do you is there a relationship between circadian rhythms are being out of rhythm and you had mentioned that different groups of flies have different dietary patterns like eat at different times of the day or split up their food or whatever that kind of thing. Is there a relationship between that and circadian rhythms?",

            "transcript": "Um, so we're that's something that I'm really intrigued by. So I in my postdoc lab I focused on circadian rhythms of locomotor behavior. And in flies, um they're what are called crepuscular. So they're most active at dawn and dusk. Um, and their locomotor behavior is very similar across background strains of flies. They all have a peak of activity in the morning and a peak of activity in the evening. Um, and I got really interested in investigating feeding rhythms, which is something newer in flies because we haven't really had the resolution to look at single fly feeding until more recently. Um, and so when I started to look at feeding, I thought that their feeding patterns would follow their locomotor activity, that they would eat the most when they were walking up, walking around, being awake the most. Um, and I thought that when I looked at classic circadian locomotor rhythm mutants that I would see the same deficits in their feeding rhythms. And what I found is that for flies, um locomotor activity and feeding rhythms are very decoupled.",

            "transcript": "Um, and to answer Jody's questions from the chat. Um, so humans are pretty terrible about how many hours a day they intake food. Um, actually, um, a couple of studies that have, well, they looked at largely undergraduate and graduate student populations. So I'm not sure how representative their food intake patterns are, probably amongst the worst, but um, they had they had students that wore um like essentially fitbits and then there was a button on their fitbit that they could press every time they put food in their mouth. So it was it was a really like they weren't trying to get them to log every meal. It was just like when you start eating press the button, when you stop eating press the button again. Um, and they found that on average in a cohort of thousands of students, people were eating 14 to 16 hours a day. Um, and um, so like between their first meal and their last meal, they were eating up to about 16 out of 24 hours. Um, and there's quite a lot of data that shows that restricting your feeding window to 10 hours or less per day is very beneficial for your health. Um, and so, you know, 16 hours is a pretty pretty broad window. Um, and and outside of the window of what most animals would eat um that are not humans. But most animals don't have insomnia cookies. Um, and they deliver till till 2:00 a.m. you guys. Just want you to know.",

            "transcript": "Uh Jody the so called right time eating, wrong time eating uh that uh initially defining rodents uh in rodents when they are free to of 12 uh they don't eat or they eat less than 10% during the light and eat the majority of the food uh during during the night because they are nocturnal. Um and in uh human uh the biggest study on the food timing came from the the group in uh script. Um and they in fact that the study that you're showing I think the script uh study. And from Sachin Panda, I think. Yes, the Panda from script, yes. Uh, and even there were people that they were eating 20 hours and they are not all students by the way. They were uh more varied part of it. Um, and it's shown in I think in Western societies recently, uh wrong time eating, that is to eat uh after uh dark when at least the brain uh master uh clock is uh trying to uh coordinate uh circadian different part of the body, um is going to be desynchronized. And that is what unfortunately we all mostly would do. And be another have shown that uh wrong time eating in animals or inappropriate uh non rhythmic eating in human is a pro inflammatory state. And if you believe uh that will promote inflammatory diseases, either you can trigger or perpetuate and worsen the disease course. Well, I don't want to spend all the time in in time and circadian although that is one of my interest. But one thing that uh I I'd like you to consider for the environmental factors that you are going to study, you you have to consider that the time of that environmental factor exposure to the host can have an impact. That is for we have shown both in animal and human, the time you use alcohol as a disruptor. And the time of when the the subject will drink alcohol have a different impact on their microbiota in their intestinal barrier and systemic inflammation.",

You know, the what's really interesting about some of these these topics is you can pull out. So like people have shown that certain, you know, gut drive metabolites influence uh, you know, brain activity and that can be measured any number of ways, EMG, neuroimaging, so on and so forth. But what's really interesting about that though is, you know, we eat and we have different metabolic fluctuations throughout the day. So if you measure somebody even in an animal at a certain time of day and you try to do it as rigorously and reproducibly as possible, it's still going to have some very large intrinsic variance. And so the question that I've always sort of ponder in the back of my head is how do we control for these metabolic variances that are occurring dynamically within the host? And how do we start to separate out signal from noise and what do we actually then start to comprise and assign significance to? And I don't think it's something that's going to be as simple and straightforward as like statistical significance because then how do you temporarily measure all of these things? How do you figure out what is a normal variation versus abnormal variation? Um, you know, conceptually you could potentially do this like in a in a vertebrate or invertebrate model as it were. Um, but we also know that that that translational step from that sort of, you know, small animal, small rodent system to human populations is it's just a ginormous astronomical jump. And so how do we then start in",
