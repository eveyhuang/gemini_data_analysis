Um I think there's more a lot of movement towards uh co-culture systems with um more engineering involved where you have small wells that are separating cells um to kind of create gut brain models that way. So I that's not something that I know much about, but that's certainly where people are going with um collaborating epithelial physiologist collaborating with um engineers and things like that.
