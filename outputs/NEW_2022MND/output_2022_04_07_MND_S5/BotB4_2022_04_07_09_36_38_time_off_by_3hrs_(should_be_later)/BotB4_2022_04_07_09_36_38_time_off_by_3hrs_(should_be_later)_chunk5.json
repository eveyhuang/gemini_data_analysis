I almost think that some of thing like this if you could if you could um have that kind of a technological probe that samples mucosal if you will or kind of adherent bacteria um that then you could do sequencing on and kind of target your in vitro screening models to the bugs that you now know are stuck to the mucosa maybe that would be a way to narrow things down a little bit from the entire gut microbiome. I am not a chemist or an engineer in any way but that was something that was brought up a bunch last year.",

So basically all the patients that come for colonoscopy, they go on cleansing so they're clean uh relatively clean and then you go with a scope and you can actually go against the wall and wash from there and take that part and that's where we did the sequencing and that's how we found what's associated with the mucosa but uh in humans it's very hard otherwise. If you go with a probe it's not going to go in the mucosa and sample clean because it will go goes after that in the fecal material. But in mice you can do a lot of cool stuff though. Uh but for humans it's kind of very tricky. We thought about it about two to three years before getting to the right procedure.",
