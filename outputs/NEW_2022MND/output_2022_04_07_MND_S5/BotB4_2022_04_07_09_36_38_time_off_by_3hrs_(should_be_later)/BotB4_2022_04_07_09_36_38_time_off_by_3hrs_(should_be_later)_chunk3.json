So E coli is an example of uh of a probiotic that um one of its functions of course is to is is niche defense because it's very similar to Shigella and uh salmonella, but um uh another thing that that's been found is in in these kind of monolayer type studies, I not I don't know about in vivo right now, but um you you find increased tight junction formation just from the administration of this this E coli.

So um but the actual barrier between cells is uh a sort of mostly protein, mostly extracellular matrix type material, like what is the downstream effect? Like what what we're talking about so far is like what signaling leads to this phenotype, right? But is it is there something about like um the the protein or carbohydrate makeup or availability of those things that may um that may contribute to that and you know, that's that's just I I think about things a lot on the molecular level. So that's that's kind of where I'm sort of coming from here and so if anybody can enlighten me in that respect that would be great.",

And then there wasn't. So we went patient by patient and isolated different strains of uh those fungi and then did genomics and number of different platforms in vitro and that's where actually all those strains, it was a lot of work. So a lot of strains basically split by their ability to damage epithelium or not and they're the same species. So from there we basically took over what is the reason and that's why we went for all the proteases but it wasn't that and then in the genome we found actually this fragment which is responsible for activation of toxin that is process extra cellularly. So so anyway and that toxin though is super potent.
