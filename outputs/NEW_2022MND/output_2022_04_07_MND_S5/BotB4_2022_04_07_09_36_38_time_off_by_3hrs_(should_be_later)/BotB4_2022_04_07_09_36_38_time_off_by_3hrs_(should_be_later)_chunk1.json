We're also interested in figuring out how neurological diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases manifest in the enteric nervous system. So, this is a brief overview.",

So I'm interested in the microbiome both as something that might facilitate some of the genetic environmental interactions that lead to the immune disregulation of MS. I'm also interested in in it as a biomarker of something that may be able to help us detect um, when something first starts to go awry that ultimately would lead to autoimmunity. Um, so that's my general interests.",

So our goal is to secrete small molecules or peptides or proteins in situ in the gut and in order to do that, obviously it has to thrive in this very competitive environment and be able to do its job, which is secretion of the of the therapeutic. And so we're really interested in we do genome engineering to look at the genes that affect survival phenotypes of these bacteria and we're also interested in the um access between prebiotics uh and uh and the growth of these bugs in this environment.
