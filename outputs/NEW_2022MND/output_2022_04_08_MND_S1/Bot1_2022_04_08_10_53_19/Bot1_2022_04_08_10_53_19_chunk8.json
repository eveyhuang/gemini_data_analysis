I don't she didn't mention the species, but oral prevotella in um in the gut samples of those autistic children. So I I think there's a lot of potential there because I think the oral cavity presents a more um accessible diagnostic resource and potentially even a location for intervention that's more accessible that is exciting to me.",

And if you're your climax community is heavily populated by for example peripathogens or cariogenic pathogens, then it's difficult to shift that. That's why people who tend to have cavities tend to have cavities and who tend to have gum disease tend to have gum disease.",
