Um and we look in regions like the hippocampus and the hypothalamus for its connection with learning and dementia and then hypothalamus for feeding regulation and we see um just increased microgliosis like an increase in neuroinflammation as like a general answer to that. But um we do actually see in our specific C57 black six mice is a difference between males and females. So really interesting rabbit hole that I just could go down for a while is um male mice gain a lot more weight on a high fat diet in the amount of time that we feed them compared to females. And then we've started to look at some lipid um metabolism factors and then because they've gained like that increase adiposity um does connect with that increase in hypothalamic um microgliosis that could impact some of the local signaling that regulates satiety and feeding behaviors um on top of so many other things. So that's my that's my interest there.",

I mean, there's almost no literature, but I know that there's a funding there's like a funding source been out for a few years specifically asking about microbial infection and the possible link to Alzheimer's. There's really only one solid paper, recent paper, I guess spotting this whole idea. I think it's Nature Communications paper. Um and it wasn't it those of you who study aging and Alzheimer's or whatever in your mouse models will have far more sophisticated ways to answer the question. But the but the bottom line was they just infected mice with Candida, I believe, and then they saw which I've I've done Candida infections too. It's true the mice act weird.",
