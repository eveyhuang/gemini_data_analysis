Um which was more or less criticized. Um but I don't know I I I don't know there. There um I don't know I'm maybe Heather has has some input there, but I feel it's the type of thing that would be particularly studied in soil communities because that's where most of these um molecules will be produced and and we're trying to understand that.",

So I was going to ask AO about um like predicting outcomes you probably uh studying a single cell type in the neurological system is probably not going to predict even if that cell type is the initial target or particularly sensitive to a an insult that probably isn't necessarily going to predict the actual outcome.

Um I I think it's uh it's a you know, we're moving to more systems neuroscience, I guess, but at the same time too, we still cannot negate understanding cellular neuroscience, right? We we still have to understand each of the individual components, but we can't stop there. And uh none of these diseases or or organs are monolithic, you know, we have to understand them all together. It's funny um you you talk about emergent property in our field, I I was in a different group. I don't know if any of you were there. Forgive me if one of you was there and I I mentioned this. Uh somebody was or maybe it was yesterday when we were chatting. Somebody was um talking about studying micro vitro. And I was like, you know, a lot of us run away from studying micro vitro anymore because you know, micro vitro tells, you know, we see something about them and this is also true for sites. But once we put them in the brain, they look different and they they have quote unquote emergent properties once they're once they're hanging out with neurons and hanging out with other cell types, they they have emergent properties.
