I'm trying to remember the exact data of it now and I'm not a population geneticist so I always sort of lose some details but populations that there's evidence that there are genetic changes associated with more like the the increased likelihood of helmet infection. That's a really wishy-washy thing. I'm sorry. I don't remember that piece of data.",

So we think of helmets sometimes as parasites when you have a really high infectious burden in a child that can lead to wasting disease but there's a continual like the immune response never makes a protective response. It takes a lot of uh exposures to get enough antibody to protect you from actually being infected.",

            "transcript": "And when the worm gets in and establishes a persistent infection, it changes the immune response in a really sort of long-term way. It induces a type two response that is associated with wound healing and we think that the whole idea that we have this wound healing response, like it it gave us this uh this arm of the immune system. And if we didn't have helmet infection, maybe we wouldn't have this this pathway um in our immune response. And now like the the hygiene hypothesis is so big and it covers so many things. Um but the idea that populations that don't have helmet infection are more likely to have autoimmune diseases um is one that we use a lot to rationalize some of the work that we do. So another the idea that it's an early infection, it helps shape your immune response, educates this regulatory and wound healing aspect of your immune response could be protective much later in life against the development of things like asthma, allergy, autoimmunity and IBD.",

            "transcript": "I kind of want to like add to what Lisa just said and and come back to a point that was also made before about like what is coevolution? It's it's with the idea that there are different once again, there are many different members within the gut microbiota and it coevolution between these different members um like might have might have different impacts on the human host. Like the whole point of all these microorganisms like co-evolving is to like stay within the system whereas we theoretically want to get them out or want to keep some of them. So it I think there's a there's a notion of scale that we also have to consider in terms of coevolution because basically within a month coevolution could have happened for microbial communities are turning over very rapidly but there's very clearly no coevolution at that stage in in terms like from the host perspective. So I guess it kind of depends on what coevolution level are we looking at because that will definitely have very different results and and and the the time frame, the temporal studies that Nandita was talking about, I think become essential there and and at very different levels like obviously like at daily levels but also over the course of the lifespan or even human history because I mean yes we've co-adapted with these microorganisms but our diet now doesn't resemble by any stretch of the imagination like homo sapiens like early on. So there it it just that that there's this shifting frame the whole time at different levels and I think that's for me conceptually probably the most like complicated and most probably interesting thing to to to look at is trying to see like how can we integrate these different temporal levels and scale levels also in in terms of coevolution.",

            "transcript": "Actually your point about diet is um well taken and I wonder if um I mean this idea has been bounced around a lot in the literature about lactose persistence. There's a clear human genetic adaptation to lactose uh lactose consumption and um people have wondered if the microbiome can help those who are not lactose persistent to digest milk. Um and I think people have tried to look for evidence for different species abundances in hosts with and without the lactose persistence alleles. But I haven't seen work looking at um like genetic adaptations in the microbiome for those that are lactose persistent versus not. So um that could be one way to look retrospectively across the course of human history.",

I just want to know that those those genotype are also associated with a specific type of uh bifido bacteria. So the host genetics that locus also has impact on the micro competition.",

Because like with the advent of cooking and making bread and all that sort of stuff versus just like eating raw fruits or whatever. And and there I I think probably there should be historically speaking like a good record of of when all these agricultural practices shifted and obviously diet shifts also and how how did that come into place too.",

Um so yeah, I I think that Ruthley's example is really compelling and they like even show for different human genotypes the different microbial compositions. But I don't think that's coevolution because then you don't in that case you don't have a change in the genetics of the other player of the uh of the bifidobacterium.",

So the same haplotype can then accumulate new mutations. This is in my opinion distinct from a strain fluctuation where let's say you have a closely related uh lineage that just fluctuates in frequency because that's not creating a new haplotype. It's not a genetic innovation.",

The microbiome can evolve and you can see genetic changes that, you know, have higher fitness and change in, you know, uh frequency within, you know, a year, a year, a few years, right? And for the host, if you're looking at humans, right? The scale of evolution is, you know, thousands and thousands of years. How do we how how can we reconcile these two things when we talk about coevolution? I'm I'm not sure. It's I I really have no idea.",
