And it could be like somebody said, uh, you know, at the end of the day, it's the small molecules, the metabolites and so it could be different microbes in different individuals or different parts of the world or something that are playing that mediator role, uh, and um, but they're responding to some human genetic factor, uh, to to to make the coupling between the microbiome and the human genetics and the phenotype that gets selected for. Is that makes sense?",

The the major limiting factor is to finding genetic factors associated with micro composition. And as George mentioned, micro composition has very low heritability. And right now the G was for those microbiome is usually small sample size. I think the biggest one we have right now is 6,000 and they were able to find quite some associations. And one question I have for Lisa is that so for for mice, you can find specific gene, select for specific micro. If you look at that same gene in human, does those gene also associate with micro in human?",

Um, but we're moving much towards uh as Karen was saying like thinking about metabolites and what's important. Um, like some SFB is one tiny example. SFB colonizes mice, but it doesn't colonize people. You do have similar or microbes that attach to the intestinal epithelium and induce a similar response in people, but it's not the same strain. So looking at fila or like looking at taxonomic levels across human and mice isn't always particularly informative.",

It's usually not huge. But we're there aren't very many studies that have like we haven't come up with a signature like it's only acromancia that is always different across all of these studies.

So there's this massive control of the microbiome by the host genetics just demonstrated by that alone. And so you, you know, you imagine that playing out over animal evolution time scales and things like that. There's going to be a lot of microbiomes appearing as the host genetics evolves and changes from time to time and uh, um, you know, that's sort of a 20,000 foot hand waving thing that says there's coevolution, but it, you know, it's so what? What's what's being selected for there? What's the, you know, is the microbiome this major mediator of phenotypes and animals that are being selected for as they evolve, uh, and it's, you know, like the the dark matter of evolution or something like that, uh, the the missing heritability, you know, all that kind of stuff, it's really the microbiome because you're you're not looking at the mediator, you're just trying to connect things that are not directly connected or what's going on.",
