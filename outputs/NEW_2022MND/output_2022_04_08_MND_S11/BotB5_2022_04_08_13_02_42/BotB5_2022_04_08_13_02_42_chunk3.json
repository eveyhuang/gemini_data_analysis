And then how you look at at causation, um, think is is more complicated and how you want to how you want to pull that apart. If you can get it down to a molecular level, then certainly you can you can look at it in the same way we look at knocking out a gene or over expressing a gene. What do what do other people think about this?",

            "transcript": "I mean, I think I think a lot of people just rely heavily on mouse models like germ freebiotic to introduce like if there's a particular strain that seems to be responsible for some phenotype, potentially even in humans and they'll just use a defined community with or without this strain and then see if it tracks with the phenotype. So that's I think that's a widely used to kind of establish causality, but I think as Judith was suggesting it's highly reductive. I mean, you can't the environmental factors, the composition of the microbiome, all of that is um on a much more simplistic level than what you would ever encounter in a human population. So even that I don't know how how satisfactory that is to establish causality, but it's maybe the best that we can do at the moment.",

Um, the fecal sample has gone through the entire GI tract, right? So those metabolite levels there, maybe may not necessarily reflect what's happening in the places where there are inflammation. Um, and so there's a biogeography element here that I think is really unexplored. Um, and also uh, you know, just uh sensing of of metabolites at this, you know, endpoint uh may not reflect the whole picture.",

Uh we're really about engineering the chassis organism uh to be robust in in the gut environment. Um, you know, using these prebiotics and other sort of genome scale libraries to identify which genes contribute to robustness phenotypes. Um, we chose bute as sort of a first pass because it was something that we could well, it wasn't super easy. We made six different genetic for knockouts and a bunch of other pathways to plop into E coli, but it was sort of a just a proof of concept because of the um the importance of bute. But again, what we and the reason I kind of brought this up is because this is something I ran into is that where does there need to be bute, right? These guys, where do these guys colonize? They colonize in the small intestine, right? Uh, most of the bute is probably being made in the in the in the distal colon, right? So, um, you know, uh, so one thing we're working on right now is is sort of a uh a sensor that'll let us visualize bute um in the gut uh, you know, visualize that biogeography.",
