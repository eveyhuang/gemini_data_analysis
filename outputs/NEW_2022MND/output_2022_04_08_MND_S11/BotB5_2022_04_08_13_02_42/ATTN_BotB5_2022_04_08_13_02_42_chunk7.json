   "transcript": "I'm curious what Ron thinks is the types of numbers. I mean a lot of microbiome studies will throw out kind of single digit 20, 30. Obviously that's tiny. But in the genetic world you need tens of thousands and um and I think that there's so much difference in terms of how microbial organisms are classified taxonomically so you can use 16s but 16s that you do from B1 through 3 is different from B4 is different from B4 or 5 is different from long amplicon is different from um shotgun like shotgun. So what's the like how similar do they need to be and do we need tens of thousands with a single technique because we're in for a world of herd if that's the case um or could we get with hundreds and could we combine technique what do you think Ron? I'm curious as to your thoughts here.",

   "transcript": "This is a really good question and I don't know the answer because I don't know what the I don't know what the effect size is. Like if I knew what the effect size is is going to be then you can you know do like a power analysis and say you know this is this is the size this is the sample size we need to find the effect size but I don't know what the effect size is and I don't know how complex the interaction is. Um is it going to be just you know one microbe and each microbe is independently has an effect size or is it just this microbe that they have to be combined and have interaction between them. So this would all depend I think I don't know my my feeling based on nothing but just a feeling based on what we know from genetics is it's probably going to be in the thousands to get you know strong replicable um signals. Um and you know and the in genetics right the sample sizes now to look at some of the like diseases and phenotypes that have um many genes associated with them now they're looking at you know 500,000 sample size 500,000 or a million um or more and you keep finding more things right? You still keep finding more and more things that have very small effect sizes. Um so it's it's kind of unlimited you know. It's possible that every microbe has some kind of a role and that role is very small and for some microbes it's very very small and in that case you're going to need you know huge sample sizes yeah.",
