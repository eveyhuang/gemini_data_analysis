Um and so some of the stuff that my lab has been doing is finding these initial markers and asking how they are contributing to like alpha synuclein aggregation in the in the GI tract. Um and I wonder about this in the context of um a beta and Alzheimer's um disease. I I have not um I don't know much about Alzheimer's disease unfortunately, but just a quick Google search it looks like there have been recent um reports of a beta um in the GI tract. Um and so some of the questions I have there are what is known about mechanisms of aggregate formation in um for a beta and also with alpha synuclein did they have commonalities and and I have I have yeah really no idea on the molecular side of um Alzheimer's disease. But that's something I guess I'm thinking about here um",

Going back to the inflammations that uh Elizabeth mentioned, there is at least three good epidemiological study that association between inflammatory bowel disease and Parkinson disease. And in one of them in those patient that uh treated with uh biologic TNF antibody infliximab that increase disappeared. Now is a paper that Dr. Tanji published and the co-author on it as well in MPTP model using uh DSS uh to create colitis, it worsen the colitis. worsen the Parkinson is a paper we just send it by PhD student we use a very low dose uh DSS uh to cause gut leak without overt inflammation.
