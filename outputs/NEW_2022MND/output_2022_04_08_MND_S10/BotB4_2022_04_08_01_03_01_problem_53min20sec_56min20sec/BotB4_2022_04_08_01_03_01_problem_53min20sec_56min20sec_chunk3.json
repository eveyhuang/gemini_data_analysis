Remember 10 15 years ago even when I started with Parkinson no one thought Parkinson is the inflammatory disease. Now is a great deal of interest but remember that even 15 10 years ago people thought the brain is a privilege organ. There is no immunity in the brain. Now we know it is not the case. People thought that the lymphocyte cannot go to the brain. And I remember 10 years ago in one of my paper we showed there is a neutrophil is a lymphocyte in the brain of the mice and the reviewers said I don't believe it. it's just in the circulation and uh in fact forced me to take it out of the paper. And now we know there are lymphocytes in the brain. We know that microglial is acting like a macrophage in the brain. We know that with all of those things we know that brain is no longer a privileged immune organ. Um now how do you think that we can um weaving gut inflammation in the context of brain gut access in neurodegeneration. You have a tool you said how can how can we leverage your tool to understand that.",

And my lab is really interested in looking at neural immune synapses that form uh in immune organs in the gut like the mesenteric lymph nodes. Um that tool allows us to understand I think more mechanistically um what receptors are important in the dynamics of that communication. We struggle though a lot of relating that back to what's happening in the brain because these are sympathetic neurons that are innervated here. Um not you know it's we're not measuring anything directly in the brain when we're doing these specific studies.",

            "transcript": "Um so theoretically you can use big data to um uh to try to infer causal models. That's like one of the hottest things in artificial intelligence these days. But the data um that we need it has to be so dense so longitudinal that I'm actually a little skeptical that we can actually come up with dynamic models. Um kind of like the when I say modeling that we do is um more towards um biochemical processes and metabolism which I don't think is very relevant to this discussion. But um one thing I'd like to add um regarding neurochemicals that that Ashley mentioned is um kind of the work we're doing is some kind of genome mining analysis where you could look at the genes of the bacteria of of any bacteria and see if they have something called biosynthetic gene clusters which are uh which produce natural products. Um natural products are secondary metabolites. They're not like the amino acids or lipids or uh sugars that we're used to or short chain fatty acids that we're used to but they're more like these complicated drug looking like uh chemical structures. Um kind of what I'm interested in the reason why we went this route is we're seeing all these bugs in the literature that is associated with diseases but I tell my postdocs all the time I don't care about the bug. I care about what they make uh about how they're communicating is it the small molecules is it the peptides that they're making. Let's get into that. Um so that's my long answer to no my models will not help here Ali but um using some kind of uh omics analysis whether it's looking at the genome whether it's looking at some kind of uh metabolic space like the metabolome or as you mentioned some kind of gene expression would at least point towards what are the biochemical processes that the gut microbes are doing that may be spit out into the chemical milieu and then go up through circulation into the brain causing some kind of uh degenerative auto um degenerate effect caused by inflammation.",

            "timestamp": "08:31-09:59",
            "transcript": "Yeah, I mean we talked about this a little bit yesterday and I think one area that's a bit neglected is we we think about the epithelial barrier uh and mucus barrier but what about the endothelial barrier right there in the gut. Um where there's of course a lot of focus on the blood brain barrier but there's tight junctions between the endothelium and the mesenteric circulation as well. So I think that's really overlooked uh and like you say once there's inflammation there um that's kind of the last the last barrier before that signal is going to be disseminated uh throughout the body. Um so yeah I think that when Ashley was talking an interesting idea that came up was we've been able to track immune cells or label immune cells in the gut and then track them as they travel to the brain. Um we've done this by injection of dyes into the the Pires patches as well as as the MLN. Um it'd be really interesting to use some of these sensors uh in these discrete regions like the Pires patches to see what are the what are the microbial signals uh potentially neuropeptides that are affecting those immune cells in those regions and then how does that alter",
