Uh there is the reason is GLP one is so relevant in metabolic syndrome um and obesity in fact GLP the the normal GLP GLP one produced by the L cells in the neuroendocrine in the gut and it rises after food and those people that they are obese or even they are not obese but they have but metabolic syndrome that rise is planted and we just published that in patient with Parkinson disease they exactly as if they are they have got metabolic syndrome or obese or they are not and there is epidemiological studies that if you have metabolic syndrome the risk of you getting both Alzheimer or Parkinson is increased by twofold and in vitro study also show that GLP one is neuroprotective. So we are asking the question uh whether loss of GLP one which by the way GLP one is produce production of the GLP one is augmented with short chain fatty acid. One can argue that this biosis with a low short chain fatty acid decrease the production of the GLP one and and so on and so on. Uh for with you but we are not measuring we are measuring the serum. We don't we are not measuring anything local because we don't have the tool as you have. Um.",

            "transcript": "I just came up with three of you have a project that write write write things and if I'm sure it's going to be I mean one of the way that I'm doing for to look at the relationship with the gut inflammation and the brain we are creating the colitis and see whether it's going to get worse in the brain in the animal model and in fact I mentioned this morning when we use a very low inflammation just point uh 1% uh DSS that would cause barely the colitis the calprotectin is not elevated but MPO is elevated and so on we at least in our models we didn't even increase microal activation we didn't do anything. Uh but the higher dose it can. Uh but that is a very crude way of looking at the relationship. The other one in human that we are doing but I don't have that uh tool that Jay you have we are you you know about the extracellular vesicles. Yeah. Uh we now you know with the surface markers you can identify whether they come from the gut or intestinal epithelium or from the brain. You don't know whether they come from the brain whether they come from the microal or the neurons. Um and we showed in patient with Parkinson disease they have increased uh EV in their blood including uh gut derived EV. And and and we are not working with a group in uh Caltech to look at the uh cargo of the EV uh to for the proteomics. And apparently in proteomics world the annotation for bacteria drive peptides is woefully inadequate and we are not getting anything there but my hope is that if we show that you're going to have lots of uh the proinflammatory uh molecules that come from the gut and is associated with severely disease you may get some association using some of the modeling that you guys are doing but still not quite right. But so far in my opinion there are enough noises that gut inflammation has something to do with it but the direct evidence is missing. Now do you think that gut inflammation is promoting neuro inflammation is it because gut inflammation associated with this dysbiosis is all bacteria or is independent of bacteria? And how are we going to tease that one out? Because when you get gut inflammation you're going to get dysbiosis.",

There is no ubiosis the same way that there is no normal height. We are having a different height. There is no in my opinion normal uh there are eye colors or different variety and the gut bacteria is the same. Each of us have our own signature. But if you get forced to say what dysbiosis is the way I define is disruption of microbiota community to become uh pathogenic and toxic for that disease process which primarily uh proinflammatory community. I mean for example in Parkinson we define it as increase relative abundance of pathobion concomitantly decrease relative abundance of short chain fatty acid producers. One has to be very careful if we say dysbiosis to make sure it doesn't mean we know the ubiosis for that given content that you have disruption of the microbiota community away from the control uh that is for that disease has a potential to be pathogenic and toxic.
