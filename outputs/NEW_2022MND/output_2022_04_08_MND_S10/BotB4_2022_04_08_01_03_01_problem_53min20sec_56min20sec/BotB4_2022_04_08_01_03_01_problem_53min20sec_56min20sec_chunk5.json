But we are saying that household control may be the best control because the environmental factor is a consequence of disease can be eliminated and then they will have a much better disbiosis signature, but I'm not sure whether we are right or not.",

But there are different bacteria in a different cohort is decreased. Some cohort is blausia, some cohort is and so on.

So there is inflammation in the gut, there is inflammation in the brain. To me the biggest black box lies in the middle and this is something that I've struggled with in my own studies. If there's gut derived inflammation for me with hypertension and I'm still looking at brain inflammation. Why is it that that when that inflammation disseminates um that it ends up at brain. Um and then in chronic kidney disease it ends up at kidney. But you don't ever have it everywhere. So is there some type of second hit that's required in brain that's then drawing that inflammatory signal there? The we can do transplants to germ free and that would suggest that maybe it's not a second hit that's required if you can just change the biome and still see the same phenotype in one specific tissue. Um so yeah, I don't know if if there's it's two hit model that's required to get it there or if there's what what's what's the targeting mechanism to get that inflammation from to from one site to a very distant site. Um I think that's the not the lowest hanging fruit by any means but probably the most uh intriguing question.",

For you are going to have people that they have microbiota community again is composition. You remember that. I think we should think of the metabolomics. But even metabolic metabolomics is some overlap. That they have the issues, they have the microbiota and they don't have a disease. And that is come up with the idea of the second hit. I can I test the idea of second hit in my other studies of alcohol. There are only 10 20% of the alcoholics get organ damage. And the other interesting part as some of them get liver disease and when they die the liver is rotten and the brain and heart is perfect. And some of them they have got massive brain brain problem and when you do a postmortem the the liver is perfect. What? It's the same alcohol and and the idea that we came we we thought that alcohol wouldn't cause any issue unless they got disbiosis and got leak and we have shown that one and other have shown and then the question is why is it just only subset of people only going to get that. One of the idea that we have and we published on is the disruption of the circadian rhythm. that uh if you have host had a disruption of the circadian rhythm at least make gut more susceptible to the second hit. and the study that we did we got the series of nurses, day nurses and uh shift nurses and we give them alcohol because one glass of red wine a day for seven days, one to one and a half is 0.5 g to kilogram.
