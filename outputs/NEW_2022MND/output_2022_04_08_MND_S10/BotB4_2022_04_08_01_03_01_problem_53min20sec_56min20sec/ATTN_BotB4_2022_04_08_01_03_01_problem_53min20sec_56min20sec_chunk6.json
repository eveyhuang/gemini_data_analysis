For he said that if you are having shift work, you're not going to get in trouble. If you had a second hit, where there is alcohol, you're going to get in trouble. That is a very clear cut of the second hit.",

   "transcript": "I I think the original question is what do we do next, right? Um with all of this information. I'm going to give my very vague analytical chemistry uh answer to this because I think a lot of times you know, I think I think more broadly to approach these sorts of difficult questions. A lot of times we're always in our own silos of what tools and techniques and methods of measurement and imaging and that we are uh great at doing and a lot of those techniques out there are really great for looking at very specific things and I think to actually solve these problems, we need silos like this where we're all coming together and bringing all of our expertise. I don't think one person's going to have the answer to this question. I think we all have to bring all of our different tools to the table. Um and then also some thoughts I had is it seems like we're always trying to figure out what came first, the chicken or the egg, the inflammation. And I mean, this may be my very simplistic view of the body, but it it seems like everything's in a constant feedback loop. So maybe it's not always inflammation came first and then this. It's not always a causal and effect. And I think there's a lot of different outside factors that could probably contribute to that. Things environmental stress. I know there's a lot of work now looking at stress and neuroinflammation and things like that. Um so I think it's complicated and I I I don't think there's a one size fits all solution to it, especially for human work because of how different all of our experiences on a day-to-day life are for sure that influences like what you were talking about where some people can drink their entire lives and be fine and others can't. There's got to be some other underlying, not just biochemical differences, but also, you know, stress and environmental factors that are at play there.",

We only have one slide, so we can't fit in too much. So um I'm I'm finishing up that last point that I really liked from Ashley. Biologist complicated continuous uh feedback loop, so many known and unknown factors causing um observable phenotypes. I'll anyway, this is we so basically there was um I don't know if you guys see this, but there were actually four questions, but we only really talked about one and I think that's okay. Um I mean, we could have probably talked about this more for another hour if we wanted to. So what I'm going to try to do is I'm going to I'll show this to everybody here. Um and we can just see if what I wrote down is okay and then I'll move this towards the slide and I'll figure out how to talk about it. But um there was a lot more obviously there was a lot more than um than what I wrote here, but um you know, we can't put talk about everything in the slide. So this is just what I have, guys.",
