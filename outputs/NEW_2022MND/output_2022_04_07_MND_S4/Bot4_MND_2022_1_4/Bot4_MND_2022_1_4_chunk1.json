Um, you know, thinking about the enteric nervous system, um, and how the neurons in the gut regulate the tissue homeostasis, I know they play an important role in uh the the epithelial barrier. And so if you have inflammatory conditions that affect the neurons or in some uh developmental defects if the nerves are not developed properly or the tissue is as they call it aganglionic, the epithelium becomes leaky then that then leads to more inflammation and more damage to the nerves and this cascade perpetual cascade of tissue inflammation and breakdown. Um, I don't really know much about how much has been done in terms of the role of microbiome in this process. If there has been studies any like in in mice or in human patients with germ free versus, you know, antibiotic I don't I don't really know if anything has been done in that space, but I know that there's a lot of cross talk between tissue components there and all of those tissue components could be targeted by microbial factors directly or indirectly. there's a lot to unpack there for sure.",
