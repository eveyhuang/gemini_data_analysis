So a lot of strains basically split by their ability to damage epithelium or not and they are the same species. So from there we basically took over what is the reason and that's why we went for all the proteases but it wasn't that and then in the genome we found actually this fragment which is responsible for activation of toxin that is process extreme severely. So so anyway and that toxin though is super potent and it's actually released in the patients and it correlates with patients that have severe disease they care carry the strains that produce the toxin. So so it's it didn't go with the screening in the beginning.",

            "transcript": "So Aaron's comment on the the link via the uh immune system kind of brought something to mind. There's been some increased interest lately in terms of uh the inflammatory response originating from the meninges and then migrating into the brain. Um as we've looked at stroke models more closely, it's not just inflammation in the parenchyma but uh it seems like a a large portion of those immune cells are coming from from the meninges and uh it's one of these areas where there's fenestrated uh on the Venus side so it's one of these areas that are very open uh to potentially either metabolites or to uh endotoxins things like that coming from uh from the gut. And there there's just some really interesting observations there. For instance, if you get inflammation and upregulation of IGA in the gut, it also corresponds with increased IGA production uh in the dural layer. Um so it's kind of this co-evolutionary idea that it's it's in the benefit of the organism to if something gets across the epithelial barrier to also be able to recognize that at the brain um and respond in a very rapid way whether that be uh plasma cells which are migrating sensitize in the gut and then migrating into these these areas in the meninges that then have pretty free access to get across to the brain. So kind of an interesting idea.",

            "transcript": "Well, the I mean the antigens could be coming from either direction, either from there there's circulation to the meninges and on the Venus side that's where it's highly fenestrated. So you can have antigens from gut entering circulation and then sensitizing these cells in the meninges or you can have like in the case of stroke or brain damage, you can have antigens coming from the parenchyma as well uh across the meninges and setting off the immune cascade there.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, so the migration of IGA plasma blast from the gut going far away it's very hard to track. We worked a lot on IGA and uh I kind of limit the work actually to the gut because it was very hard to really because IGA plasma blasts are different and they produce uh you know just monomeric IGA if you if you have antigen going actually systemic and and uh and uh priming them. So that's where I don't know what what uh what is the way to track them from the gut to the brain.",

            "transcript": "Um all that I can say to that I guess is the evidence that that I'm familiar with is so in the same animal they've uh done B cell receptor sequencing in the in the gut as well as in these areas in the meninges and shown that there's uh very high similarity or co-occurrence of the same receptor uh in both sites that statistically shouldn't be occurring um unless these plasma cells were actually migrating uh from gut to to these meningial areas.",

            "transcript": "I have a unrelated question. Um so from the standpoint of developing models that would help the field, um where do you think are like do we have some good ideas around what factors could be triggering the leaky bear like the leaking from barriers and we're just trying to drill down on the mechanisms of how that happens or are we in the phase where we're like we should be screening for a larger set of molecules or metabolites or factors that could be coming from the microbiome. I'm trying to think if we need some sort of scalable model in order to search for more of those or models that would help us like you know interrogate specific things mechanistically on a more complex level. Uh maybe the answer is both so I'd love to hear from all of you at that.",

But a lot of proteases um are are metal dependent, right? So are there bacteria that are I I know for example, um E coli Nissle is um heightens that niche defense because it has a tons of iron transporters. Basically sucks up all of the iron. And so other organism which is limiting so other organisms are not allowed to use it. Um but zinc and calcium and other, you know, cat ions are often a part of these metallo or matrix metallo proteases. Um and so one like even lower than the sort of organic metabolite level is like what's the ion composition um there and is that something that could provide as as as Faranak said, uh a more mechanistic understanding.",
