   "transcript": "So so in humans, there are direct correlations. So we went after some of those genetically, right? So you go actually and you target pathways that are involved in uh in tight junction and uh in pathways that are indirectly actually uh correlated to barriers. And that uh and then if you have actually microbial trigger, you can affect directly the uh blood brain barrier. So uh the question now is uh so so once you come up uh come up with a driver and then a trigger, the question is like uh to what extent it's uh it's really affected and then uh if that will leave lead to uh any physiology. So that's something that we are trying to explore and like how big is that uh change and you can go with different particles and so on, you can figure out uh what size molecules can actually get into the brain, right? Which is important as well. So I I couldn't find I couldn't find very much a lot of work on that. Uh so so we had to design some systems but uh but I'm I'm looking actively to find good work in that area and to kind of follow up uh so if you guys because we are very new, you know, I worked a lot on the gut barrier but not the blood brain barrier. So we are applying a lot of knowledge like that.",

I mean, in a sense, if you have inflammatory mediators that are within the bloodstream, they could impact the endothelium and create leakiness that would be independent of the size of the molecule because once you've broken down the barrier then large molecules can pass too.",

So it's very hard to model both in an in vitro system. That's why we went for the in vivo system. So we want to see if an effect in one or two is happening and so on. So that's how we couldn't that's why if there is a system to do that in vitro that will be fantastic.",

   "transcript": "There's actually an interesting system involving focused ultrasound that you can use to temporarily change the brain uh the CNS barriers. Uh so the blood brain barrier where you can uh the focused ultrasound will cause a temporal gap in the blood brain barrier that allows passage over the span of say 30 seconds and then you can close it again. And so so that would allow you to at least isolate that barrier separate from the intestinal barrier. Um just a thought.",

And uh you know, there was this group in Harvard that came with another one as well. So so now now we have molecules where we can modulate that. But uh if it's a genetic defect, how that affects one versus the other barrier and is there a genetic selectivity where that will happen and then basically the microbial or any trigger will affect one versus the other or both. Uh I don't know. I'm I'm putting it very complex here, but uh but those are probably happening simultaneously or in some individuals one is more uh because the the gut barrier you need like epithelial uh integrity and uh in the blood brain barrier you need endothelial integrity as well. So that's where uh you know, the signaling that is uh regulating both uh is different. So the genetic susceptibilities that are affecting one or the other might be different or the same. So how how to put all those factors together uh and then come up with a trigger and model that in order to get to the right model finally.",
