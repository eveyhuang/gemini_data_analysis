Do you think that these guys are keen to fund that kind of thing or like hypothesis generation, which would be too risky for NIH or do you think that they're more translationally focused on that?

The and I I can you can provide that on your surveys as a comment that it would be helpful to get some feedback on your proposals so they know what you're they're looking for, right? And I can provide that too since I heard it from you, but my guess is that the the idea of this is to get funding that NIH wouldn't fund funded, you know, or get you started.

And and and I also want to mention because I'm a reviewer at NIH that one of the challenges at NIH is that right now microbiome is everywhere. So what they do is you send a proposal that has some microbiome component, they send it to a panel that is investigating, I'm going to put aging as an example, okay? So aging and the microbiome. So they send it to an aging panel where no one there knows about the microbiome, but they call someone like Rosie to be the microbiome expert. And no matter how much Rosie likes that proposal, there's other reviewers that don't maybe don't appreciate the value of the microbiome.
