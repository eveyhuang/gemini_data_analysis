Something I see as long lasting, yes, and is it the same or does it change over time? Yes, the issue of the time is also important. But you are thinking on the right in the right way.

Um, so I know there's a few like cited kind like aptimer based sensors that people have tried to develop. I don't it's not really well developed though, but in terms of miniaturizing existing technologies, I don't know.
