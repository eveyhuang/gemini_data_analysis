Like the the the most perfect replication you can get of that study. You can do that even with really small studies by doing a leave one out analysis where you build the model from nine of 10 samples and then you predict with that 10th sample and then just kind of round robin it.

Like the the the most perfect replication you can get of that study. You can do that even with really small studies by doing a leave one out analysis where you build the model from nine of 10 samples and then you predict with that 10th sample and then just kind of round robin it.
