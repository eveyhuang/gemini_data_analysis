So it seems it will be useful to do a global metabo metabolite profiling of the gut microbiome, oral microbiome or just anything surrounding you. And then going one step further is that to me, I feel that for for mechanism, we we mechanism and causal relationship, we want to focus on metabolite that can enter the human bloodstream. So it will be useful to do the metabolomics of the blood sample or maybe other human sample, overlap those like uh microbial metabolomic and and blood metabolomics and then focus on those that overlap with the the tools suggesting that microbial metabolite can enter bloodstream and potentially. So those metabolite may be the most interesting one. And building those library will be useful for future study, like for people that uh help people identify specific uh metabolite in the future.",
