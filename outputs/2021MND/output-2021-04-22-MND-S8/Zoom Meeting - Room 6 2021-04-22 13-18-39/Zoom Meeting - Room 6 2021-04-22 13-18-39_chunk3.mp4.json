Uh, and so I think that's kind of where we're at right now in terms of the like, okay, we have a lot of we have a bacterial correlation and some bacterial population. We know their genomes, at least the ones that we can, you know, sequence. Uh, so we know a lot of things about genomes. And so we can use metagenomic analysis to calculate what those bacteria might be producing and then go from there, but that I think is we're not there yet, I don't think in terms of predicting a metabolome based on a microbiome, um, uh, I mean, you can you can start, right? And then and then now it's a field for analytical chemists to say, okay, I know when I have to get something, you know, if I want to go to the metabolomics facility, I have to know what I'm looking for, right?",

            "transcript": "That's true, but here, let me give you, uh, I'll tell you about our approach because we do completely untargeted work. So, um, when we analyze the a metabolome, we might have a decent idea of the identities of 5% of the features that we can detect in a sample. But that doesn't stop us. We're not going to only focus on the 5% we can name. We take all of those features and we look for, do these, which of these features correlate with disease? And then the next step is, beyond correlation, which of these features predict disease in a new cohort? If they check out, then we'll do the work to find out what that feature is. But even if we never know what it is, we can describe it. We can say under these conditions, we're going to see it with this mass at this set of retention times and that's still information. Um, so it's just like knowing a gene sequence even though you don't know what that gene does. You don't have to know what the metabolite is for it to be a predictive biomarker so long as you can reliably measure it and you know from sample to sample, this mystery factor X, I know where it's at, I can pick it out and I can measure it. That's all that's really required.",

And how does that then affect how you find whether there even would be common ones because of the scale of interindividual diversity.",
