See basically what's the earliest you can get, uh, uh, yeah, get a signal, um, uh, from those populations.",

And so that presents a challenge but also an opportunity to set up systems that will fund research that can really span an entire lifetime and um and and also here, you know, the study design becomes really important of course because you you want to be uh following people for a really long time so that some of these microbiota effects can become uh evident.

So I think the more irons you have in the fire and finding something that eventually is sensitive specific but also easily implementable is the ideal.",
