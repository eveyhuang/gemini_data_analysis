Um but uh my lab will be working on sort of precision medicine approaches to understanding neurodevelopmental disorders. Um like using machine learning applied to big data. Um I think I'm here because my PhD work was in the neuroscience of the gut, the enteric nervous system. And so I have this fantasy of, you know, my early 20s work and the work I do now maybe coming together. So it's been really interesting to hear about what all of you very smart people are doing. Um and uh yeah, I think that's about it. I I'm really interested to see how if there's any links from the microbiome being able to actually help my patients. So, yeah.",

So the research in my lab we focus on developing nanometer scale uh neurotransmitter sensing probes that can probe the dynamics of neurotransmission with fast response time. So at the time skill of the occurrence of the neurotransmission. So we also developing uh platforms that can probe different kinds of neurotransmission like chemical transmission as well as electrical transmission. And the third focus is to probe multiple groups of uh small neurotransmitter molecules as well. So for example like in neurodegeneration, it all often like involves more than one kind of neurotransmitter. So, yeah, so we are very interested in Alzheimer's disease like neurodegeneration in general. So nice to meet you all.",

My lab studies chemistry of the microbiome and I'm really excited by all of the summaries everyone's giving here. I'm like frantically taking notes of people I want to follow up with. Um just a snippet of what we kind of do in the in the intersection of microbiome and neurobiology. We're looking at the role of gut bacteria in causing alpha synuclein aggregation in the gut. We know that alpha synuclein the alpha synuclein aggregates are involved Parkinson's disease. Those aggregates um there's a lot of evidence suggesting that they originate in the gut before they um end up in the brain and they get there through the vagus nerve. We're studying the role of dopamine and iron, specifically iron speciation um in the gut um in order to actually um sort of map how how alpha synuclein happens and which bacteria are involved and what the specific chemical environment is. So I'm excited to talk with all of you more.",
