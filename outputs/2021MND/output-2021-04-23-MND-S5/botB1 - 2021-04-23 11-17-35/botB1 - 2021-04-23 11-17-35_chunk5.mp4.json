I'm wondering actually, Amina, do you want to based on maybe anything you wrote down earlier or just your thoughts on how your own work might tie in? Do you want to share anything?",

So when you have a system that function and there are things are produced within the system, which we call like kind of like gross rates, right? Things are just happening within the systems and it doesn't really affect the net output. So, um, you you have your your microbiome any other system and you're exposing it to food and environmental conditions and there are things happening within it, but that necessarily doesn't affect the outside world. But then you have a set of outputs that are the ones that you're actually looking at as your biomarkers that would potentially impact something else in the organism.",

So how does the microbiome uh either changes following exposure to all these cocktails of contaminants that we are adding to the environment that humans are now exposed to that they weren't exposed to. And how does this microbiome both changes as a results of that, um, in fact in fact development and uh, and then the other way around too, how does the microbiome changes those contaminants and what is the output um compounds from that and then how do these impact uh the the health of the individual. So I think that the the way I'm the thing I'm thinking about is a little bit kind of feels like outside of what the discussion here it was going on about.",

Um there's this emerging appreciation for the um value of understanding the redox potential of the microbiome and um I'm interested Amina and like this is hard, right? I to measure actually redox potential of a complicated um uh community and it's usually highly variable. And I'm I'm wondering from your perspective as someone who like knows metals, um uh what how you think about measuring redox potential but more specifically speciation of metals within that environment because that really changes their activity. If they're like going wild or if they're just kind of like in the background and fine. And this can be I think one of these important um mediators of disease and I know it's so hard sometimes to measure speciation. I was just wondering kind of it like what what that looks like these days from the microbiome perspective.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, so I mean speciation is is the the problem, right? So it's like how can you maintain the conditions in which your sample is naturally present. This is something that we deal with when we work with sediment or seawater or any any type of matrix where a slight change in redox conditions just going to completely change the species of the metals that you're looking at. So it's not representative of of your sample. So I mean the trick is just to try to your best to work in the same conditions as so if you're like in anoxic environment, obviously you have to keep your your sample anoxic and um it's it's it's timing too, you have to be fast. You know, you can't let it sit around for two weeks before you do the measurements has to be done uh as soon as possible. So you try to mitigate, you know, a change in conditions in order to maintain that. Uh for the speciation itself, it really depends on which metals you're working with. I do a lot of um not redox speciation but um like which which uh compound speciation type work. So I work at different organometallic compounds.",
