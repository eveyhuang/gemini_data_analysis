Um, there's there's so many things that you can think about when you're talking about biological markers. Um but I think that those will become clear as we as we engage in this discussion. And so if questions come up for you, I would say pose them to the group and we'll try and answer them. Um, so maybe we can get started. Does anybody want to kick off the discussion with with what they think is um important, relevant, interesting.",

Uh I mean although I missed the previous discussion so I don't know what you guys have discussed already but so so the way we think about it about it in in in my lab here is we try to find individual signatures or biomarkers, specifically secondary metabolites that are produced by different bacteria from the microbiome and we try to diagno we try to detect them with different methods. So we have electrochemical methods and uh colorimetric methods. But that's how we try to do it. Um, it's not really looking at biomarkers of the whole microbiome but of specific bacteria that are that are critical within in terms of relative abundance uh with within the whole gut microbiome, skin microbiome and oral microbiome. So that's how we think about it but yeah.",

So so basically if you can have like a fecal sample or a or a sample from the gut, you could, you know, the idea is that you could using this electrochemical techniques, you could um you could see what's there. And and and to what extent to like to what extent each microbe is contributing to that community. So so I guess it would be more interesting more useful in that context, like ex vivo um context. I don't know how that would work in vivo. I mean there are ways of there there are ways of engineering uh wearables and pills that you can, you know, you can take orally and then uh they have the biosensors incorporated and and they can sense as they go through the GI tract um and report on what they're sensing. So that's a possibility. I mean this technology you can you can connect it via Bluetooth with a cell phone so that could be one thing that could be attempted but we have we haven't we haven't gotten to that yet.",

Like, you know, in vitro, in vivo, like yesterday, uh some topics being touched, right? you know, just by like um the experiments in uh test tube can give you some idea as well, right? So here, you know, what would be the ideal situation here? So should we also, you know, step start from like in vitro then move on to in vivo, right? That's like in vitro studies can also provide as much information as like in vivo studies. And it's not here everybody.",

To me, you start with the disease and you start with patient cohorts that have have that early stage disease and you start with screening those patients for give us a few hits, something that's either taxonomically or metabolically different or worth uh pursuing in those things. So to me it starts out with clean cohorts of patients. Um perhaps you choose a disease that has a fairly well defined early phenotype that you can detect it early. Um so some of what Elizabeth is doing with alpha for example. Um and then once you have that disease specific information, I think then you jump into models and you put those things in in mice or in dishes and try to manipulate from there. But as long as the question is directly tying to early stage neurological disease, there's so many caveats with models. I think you have to start with people and then go backwards. Just at least to me that makes more sense.",

Because in the in the cases of like the the assays that were proposed earlier, right? Those are specific assays for specific molecules. And so you have to in that case you would have some predefined hypothesis that those molecules would be markers of something as opposed to are you doing a true discovery based analysis where you're trying to find molecules that represent whether it's the microbial infection or the neurological disease. And then I would just propose to take that further, you know, um, and say that you have to consider also the fact of is it derived from the host or the bacterium and how do you address the fact that um many molecules have never been described before. So I think that um signatures matter, I think identities matter and I think that you have to decipher if you're going after a target or panel molecules or discovering new molecules.",

For example, the epithelial cell. How is that epithelial cell that's the the right hub to to process this metabolite and then what is the output of the epithelial cell. That will become the input for the neuronal cell. And many times the neuronal disease might generate they might share common mechanism. Um I study a little bit of the neuro degeneration before. I know for Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, their trafficking, the protein trafficking system has some defects. So I I feel those markers if it's somehow related to neurological disease, which I don't really know. Currently, based on literature, it seems like autism spectrum disorder, the ASD and some depression, uh even for Parkinson's disease I just heard from Elizabeth.",
