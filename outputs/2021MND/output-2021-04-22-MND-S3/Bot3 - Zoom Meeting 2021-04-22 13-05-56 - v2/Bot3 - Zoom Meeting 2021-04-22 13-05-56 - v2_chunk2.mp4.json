But, you know, coming from me working with mice, like building the really complicated organoid gut on a chip and multi-organ gut on a chip sounds really hard. And so I actually wonder if starting bottom up with just each single cell alone, with each single cell type alone with the effector might be also.",

And, and I do like the idea. I mean, I think this is really interesting space, but I do like the idea of working with metabolites or a single molecule because then you're not, your readouts aren't in a background of hundreds, if not thousands, of different molecules, most of which you're not even interested in. If there's an outcome of interest that most of you're not interested in. And so you're more likely to see defined effects and more specific effects that relate back to the in vitro system.",

Yeah, my colleague actually is also my collaborator already used this artificial intelligence approach to actually identify the top molecules based on the gut brain access or the communication. They can actually be identified the top 10 molecules. They are either small molecules or the chemical small molecules or actually derived from gut microbiome. So they can actually use that as a cocktail that if you identify 10 molecules based on their algorithm, then you can actually put as a group of this 10 molecules as a cocktail and then stimulate cells. I think about may actually narrow down the range that however, the question is when we use this molecule, we're going to use the human resources or all these mice resources. That is the key because I believe because we when we pass that, we do say that human cells and mouse cells show the different response. So that's is also the key.",

And every single model has a strength associated with it. Whether or not it's communication across tissues or the bulk of the metabolites or the bulk of the community. If you're interested in a single cell type, how does it respond, or a single receptor, how does it respond? I think it makes a lot more sense to work with mice because you can do cell type specific knockouts and throw that into your complicated multi-tissue system. And then, but you're still going to be missing something, probably. And so then you still have to go back to in vivo or take that to human stuff. So I think as long as, you know, the same way we approach every scientific question, this model has some benefits and some caveats, and we're just trying to synthesize everything afterwards.",
