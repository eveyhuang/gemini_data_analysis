Um but certain bacteria obviously those that are culturable and depending on their oxygen tolerance can be you know and obviously you can make anaerobic cultures right? You know it's it's surprising at least at least in terms of of theos many many of these cells live quite well under anaerobic conditions. So if you get the conditions right you can model some of the interaction but you won't be able to get all of it right? And it's certainly you know probably what Judith means right is that if you throw one bug let's say you get it to work right? You have a cell culture system that you're very proud of you can get it layers and all the connections right? And you have a bacteria that you add that. But again you know bacteria may behave very differently if it isn't you know if there's maybe some of these other partners that are just in the lab. You know again they're pieces of the puzzle. And so I think that maybe one of the the other way to look at it says you know that each of these systems alone are going to be sufficient.",

And so that's another thing where I guess the scale could be useful.
