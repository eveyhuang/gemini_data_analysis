In one last thing that you could do in some model systems uh the zebrafish in particular is you can actually if you look at young stages you can actually knock them sense them such a way that you can actually see them mess it up and that's a that's an advantage for um giving you ideas about the information flow in the process that then you could go back and tell in a mouse or organoid question.

So if you have the right cell types in there, they have more of a tendency to organize something that looks a lot more like the in vivo system than if you just have a few of the cell types. So, you know, I can I don't know if anybody's done it, but I can imagine making something where you have a lot of a lot of the cell types that you want and you've layered it on and you've think it's gone in the appropriate order and you could get something that maybe would self self-organize. So if you have the appropriate part of the brain you might might be able to get that kind of self-organization with the vagus nerve. But then the big question is, you know",
