Obviously that being related to the to the vaginal microbiome but also the gut, you know, sort of you're talking about the gastric microbiome, H pylori can thrive where lactobacilli would not, like they would die. So trying to think about what what ways we can use to study, I guess in a more high throughput way what the impact of different conditions on these different taxa are. Um might be one way to start to get a handle on this because I guess from what I'm what I'm gathering from the conversation is there are just so many different types of stress, so many different types of stress response that we're thinking about that we need to kind of start to define, okay, which ones do we want to look at, how do we look at them? Um which is all its own kind of question, like how do you define which which stress is the most important on a microbe. Oxidative stress seems like a reasonable place to start just based on leaky gut and what we know about oxidative stress and um metabolism, but I guess I'm trying to run through that.",

Either the disease or and the physiological condition in the people eat different foods and actually they they have in the gut inflammation, those could all create the all kinds of inflammation. Oxidative stress is one of them, I guess this one of common stressors to many things. Uh either this is the uh there's uh short chain amino acid break down and also fragmented polypeptide and mitochondria and all the bacteria changes bio fluid changes they all create the oxidative stress. But in I thought it's stress is really depends on the model we're studying, you know, if we're studying and the neurodegenerative disease and what the stress will be and uh in for the GI uh the GI disease and what the what stress we should actually study or focus. Uh that is what I thought, you know, we cannot include all the stressors to one model or one case, one case and I think this really really need to tailor which model we're going to use or what condition we're going to study.",

I think this one although since um can be actually understood in like reductive models because you would just want to look at how each micro um bion like each bacteria respond to different kind of stress. Um there must be a kind of sensor proteins or in the bacteria and that can sense the stress and then has a like intracellular signaling pathway, often times is a activation of transcription factors. So I feel these actually can be studied um in individual that in a really simple model model case. Of course um in I guess in the gut there's still much more complications. However, I think even in a lab space already we can draw so much more understanding about um how they respond to each stress.",
