If you want to target Clostridial species A, you would need some way to get the DNA just to that taxa and not to Clostridial species B. Um so you need some kind of phage. I know some groups are working on that. Um I can't remember where I saw a recent publication on it, but um loading CRISPR type systems into phage and using that to modify the gut microbiota, but that would also require some phage biology that I'm not sure how well that's that's understood in the gut.",

So it's same way we have different species of bacteria or different genus. So what works in E doesn't work in. Second is a lot of the traditional method rely on homologous combination and the selection is antibiotic resistance. So we just don't know what sort of antibiotic resistant profiles certain bacteria have once we have to grow them in the lab to do all of that and then we have to figure out which plasma can go in and which plasma for integrate and things like that. So those are the challenges. I this just needs more effort, more volume of effort. Like the initial E methods were developed using phages actually by and other people. Um and so, you know, people just need to be more motivated to do it.",
