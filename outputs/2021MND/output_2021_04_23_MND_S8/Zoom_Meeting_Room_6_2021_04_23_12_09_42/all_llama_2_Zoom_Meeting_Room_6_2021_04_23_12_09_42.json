So there there was relations basically. That's we call have studied these. And they involve these neurotransmitters or hormones. Um so uh if we have those signals, those values either in serum samples, um or something that is implanted, I don't know in brain and measures those values, everything in real time and then, you know, doing some modeling really see how whatever is happening here uh correlates to uh you know, changing in the gut microbiome.

But I I think that that's a relatively narrow segment of what we know about the microbiome. So it feels like if if money was not an object and like you could actually do what you wanted to do, it would be incredible where there was just more standardized like collection of cognitive or neurological data from, you know, all of the microbiome studies that are done because I think then you would start to be able to figure out exactly like what might some of these like species level interactions be that ultimately like have a bearing on things like yeah, like cognition and behavior.",
