Not so, yeah. Um, do you want to share something? Uh, Lawrence, sorry. I know it's uh, it's too much. I know, but um, you want to share before we continue the conversation. There was something else, Carolina also, um, didn't mention Young. Um, Young mentioned models, um, that he does because he's a physicist and he mentioned that when you do models, um, I'm going to try to summarize it, Young, but please, um, correct me, okay? So he said, there's two things that you could do. You could take transactional data or you could take longitudinal data. And um, you what you have to to know is the real abundance of of the members of the community, not relative abundance, which is one of the limitations of of the field, I would say, because that's some of the information that we have most commonly available, which is relative abundance. Um, but he can craft and model these interactions and come up with a homeostasis regardless of if you have cross-sectional data or longitudinal data, the key is to have real real amounts and not relative abundance.
