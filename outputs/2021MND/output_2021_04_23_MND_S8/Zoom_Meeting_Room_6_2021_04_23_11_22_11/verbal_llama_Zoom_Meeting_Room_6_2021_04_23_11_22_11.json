Or the the interaction can be modulated by the host immune system.

And uh if you are lucky and if you study a bacteria that can be really cultured in vitro, then of course you can use the textbook technique, right? You do the monoculture and coculture and then you calculate the relative yield and this will give you very um convincing result regarding the inter species interactions.

In a sense that the the signal or the time series has to be basically crazy enough.

And uh in reality, you know, at least for human gut microbiome, we know that for healthy adults, if you don't change your diet drastically, if you don't take too much antibiotics, our microbiome is so stable and the temporal uh fluctuation doesn't mean any real ecological dynamics.

What does this mean? This just mean the real time series is just like a random uh um random shuffle time series. Okay. So that's one approach. As long as you have very informative time series data, you can rely on very standard system identification technique to infer the inter species interaction. But if you don't have time series data, you can still rely on cross section data. As long as you assume the cross section data roughly represent the static samples of the the complex ecosystem and we have developed method to infer the inter species interactions from cross section data. And the basic idea is that as long as you have two static samples, as long as they have uh one common species, then the difference between the two steady states somehow encode the inter species interactions. So in this case, as long as you collect enough static samples, then we can basically infer the inter species interactions. The only caveat is that we need a super abundance.

It in my opinion, I think it comes from the the uh entirety of the system and I have a lot of doubts as to whether that complexity can be derived ground up because it seems like when you put two players in, you get some very specific interactions that may or may not have any bearing on what you get when you have 100 players.

I guess we can start by saying there's top down and down to top, but we can maybe summarize it and um, yeah. I mentioned this yesterday, not today, but I I I believe strongly that microbes react to their environment and they can also change their environment and this makes the question, of course, a more complex one. And so you if you introduce a probiotic, for example, that will go to the gut, but will not graft and not change the environment, nothing really happened, right? But if you somehow manage to change that environment, the microbiota will change. Um, and so, um, I'll I'll give you two examples from my research. One, we did a study where we look at um, the gut microbiota after gastric bypass surgery. And this this was my introduction to the gut microbiome world and um, the changes after gastric bypass surgery are so drastic that with the three patients, we were able to get statistical significance. And you know how hard that is in the microbiome world. ",

There's a pH and there's also when you do gastric bypass surgery, you bypass the stomach, which is a filter for microbes, you know, the stomach has a very high pH and it's a filter for microbes. So we also ended up when we repeated this in a longitudinal way, we found an increase of microbes that are microbes normally found in the mouth, which makes sense because now they can go through, right? And they can make it to the gut. Uh, but I am sure the gut environment changed dramatically. Um, and also the substrate as as Lawrence mentioned, uh, the substrate changes because now you bypass the the gastric acid, so the way that the gut is receiving the nutrients is it's a different shape of nutrients.
