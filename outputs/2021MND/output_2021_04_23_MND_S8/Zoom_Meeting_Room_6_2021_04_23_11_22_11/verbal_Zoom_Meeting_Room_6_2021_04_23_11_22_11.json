And so like um like um Ida was mentioning earlier too or suggesting like things like redox, right? If like the redox is really off and there's a lot of oxygen in the environment, you don't really have to know the interspecies interactions to know something bad is probably about to happen. And so I guess then it comes down to as Carlino's saying on the other part, like what do you, where do you actually have to get the community to go or to actually do? I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm relatively optimistic that on the front end that you could predict somehow or you you um given at least like some environmental parameters what the community is going to do even if you don't know exactly which bugs are going to do it.

And just by changing the glycobiology of the mucus, it changes which microbes can then compete. So it's the host response, not even talking about inflammation, but it's changing the physical environment that those microbes are now interacting in. So I think with all of this, like and I said this in the session that we were in yesterday, these are all really big questions. So whatever we're doing, we're there's going to be a specific question that your research interest is guiding towards and that's going to change or that's going to affect your ideal approach to answering said question. And I think we all have to have like a very agnostic view of this is the the question, this is the approach that they took and now we all have a responsibility to try and synthesize that to give us some information on interspecies interactions and then how that's going to affect gut brain.
