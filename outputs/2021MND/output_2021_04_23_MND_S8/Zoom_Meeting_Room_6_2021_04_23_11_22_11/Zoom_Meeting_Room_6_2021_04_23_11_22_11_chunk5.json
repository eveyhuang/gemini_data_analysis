I guess we can start by saying there's top down and down to top, but we can maybe summarize it and um, yeah. I mentioned this yesterday, not today, but I I I believe strongly that microbes react to their environment and they can also change their environment and this makes the question, of course, a more complex one. And so you if you introduce a probiotic, for example, that will go to the gut, but will not graft and not change the environment, nothing really happened, right? But if you somehow manage to change that environment, the microbiota will change. Um, and so, um, I'll I'll give you two examples from my research. One, we did a study where we look at um, the gut microbiota after gastric bypass surgery. And this this was my introduction to the gut microbiome world and um, the changes after gastric bypass surgery are so drastic that with the three patients, we were able to get statistical significance. And you know how hard that is in the microbiome world.",

Um, yeah. So there's there yeah, there's two things. There's a pH and there's also when you do gastric bypass surgery, you bypass the stomach, which is a filter for microbes, you know, the stomach has a very high pH and it's a filter for microbes. So we also ended up when we repeated this in a longitudinal way, we found an increase of microbes that are microbes normally found in the mouth, which makes sense because now they can go through, right? And they can make it to the gut. Uh, but I am sure the gut environment changed dramatically. Um, and also the substrate as as Lawrence mentioned, uh, the substrate changes because now you bypass the the gastric acid, so the way that the gut is receiving the nutrients is it's a different shape of nutrients.",

And I think, um, you know, I think there's certain research projects that are sometimes bound with the um academia in general and so this could potentially be a way to envision what type of project or ideas you haven't even thought about.
