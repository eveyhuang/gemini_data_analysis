And then lastly we were talking about what happens when you introduce a new member and does it matter that you're introducing a new species versus introducing a new function? Does does one or the two things matter more? And then Rosa was talking about pathogens and how we can leverage you know the destruction that they cause as a way to answering this question.",

I asked about pathogens because when they introduce themselves, I heard pathogens a few times, uh, not because I'm specially interested in pathogens, but I was trying to tap into your expertise or what you said you do. Not so, yeah. Um, do you want to share something? Uh, Lawrence, sorry. I know it's uh, it's too much. I know, but um, you want to share before we continue the conversation. There was something else, Carolina also, um, didn't mention Young. Um, Young mentioned models, um, that he does because he's a physicist and he mentioned that when you do models, um, I'm going to try to summarize it, Young, but please, um, correct me, okay? So he said, there's two things that you could do. You could take transactional data or you could take longitudinal data. And um, you what you have to to know is the real abundance of of the members of the community, not relative abundance, which is one of the limitations of of the field, I would say, because that's some of the information that we have most commonly available, which is relative abundance. Um, but he can craft and model these interactions and come up with a homeostasis regardless of if you have cross-sectional data or longitudinal data, the key is to have real real amounts and not relative abundance. Did I summarize it well, Young, or do you want to add something else? Can we put that as a bullet point also, Carolina?",

Um, so we we develop variable platforms also to monitor um the physical state or health of the patient, the the host as well, the human or other, I don't know, animal for example. So variable technologies and diagnostics by sensors that uh they can do real time monitoring. Uh, so yesterday it was mentioned like uh in some of the groups, I don't remember which one, uh that uh this could be uh like, you know, imagine we have like a smart peel, um, that it can actually monitor different things. Of course, it's not going to be in the level that the genomics or these metabolomics analysis they do, but uh that's could be actually very useful because it is not as specific as all those genomics data are because they are too big. So really to get what is what and where it it comes from, it is going to be, you know, we have a pool of everything basically from what I understand. So having like, you know, more systemic or systemic behavior of here is how the redox changes. Here is how, I don't know, pH changes. Here is how uh growth of the whole population or a specific population uh changes here versus, you know, another location. These are some of the things that, you know, we can make sensors, miniaturize sensors uh in micro micrometer range, small chips that they can be either on the body or inside uh to to sample and monitor.",

And so that if you want to understand it from like a like a taxonomic or an evolutionary level, I think things things often tend to compete for the same thing when they are more closely related. But there isn't that much variation maybe at like the I guess there can be variation at the strain level, but I think for all intents and purposes, right?

So Young Lou's Young Lou's approach of this sort of top down like let's take a look at everything that's there and so models and then there's also the reductionist view of let's put one thing together at a time and get really detailed um mechanisms of how these two interact and then we can add more things on top of that and add more things on top of that. So which way you want to approach it to try and get to painting a picture of ecological interactions. And I think what's interesting about that and and maybe Carolina knows this better than I do, but like that suggests, right, that like conflict or competition might actually be underlying homeostasis and that when you um perturb that and it breaks down, that actually that's how you lose it.",

That so maybe too hard to do on a personal level or like an on a personalized medicine type of level to understand like how these communities are varying once we add an individual member. But do we actually need to know that level of detail for being predictive about gut brain interactions? And I guess I I I would argue we probably do not need to go at that final level and I can from the perspective of I I would like to be able to tell that level from just for for for the interest of this evolution evolutionary dynamics and ecological dynamics. But I I um and I don't know very much about this field so anyone that please chime in from the perspective of uh the what ends up actually uh going to the brain or being sensed by the brain. I imagine it is more of a a time average uh mixture of metabolites that make it into the serum that then make it into the brain.
