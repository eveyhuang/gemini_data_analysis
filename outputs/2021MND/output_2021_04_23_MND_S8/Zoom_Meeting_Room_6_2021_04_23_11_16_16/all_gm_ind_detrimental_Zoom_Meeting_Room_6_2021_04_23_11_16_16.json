Okay, so, um, what I want to do is I want you to take a minute to think about the questions and to maybe write it down before we discuss. And what I did yesterday is I put it on the chat and even though my other facilitators said I didn't have to do it because you've seen the question. Here it is. I'm just trying to put it right there for you so you can see the questions on the chat. I know you have the document also.",
