You know, those are kind of uh, you know, produced in the gut as well, but also can be stimulated for production by the gut microbiome.

Uh looking at the transcriptomics in in the um uh through in our case we're interested in immune system so looking at the the peripheral blood mononuclear cells, um, looking at the metabolome uh from the in the blood because that's a kind of uh uh a measuring looking at some of the the targeted metabolites um that are the the the functional readout of the gut bacterial function. Um and and and and then then applied um network approaches to reduce the dimensionality of the testing and then look for um uh association that can give us a hypothesis that we can test for example, um, you know, does short chain fatty acid shift the peripheral immune system in certain direction then therefore increase the risk for for certain neuroinflammatory disease as as a as a a testable hypothesis.",

So kind of what our lab does is um, you know, for example, I'll take uh I'll use metabolomics for example. I mean, like I said before, metabolon gives us a a thousand features that are annotated. Thousands, you know, it's a lot and um, you know, not compared to like RNA, you know, not as much as RNA seek, but still a thousand is a lot. So what we do is if you actually use biological prior knowledge, um, those 1,000 different um metabolites can actually can actually be mapped down to like 50 or 60 or so, you know, biochemical pathways. Um, so I guess then the what you're leading to is, okay, man, I I started with a thousand features, but then you could really boil them down using biochemical annotations that's been around since the 40s, 50s or whenever, um, we only need to look at certain active, you know, biologi metabolic pathways, um, such as um, you know, like if you have a tryptamine, you know, what are all the tryptamine uh uh derivatives?

And then we had this microstructural change over here and that's due to, you know, bifidobacterium in the gut. And make those statistical associations between gut microbial populations in the brain.

        "transcript": "this is a maybe slightly off topic and I promise I'll connect it back. So give me give me one moment of indulgence. A classic problem in neuroscience has been to look at like for example a neuron deep in the visual cortex, like an area of V4 and figure out what it is about the visual scene that makes the neuron spike. And basically forever neuroscientists were hindered by the fact that you can only get a limited number of observational data of like when that neuron spikes paired with the images that were presented to the animal. And there's a a huge um universe of different visual features that it could have been and there's a lot of non linearities between them. And it was basically impossible. Really recently like the past couple years work from my lab and others solved that. And what we did is we just trained deep neural nets to take an images and predict when the neuron's going to spike. So you take the the data of the image and the spikes, uh train your neural net to to predict when the neuron's going to spike. And then once you do that, we can invert that process. So we can synthesize a bunch of images that are predicted to drive high firing rates in the neuron. That tells us what the neuron uh responds to and of course if you then you can validate that by showing those images to the animal and verifying that you do get the predicted firing rates out. So I wonder if if a sort of data driven scheme like that of, you know, taking microbiome observations, predicting uh disease states or pathologies and then inverting those predictors might also help in this case uh similar to the way it does in in um neuroscience. That's more an approach than a organ systems comment, but",

I have like a bit of a peripheral interest in kind of pans, like the pediatric acute onset neuropsychiatric system or pandas.

I think I think for me the big themes that came out of it were that I mean, what isn't? I thought that was a really interesting question. You know, like what isn't? And that this um you know, this whole idea of the systems is is very, very complex. And like you're right, okay, so we're studying the vaginal mucosa, you know, what what parts do you need? Or do you need the whole organism to actually study that? So I think some of the big picture stuff is that, you know, this is very complex and I I love the idea that, you know, we need um, you know, new technologies like machine learning, artificial intelligence to help us uh understand and um make sense of this data because again, it's it's a bit hard to do some of this hypothesis driven um methodology. Um I think as opposed to saying like, okay, what what is the data that's there and then can we try to understand that um better.
