A classic problem in neuroscience has been to look at like for example a neuron deep in the visual cortex, like an area of V4 and figure out what it is about the visual scene that makes the neuron spike. And basically forever neuroscientists were hindered by the fact that you can only get a limited number of observational data of like when that neuron spikes paired with the images that were presented to the animal. And there's a a huge um universe of different visual features that it could have been and there's a lot of non linearities between them. And it was basically impossible. Really recently like the past couple years work from my lab and others solved that. And what we did is we just trained deep neural nets to take an images and predict when the neuron's going to spike. So you take the the data of the image and the spikes, uh train your neural net to to predict when the neuron's going to spike. And then once you do that, we can invert that process. So we can synthesize a bunch of images that are predicted to drive high firing rates in the neuron. That tells us what the neuron uh responds to and of course if you then you can validate that by showing those images to the animal and verifying that you do get the predicted firing rates out. So I wonder if if a sort of data driven scheme like that of, you know, taking microbiome observations, predicting uh disease states or pathologies and then inverting those predictors might also help in this case uh similar to the way it does in in um neuroscience.
