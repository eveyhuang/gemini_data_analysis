But I think even, you know, at a higher level sort of um, when you have so much noise uh in in the human gut microbiome. So if you look at individual and individual change uh over time, that using that same person but at different time points as as sort of the um, the the comparators that that can give you some idea if you can correlate that with clinical outcome whether that's the onset of a disease or other intermediate phenotypes such as changes in the metabolome in the blood, etc. So that give you some sort of temporal having that temporal component uh give you some sort of uh, you know, not just association but maybe give you some sort of causal effect if you will.
