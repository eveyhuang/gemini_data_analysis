I mean, brain images of like maybe possibly areas where depending on a microbiome, what areas light up in a particular patient. I I I don't I'm very ignorant about how brain imaging works, but I know people have started, you know, some of the recent Alzheimer's papers that I've just, you know, just reading just out of pure interest. I mean, they do FM yeah, uh FMRI imaging, see what areas light up and does that have any statistical correlates with um, you know, gut microbiome features or other features in the blood. Um, so.",

So we had like, I think four or five different groups. And then we quantitatively imaged the brains of those mice and essentially we did um, and Joel and Jay, I know love this. You just basically it's like a large data set problem and you just basically mash them together. So we did uh, we did a K fold uh validation, uh random forest supervised learning study and we're able to show that, you know, certain areas of the brain where we saw structural change, we could actually say that's because we had this Roseburia here in the gut. And then we had this microstructural change over here and that's due to, you know, bifidobacterium in the gut. And make those statistical associations between gut microbial populations in the brain. The the problem with that as you know is these are pure statistical associations and the actual biology is a little bit opaque, like why do we see that? So it's hard to validate uh those sort of studies.",

            "transcript": "this is a maybe slightly off topic and I promise I'll connect it back. So give me give me one moment of indulgence. A classic problem in neuroscience has been to look at like for example a neuron deep in the visual cortex, like an area of V4 and figure out what it is about the visual scene that makes the neuron spike. And basically forever neuroscientists were hindered by the fact that you can only get a limited number of observational data of like when that neuron spikes paired with the images that were presented to the animal. And there's a a huge um universe of different visual features that it could have been and there's a lot of non linearities between them. And it was basically impossible. Really recently like the past couple years work from my lab and others solved that. And what we did is we just trained deep neural nets to take an images and predict when the neuron's going to spike. So you take the the data of the image and the spikes, uh train your neural net to to predict when the neuron's going to spike. And then once you do that, we can invert that process. So we can synthesize a bunch of images that are predicted to drive high firing rates in the neuron. That tells us what the neuron uh responds to and of course if you then you can validate that by showing those images to the animal and verifying that you do get the predicted firing rates out. So I wonder if if a sort of data driven scheme like that of, you know, taking microbiome observations, predicting uh disease states or pathologies and then inverting those predictors might also help in this case uh similar to the way it does in in um neuroscience. That's more an approach than a organ systems comment, but",
