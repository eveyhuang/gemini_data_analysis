Um, and I don't work on the gut or the microbiome at all.

Um, and our context are um aging um um different pain states uh and and diet. So not quite microbiome either, but I can I have some small inlets of interest in in there. So um super excited about similar things um why how I can contribute to, you know, the greater microbiome cause, etc. So.",

So my lab wrote some software that infers the patient's behavioral state from the electrical signals recorded in the implanted devices.

I'm a developmental pediatrician in training. Um, I was recently offered a clinician scientist position at the University of Calgary. Um, start date getting started out. Um, but my research focuses on precision medicine for developmental pediatrics. So, um, using precision medicine approaches like machine learning to better understand neurodevelopmental conditions, um, in children with neurodevelopmental conditions, essentially um applied to big data. Um, so this would include children with autism, intellectual disability, that sort of thing. Um, I think I'm here because my PhD, which is well before all my clinical training was in the neuroscience of the gut and the enteric nervous system and so, um, I have this I have this fantasy to combine this very basic science work I did in my early 20s with what I do now seeing patients with neurodevelopmental conditions and seeing if some of the strategies um that are coming out of science these days might be able to help my patients with some of their conditions. So, yeah, I'm I'm excited to be here.",
