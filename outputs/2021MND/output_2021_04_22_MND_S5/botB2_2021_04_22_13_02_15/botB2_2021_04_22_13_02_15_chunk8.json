This is something I'll just say while we're waiting for everyone to be back in the room. One of the things we do is is a study of how new collaborations form and what happens at the meetings that help to lead that so that we can adjust the nature of the meeting. So we actually look at who's assigned in whose rooms and how you interact with one another and then track that over time to see who chooses to write proposals whether those proposals are funded and who ultimately publishes papers together. Um and so we have data now 10 years running on the way that Silog functions to generate new collaborations among people.",
