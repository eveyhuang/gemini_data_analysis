And you know, in terms of sort of um uh uh Wenjing back to your question about what kind of approaches people sort of take to the system. I I you know, obviously there are many ways. Um, so so some of the some of our approaches doing these different multiomic um uh data collection uh taking from the gut microbiome to generate from from the stool sample to generate the the genome data but looking at at uh not just at the community but at the functional level through based on sequencing. Uh looking at the transcriptomics in in the um uh through in our case we're interested in immune system so looking at the the peripheral blood mononuclear cells, um, looking at the metabolome uh from the in the blood because that's a kind of uh uh a measuring looking at some of the the targeted metabolites um that are the the the functional readout of the gut bacterial function. Um and and and and then then applied um network approaches to reduce the dimensionality of the testing and then look for um uh association that can give us a hypothesis that we can test for example, um, you know, does short chain fatty acid shift the peripheral immune system in certain direction then therefore increase the risk for for certain neuroinflammatory disease as as a as a a testable hypothesis.",

So like Joel is a Joel and Jay would know this is like, you know, a lot of these works when you have Omics, you invariably have this PN problem, right? Where the number of features you have way, way, way outstrip the number of replicas that you have. Um, you know, the the canonical way is to do exactly what Dr. Brian did, right? Is you have a hypothesis, you do the sort of the longitudinal well-designed experiment. Um, but that's the huge bottleneck, right? Is like there's really no way to sort of multiplex and model these gut microbiota uh brain interactions like how do you put these like on a 384 well plate? How do you throw these into like, you know, some sort of multiplexed highly efficient way to get higher end so that we can actually do the right studies that we want to do. Um, I would love if anybody has ideas on that because that's something I personally have been struggling with too.",

Once you go sort of to the extreme end of having way, way, way um high dimensional systems, things things actually work a little bit differently. So for example, you know, we train artificial neural nets for object recognition, they have millions of free parameters, um, and typically the data sets on which we train them are like thousands or hundreds of thousands of images. So you're, you know, in classical statistics, you're way under constrained, you basically just have to give up.",

I mean, yeah, in the ideal world if someone gives us like $100 million dollars to do like Omic studies on like a million people, that would be great, but that's not going to happen anytime soon. So kind of what our lab does is um, you know, for example, I'll take uh I'll use metabolomics for example. I mean, like I said before, metabolon gives us a a thousand features that are annotated. Thousands, you know, it's a lot and um, you know, not compared to like RNA, you know, not as much as RNA seek, but still a thousand is a lot. So what we do is if you actually use biological prior knowledge, um, those 1,000 different um metabolites can actually can actually be mapped down to like 50 or 60 or so, you know, biochemical pathways. Um, so I guess then the what you're leading to is, okay, man, I I started with a thousand features, but then you could really boil them down using biochemical annotations that's been around since the 40s, 50s or whenever, um, we only need to look at certain active, you know, biologi metabolic pathways, um, such as um, you know, like if you have a tryptamine, you know, what are all the tryptamine uh uh derivatives? Uh serotonin is one. Um, so you then you could link um like disparate uh metabolites into single pathways and then you'll be like, okay, I'm really reducing down the problem.",
