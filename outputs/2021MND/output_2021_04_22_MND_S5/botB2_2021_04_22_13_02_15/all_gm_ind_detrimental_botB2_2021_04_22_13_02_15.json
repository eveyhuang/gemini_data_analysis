And definitely when we do when we run the statistics, it's like, okay, like there is a lot majority of the peaks that are found to be significant in in the context of a particular, you know, case control study are unannotated. I mean, we know these are, you know, some of them may be junk or like, you know, adducts and stuff, but um these are like really important stuff and no one knows how to annotate them and as Stephanie was mentioning to, like it takes a long time.

Is like there's really no way to sort of multiplex and model these gut microbiota uh brain interactions like how do you put these like on a 384 well plate? How do you throw these into like, you know, some sort of multiplexed highly efficient way to get higher end so that we can actually do the right studies that we want to do.

Thousands, you know, it's a lot and um, you know, not compared to like RNA, you know, not as much as RNA seek, but still a thousand is a lot. So what we do is if you actually use biological prior knowledge, um, those 1,000 different um metabolites can actually can actually be mapped down to like 50 or 60 or so, you know, biochemical pathways. Um, so I guess then the what you're leading to is, okay, man, I I started with a thousand features, but then you could really boil them down using biochemical annotations that's been around since the 40s, 50s or whenever, um, we only need to look at certain active, you know, biologi metabolic pathways, um, such as um, you know, like if you have a tryptamine, you know, what are all the tryptamine uh uh derivatives?

        "transcript": "this is a maybe slightly off topic and I promise I'll connect it back. So give me give me one moment of indulgence. A classic problem in neuroscience has been to look at like for example a neuron deep in the visual cortex, like an area of V4 and figure out what it is about the visual scene that makes the neuron spike. And basically forever neuroscientists were hindered by the fact that you can only get a limited number of observational data of like when that neuron spikes paired with the images that were presented to the animal. And there's a a huge um universe of different visual features that it could have been and there's a lot of non linearities between them. And it was basically impossible. Really recently like the past couple years work from my lab and others solved that. And what we did is we just trained deep neural nets to take an images and predict when the neuron's going to spike. So you take the the data of the image and the spikes, uh train your neural net to to predict when the neuron's going to spike. And then once you do that, we can invert that process. So we can synthesize a bunch of images that are predicted to drive high firing rates in the neuron. That tells us what the neuron uh responds to and of course if you then you can validate that by showing those images to the animal and verifying that you do get the predicted firing rates out. So I wonder if if a sort of data driven scheme like that of, you know, taking microbiome observations, predicting uh disease states or pathologies and then inverting those predictors might also help in this case uh similar to the way it does in in um neuroscience. That's more an approach than a organ systems comment, but",

Um but we know that, you know, you could have spaghetti and meatballs for dinner and you'll have a totally different composition about 12 hours than you did beforehand. Um so then to Wingjin's question is like I think there's two major questions from that. One is how much significance do we assign the more uh more specific phylogenetic classifications.
