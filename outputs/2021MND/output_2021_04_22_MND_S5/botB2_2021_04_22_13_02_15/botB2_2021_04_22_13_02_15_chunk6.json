It really depends at what level of taxonomic analysis you're doing this at. So um so yes, like at at the class or order level, it's extremely stable after you're about three years old. Um but we know that, you know, you could have spaghetti and meatballs for dinner and you'll have a totally different composition about 12 hours than you did beforehand. Um so then to Wingjin's question is like I think there's two major questions from that. One is how much significance do we assign the more uh more specific phylogenetic classifications. And two um it really does matter how and when and where in the microbiome we're we're doing these these samplings and at what sort of level we're trying to make these correlations to.",

Systems that I think we haven't talked about sort of the inflammatory/hematologic like cytokine signaling and I think we even talked about some state dependent like you know, during a time of infection or inflammation or even an inflammatory state like obesity, which is an inflammatory state. Um um or like in a fasted state or um, you know, post infectious, post antibiotic. I have like a bit of a peripheral interest in kind of pans, like the pediatric acute onset neuropsychiatric system or pandas. Um and uh you know, some of some people believe it's whoha, but I think there is some interesting evidence in that and so that always makes me wonder, you know, what happens in when the body is inflamed, um you know, and it can we know it can change the way the brain works.

I think I think for me the big themes that came out of it were that I mean, what isn't? I thought that was a really interesting question. You know, like what isn't? And that this um you know, this whole idea of the systems is is very, very complex. And like you're right, okay, so we're studying the vaginal mucosa, you know, what what parts do you need? Or do you need the whole organism to actually study that? So I think some of the big picture stuff is that, you know, this is very complex and I I love the idea that, you know, we need um, you know, new technologies like machine learning, artificial intelligence to help us uh understand and um make sense of this data because again, it's it's a bit hard to do some of this hypothesis driven um methodology. Um I think as opposed to saying like, okay, what what is the data that's there and then can we try to understand that um better.
