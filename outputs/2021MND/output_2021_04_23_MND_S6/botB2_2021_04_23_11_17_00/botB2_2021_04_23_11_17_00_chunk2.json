We're really interested in, uh, elucidating the biological transformations that are occurring in the brain that drive the actual quantitative imaging findings that we're finding on our imaging. Um, as a part of this process, uh, you know, we started to realize that we're having a lot of difficulty with, uh, both, uh, reproducibility and, you know, the rigor of a lot of the experiments that are out there. And we actually stumbled upon the fact that, uh, we're learning that the different gut microbial populations are really driving a lot of unexpected and unanticipated changes in the quantitative microstructure in the brain that we're all using. And so now, uh, the lab has taken a hard left turn and now we're really starting to examine how, uh, the gut microbiome is really influencing, uh, neural structural, neural functions. We're using both PET and MR technologies. Um, and really trying to basically reverse engineer imaging and try to figure out how, uh, these sort of genetic and environmental factors are driving the the factors that we're seeing, uh, in translational medical imaging.",

So we can see not just associations and the presence or absence of particular microbes, but actually enrichments and correlations with different aspects of disease severity, uh, things like the constipation phenotypes that happen in in these patient populations. Um, things like severity of the motor symptoms, uh, rapid. We don't quite have progression yet. Um, you know, PD is is a pretty long disorder that takes a long time to progress.

            "transcript": "Yeah, so maybe as like a a counterpoint to what Tim was doing, um, we actually go the opposite way. So we, you know, with, you know, our quantitative neuroimaging techniques, we can generate basically omics level type of data sets. And what we actually do then is we take, uh, 16S, uh, metagenomic data and using a lot of, uh, ML and DL type approaches, um, we basically look for statistical associations between, uh, microstructural changes occur in the brain and the sort of the frequency and prevalence of certain microbes that are in the gut. So whereas Tim is actually sort of, you know, I kind of think of it as like a bottom up approach, takes like the actual clinical sample and then tests it out and see what are what's associated with, uh, any of the other sort of output measures. Uh, we're going sort of backwards and I can find statistical associations. And I think there's, you know, benefits for both. Um, particularly for this, uh, this breakout session and I guess sort of just like this pie in the sky pitch that I've always had. Uh, so this is a potential project maybe is, um, since we're all sort of interested in neuroinflammation and ostensibly many of us are also interested in microglia. Um, you know, there's been some really good research coming out of like UCSF where they've taken plasma from, you know, aged patients and doing plasma transfers into young patients and backwards and forwards showing that you can rescue a lot of these aging phenotypes. And I would love to do the same thing with different microbial populations like in notobiotic mice, taking those plasma from those mice and in like, you know, a microfluidics or like a multiplex way look at how, you know, different plasma metabolites alter micro morphology, single cell seek, those types of things to really get at whether or not it's the metabolites that are driving it or is it the presence of gut microbiota or is it something in between that's really driving these neuroinflammatory changes that we're all seeing in the brain.",
