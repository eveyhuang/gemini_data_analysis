And now we suddenly know that there are all these other associated microbes with many, many more genes that are influencing the process from very early stages of development. And, uh, you know, it's it's cast a whole new light on the developmental process, and I'm someone who believes that the developmental process sets the organism up for the kinds of things that are going to happen later, such as the kinds of things that that, uh, Bob has talked about. And so we're, uh, in my lab also interested in interactions between the microbiome and other tissues, um, uh, and the nervous system. So in the gut, we look a lot at immune cells in the gut, and in the brain, we look at microglia, which are the resident immune cells in the brain.

And what we actually do then is we take, uh, 16S, uh, metagenomic data and using a lot of, uh, ML and DL type approaches, um, we basically look for statistical associations between, uh, microstructural changes occur in the brain and the sort of the frequency and prevalence of certain microbes that are in the gut. So whereas Tim is actually sort of, you know, I kind of think of it as like a bottom up approach, takes like the actual clinical sample and then tests it out and see what are what's associated with, uh, any of the other sort of output measures. Uh, we're going sort of backwards and I can find statistical associations. And I think there's, you know, benefits for both. Um, particularly for this, uh, this breakout session and I guess sort of just like this pie in the sky pitch that I've always had. Uh, so this is a potential project maybe is, um, since we're all sort of interested in neuroinflammation and ostensibly many of us are also interested in microglia. Um, you know, there's been some really good research coming out of like UCSF where they've taken plasma from, you know, aged patients and doing plasma transfers into young patients and backwards and forwards showing that you can rescue a lot of these aging phenotypes. And I would love to do the same thing with different microbial populations like in notobiotic mice, taking those plasma from those mice and in like, you know, a microfluidics or like a multiplex way look at how, you know, different plasma metabolites alter micro morphology, single cell seek, those types of things to really get at whether or not it's the metabolites that are driving it or is it the presence of gut microbiota or is it something in between that's really driving these neuroinflammatory changes that we're all seeing in the brain.
