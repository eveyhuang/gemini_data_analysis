And now we suddenly know that there are all these other associated microbes with many, many more genes that are influencing the process from very early stages of development. And, uh, you know, it's it's cast a whole new light on the developmental process, and I'm someone who believes that the developmental process sets the organism up for the kinds of things that are going to happen later, such as the kinds of things that that, uh, Bob has talked about. And so we're, uh, in my lab also interested in interactions between the microbiome and other tissues, um, uh, and the nervous system. So in the gut, we look a lot at immune cells in the gut, and in the brain, we look at microglia, which are the resident immune cells in the brain.

I was just um, so experiments that JP was talking about, um, so it wasn't with human, it wasn't with humans, it was actually with aged animals where they did this um, uh, kind of symbiotic approach where they, they um, they fuse two animals, a young animal and an aged animal together. Um, and saw that it was in fact the humoral components um, in the blood that influence microglia from, from, from aged animals. But the problem with that is, right, it could be not just the whatever's in the blood, cytokines, etcetera, it could be the fact that it's, you know, in aging the there's leakiness of the gut as well. So, um, so I think that's a really cool idea. That's that's what I wanted to say, JP. I think that's a great idea to do with humans. So.
