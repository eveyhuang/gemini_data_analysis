So that's kind of a cool thought that it is possible but you know, no one's ever shown it. So I think that's also a really cool idea potentially um for for a a grant idea. That's kind of far out there. But anyways, um the other yeah, so I was actually talking about this yesterday uh with a couple people that if you because we've done this taking out different um um sensory neuron populations and done some some sequencing and we see um depending on the disease state or pathological state that your sensory neurons can look like, you know, neurons or they can have signatures that look like immune cells and have upregulation of of a wide variety of different receptors that are typically um uh immune in in nature. We call it like topic immune expression. And then there's some there's this is already out um that in a high fat diet or during obesity the the neurons look like fat cells um where they're um have more leptin and they respond to more more more like um um metabolic um signatures in the gut. So yeah, and the cool thing about these sensory neurons in the periphery is that they they can they can do this because they're, you know, they're outside of the blood brain barrier and they're able to be influenced by the by stimulus outside stimuli outside of the the brain. So some interesting stuff.\",\n      \"speaking duration\": 102,\n      \"nods_others\": 0,\n      \"smile_self\": 0.0,\n      \"smile_other\": 0.0,\n      \"distracted_others\": 0,\n      \"hand_gesture\": \"Open Palms\",\n      \"interuption\": \"No\",\n      \"overlap\": \"No\",\n      \"screenshare\": \"No\",\n      \"screenshare_content\": \"None\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"speaker\": \"Laura Eisen\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"[03:45-04:18]\",\n      \"transcript\": \"The TLRs are expressed on many types of cells in the brain too, neurons, gleal cells, microgleal cells and other astrocytes in the brain that also express many of the same cytokines that are expressed by immune cells.
