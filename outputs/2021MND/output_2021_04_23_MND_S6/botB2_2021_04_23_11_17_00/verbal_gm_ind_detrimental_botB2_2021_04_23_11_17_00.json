And, uh, you know, it's it's cast a whole new light on the developmental process, and I'm someone who believes that the developmental process sets the organism up for the kinds of things that are going to happen later, such as the kinds of things that that, uh, Bob has talked about. And so we're, uh, in my lab also interested in interactions between the microbiome and other tissues, um, uh, and the nervous system.

Um something called uh like a neurogram if you will like for a particular cyto kind or particular microbe, which is one of my ideas actually for uh project is are there different um activation signatures um um in the Vegas for particular microbes that can give you an idea what's happening and how the brain is affected downstream and this is in the context of whatever disease state you want to think about, PD, AD. Um etc etc. Um because we know that for for a fact that that happens in the context of of particular cyto kind, TNF alpha, I1 beta, they have a particular um uh firing pattern if you will. ",
