And then uh the the idea of of um how that's what what the signal actually is once the cyto kind or the micro bind to to the a neuron, um they have a representation or electrophysiological representation or activity. Um something called uh like a neurogram if you will like for a particular cyto kind or particular microbe, which is one of my ideas actually for uh project is are there different um activation signatures um um in the Vegas for particular microbes that can give you an idea what's happening and how the brain is affected downstream and this is in the context of whatever disease state you want to think about, PD, AD. Um etc etc. Um because we know that for for a fact that that happens in the context of of particular cyto kind, TNF alpha, I1 beta, they have a particular um uh firing pattern if you will.",

Um yeah, so we do this um with mice and um definitely I think they're confounding effects and off target effects of antibiotics depending on which ones you use. And so um, you know, one idea is whether it would be useful um you know, for the particular experiment of interest to really stick with the nonabsorbable antibiotics. So um subsets of them like neocin, um I think vancin are thought to not be absorbed very well whereas other ones are absorbed very well and could have off target effects.",
