I'm interested in understanding how the nervous system gets wired up in the beginning. Um, and until a very few years ago, what developmental biologists knew was it's mom's genes and then it's your genes, at least when you're talking about vertebrates. And now we suddenly know that there are all these other associated microbes with many, many more genes that are influencing the process from very early stages of development. And, uh, you know, it's it's cast a whole new light on the developmental process, and I'm someone who believes that the developmental process sets the organism up for the kinds of things that are going to happen later, such as the kinds of things that that, uh, Bob has talked about. And so we're, uh, in my lab also interested in interactions between the microbiome and other tissues, um, uh, and the nervous system. So in the gut, we look a lot at immune cells in the gut, and in the brain, we look at microglia, which are the resident immune cells in the brain. I don't know the best way for people to introduce themselves because we probably all have, uh, each other in different places on our screens. So people could volunteer, and if they don't, uh, maybe we'll start calling on them.",

Uh, so this is a potential project maybe is, um, since we're all sort of interested in neuroinflammation and ostensibly many of us are also interested in microglia. Um, you know, there's been some really good research coming out of like UCSF where they've taken plasma from, you know, aged patients and doing plasma transfers into young patients and backwards and forwards showing that you can rescue a lot of these aging phenotypes. And I would love to do the same thing with different microbial populations like in notobiotic mice, taking those plasma from those mice and in like, you know, a microfluidics or like a multiplex way look at how, you know, different plasma metabolites alter micro morphology, single cell seek, those types of things to really get at whether or not it's the metabolites that are driving it or is it the presence of gut microbiota or is it something in between that's really driving these neuroinflammatory changes that we're all seeing in the brain.'"

We call it like topic immune expression. And then there's some there's this is already out um that in a high fat diet or during obesity the the neurons look like fat cells um where they're um have more leptin and they respond to more more more like um um metabolic um signatures in the gut. So yeah, and the cool thing about these sensory neurons in the periphery is that they they can they can do this because they're, you know, they're outside of the blood brain barrier and they're able to be influenced by the by stimulus outside stimuli outside of the the brain.",
