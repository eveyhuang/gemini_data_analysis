And so we've been doing sort of um qualitative research on what people do with those data and then how that might change their behavior and like say their diet and is it more motivation to like eat better the not to improve your own health but to improve the health of your microbiome.

And then that signal is propagated up the up the neuron. Um, and we can see this in the dorsal ganglion. I'm curious if that's if that happens um at the level of of the nodos. Um, because then that's a way that you can get a signal passing um directly from a metabolite, not not just a not just a neuron, right? But it could be from a microbe itself.",

Um and then for the optic side, I think there's I don't know examples of microbes, but there was a recent cool story on autoimmune inflammation that was T cell driven that required microbial antigens to like specific microbial antigens to be present in the gut. So these immune cells were being trained in the gut and then finding their target uh in in the nerve or in the in the retina. So there is possibility there.",
