I think what I what I would like to uh discuss in this group and interested in is um, you know, based based on our our interest and expertise in modulating specific cell types in animal models all the way to specific brain circuits in humans, how we can use these causal interrogation tools to manipulate uh the interaction along the gut brain axis and I think that's mostly the obvious one is the Vegas nerve uh where there's already quite some work done, but I'd be interested in chatting about if there other targets we could consider and also how we can use the cell type specificity we have with viral targeting strategy in animal models versus what we can do humans to kind of bridge that translational gap. So that's that's where my expertise and interest would then I think come in for that question. Not sure if that resonates with anyone or uh whether we can build something on that.
