Uh, so essentially you have uh you introduce receptors that respond to some kind of physical energy uh that or a chemical compound in some case and you can then manipulate neural excitability and use essentially the gene delivery strategy to achieve specificity in terms of cell types. But I'm not sure to what extent this has been done um in the enteric nervous system. I could definitely imagine the use of these techniques to in animal models obviously to to query kind of the top down control aspect of it. Whether that will I mean it it will probably modulate uh whatever the enteric nervous system is doing and then potentially as a secondary cause modulate the the gut microbiome. I think there are bigger questions about whether we can ever actually uh cut open all these feedback loops, but I I could imagine using such techniques to identify some of the top down electrical control if you will. And perhaps also bottom up by delivering gene delivery to the enteric nervous system and kind of deliver light or whatever energy there uh for the bottom up connections.",
