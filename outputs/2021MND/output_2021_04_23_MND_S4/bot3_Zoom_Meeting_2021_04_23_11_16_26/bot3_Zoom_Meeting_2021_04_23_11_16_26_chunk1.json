How can we understand interchangeable roles of neurons and immune cells? You know, I think this is quite interesting, right? Because you know, often times we think of cytokines as immune molecules and neurotransmitters as as molecules of the central nervous system. And I think they're just all signaling molecules, right? And I think what we have learned so far is that there are receptors and they're secreting these molecules, neurons and and immune cells, but I think a lot of the crosstalk still unknown, right? I think the cells have the capability of communicating, but what that communication is and what context they're operative in are still largely unknown.",

They're they're really in these at least again, what I've seen they're they're really in these artificial in vitro context, right? I'm not sure really what's going on in in in vivo. But you're absolutely right, no. And I think that the the data for sensing cytokines by neurons is both stronger and there's context, right?

We've been doing some work um where we are measuring neurotransmitter secretion in the lymph node. And so we're measuring uh you know, things like norepinephrin in real time in lymph organs. But right now we don't know exactly where it's coming from, you know, is it coming from immune cells or is it coming from the innervation of these sympathetic neurons there. Um so I think also to get at the question I guess about this interchange between them. There's also things like neural immune synapses um in immune organs um that are important for regulating immunity for things like gut inflammation.",

            "transcript": "I think going back to the previous comment of of expanding maybe our our thoughts and our report beyond just neurons, right? And and thinking about ancillary cells which both secrete and sense cytokines and they may be communicating with with neurons as opposed to let's say, you know, a cytokine may come from a macrophage or cytokine come from uh a microglia or or other gleal cells, right? Which which you know, in one way or another, you know, I think you know, the maybe the source of the cytokine though it's relevant is you know, as far as the neurons concerned, you know, it it's sensing the cytokine. So I think the looking at the role of these of these additional cells in both the central and the enteric nervous system is going to be important. So I think we should expand our our thoughts beyond just neurons.",
