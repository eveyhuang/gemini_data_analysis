They're they're really in these at least again, what I've seen they're they're really in these artificial in vitro context, right? I'm not sure really what's going on in in in vivo. But you're absolutely right, no. And I think that the the data for sensing cytokines by neurons is both stronger and there's context, right?

Um, and so I I think I guess to start on kind of the last question, to me one of the challenges of the organizations of the structures is to have compartmentalization in a way where you don't have signals from you know, the meta organism side of things that you don't have control over genomically evolutionarily, um, messing with your own evolution of of uh of tissue structures or cellular communication within the host.

Um, but again, you know, I'm not sure. you know, it may not be, you know, pro versus anti-inflammatory either, right? It just may be, you know, just signaling to the cell, right? I think the other concept that's really important which you know, I think to some degree we all do and and is is a fatal flaw in the way we do experiments, both immunologists and neuroscientists do is is that, you know, you take one side of kind and you throw it over an immune cell or neuron or whatever, right? But you know, it's not it's not in an organism, these cells are getting multiple signals at the same time. There's there's a few people systems biology who study these things, right? You know, who look at a particular cell type and, you know, we use reductionist systems where again, we're looking at one side of kind, but they integrate signals from multiple different cytokines and they see very different responses than the additive effects of the individual cytokines, right? So I think in the context of a of a living organism, you know, I think one of the things I think would be important in this area is just if we're going to, you know, tackle the problem of of, you know, cytokine or neurotransmitter signaling to and from cells, maybe we shouldn't look at as like one side of kind or one neurotransmitter at a time, right?",

Um I was at a meeting and I presented some flow data and a neuro scientist and I sat back in my seat after the talk and there was a neuro scientist next to me. I think it might have been Charles Zuker. And he said, you you he called me an immunologist. He said, you immunologist are so lucky because the cells you're interested in are floating around. You can just like, you know, just just, you know, filter them out of blood, right? You know, whereas, you know, you know, neurons are just harder to get and you can't sort them and you can't, you know, play with them in the way that that these these more motile cells are. Um, so that makes sense. But but yeah, in terms of of those similarities and differences, you know, the way the questions phrase, I'm not sure I agree with the interchangeable part. Um, you know, for all the reasons that we've already discussed. Um, but we can think of maybe it it begs the question of saying, okay, well, we know that there's a lot of differences, right? But how are they similar, right? And I think that, you know, the similarity may be where the communication is and, you know, it does come down I think to to what they're making, what types of soluble molecules are making, whatever classes those are, whatever the receptors are. And I think this important point that was also raised is is, you know, how they synapse, you know, you know, to what degree. I've seen EM pictures like the 40s, right, of a neuron and a and a really round cell before they knew it was a T cell or B cell that were synapse, right? So you know, and and that's what.

So they can't actually serve the function that the other one would serve. And so therefore if you want to have an expansible or expandable rapidly expandable cell cell population that can produce systemic levels of cytokines, the only way to do that is to have and you want that to be controlled by the nervous system, the only way to do that is to have an intermediary of an immune cell. So like in the gut, for example, we know that to go back to, you know, old pictures, there are old pictures showing that all of the nerve, you know, nerve endings in the gut are surrounded by mass cells. Like completely chalk full just like right next to them. And um, you know, we know that there are these kinds of interesting instances of uh even um they're they're not well not well studied still these days, but even in rodents actually, it's been shown that you can have conditional allergic responses. So basically that you do classical conditioning of ring a bell, give an allergen, ring a bell, give an allergen, ring a bell, give an allergen and after however many conditioning events, you can ring that bell and the the rat or mouse will actually have all its mass cells degranulate. Um, uh, these are papers from in the 80s in science that never get cited. Um, so maybe that's kind of the thing is actually that it's where where that boundary ends where the nervous system no longer is able to do that, to coordinate that function itself, then it has to speak to the immune system. And the immune system speaking to the nervous system. Yeah, I I probably one of the the it endows learning, right? That's what is the what is the nervous system good for? It's good and what is basically the most powerful evolutionary event that happened for at least for for mammals is the ability to learn.",

Of course things like intraepithelial lymphocytes do this flossing where they basically like keep moving down the escalator as the escalator of epithelial cells goes up, they actually move down to to maintain a longer lifespan. And so I think it's just not known, but it's a really good point because it to me it would make sense that this should be a longer term connection.
