You know, microbes invented all of the neurotransmitters, right? Um, that's actually how it worked. It's not that they're neurotransmitters and the microbes figured out how to make them. Uh the microbes invented dopamine, epinephrin, norepinephrin. It's because they're simple bio transformations of amino acids, simple modifications of amino acids and that thus they're evolutionarily very, very useful.",

            "transcript": "Um, and so I guess, you know, to me the the bigger challenge that the system faces to to your point Ashley that you were talking about say for using epinephrin or norepinephrin to regulate lymphoid structures is the fact that when you go to the gut, you have all these microbes basically screaming at you all the time with these and if you choose then to use those signals to build those systems, the microbes are more an interloper than anything else. Um, and so I I think I guess to start on kind of the last question, to me one of the challenges of the organizations of the structures is to have compartmentalization in a way where you don't have signals from you know, the meta organism side of things that you don't have control over genomically evolutionarily, um, messing with your own evolution of of uh of tissue structures or cellular communication within the host. But that's just my anyway, this is my biased point of view. I'll stop because I've thought a lot about, yeah, these certain aspects of this. I don't know, Sarkis, if you have thoughts or if that's consistent with your thinking.",

So I think you know, understanding that there's a lot of you know, dots that haven't been connected, but I think the basic understanding is there, right?

I mean, do we not know it because it just hasn't been looked at?

I wouldn't be I I would guess I'll I I should know. I don't remember off hand about IL33 in neurons.

Yeah, a couple papers have come out showing IL33 signaling is important in red syndrome. I think in a neuronal context is important in red syndrome. So it's there. Um, but again, you know, I'm not sure. you know, it may not be, you know, pro versus anti-inflammatory either, right? It just may be, you know, just signaling to the cell, right? I think the other concept that's really important which you know, I think to some degree we all do and and is is a fatal flaw in the way we do experiments, both immunologists and neuroscientists do is is that, you know, you take one side of kind and you throw it over an immune cell or neuron or whatever, right? But you know, it's not it's not in an organism, these cells are getting multiple signals at the same time. There's there's a few people systems biology who study these things, right? You know, who look at a particular cell type and, you know, we use reductionist systems where again, we're looking at one side of kind, but they integrate signals from multiple different cytokines and they see very different responses than the additive effects of the individual cytokines, right? So I think in the context of a of a living organism, you know, I think one of the things I think would be important in this area is just if we're going to, you know, tackle the problem of of, you know, cytokine or neurotransmitter signaling to and from cells, maybe we shouldn't look at as like one side of kind or one neurotransmitter at a time, right?",
