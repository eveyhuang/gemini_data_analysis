So I don't know how well it would hold up now, but um it was in the late 90s.",

So I think there's a lot of similarities at a at a large scale between the immune system and the nervous system. So is there evidence like I just want to explore this concept uh that no introduced of of maybe the immune system being an a tool for the nervous system right or or an extension of the nervous. Is there evidence that uh an immune cell can can receive signals from an enteric neuron and then transmit that signal to a central to a neuron or to the central nervous system where the immune system is the link between the ENS and the CNS. I know we think about the vagus nerve and and other um other ways, but I'm just wondering if if immune cells can also serve that same purpose of of linking the ENS and the CNS.",

Um and she injected I think LPS IP and immediately got histamine released in the brain within a few minutes. And so I mean to me that on the surface appears like there is this ENS CNS direct connection where the immune system would have to be involved in itself because LPS is a it's going to immediately stimulate whatever.",

And then thinking about I think this is super interesting, right?

They're just they're just primed to really send signals from the environment, the gut, the microbiome, whatever to the to the at least the enteric nervous system, right? And after that it has a super highway to the rest of the body. Um you know, I think that that's an area where there's been I think as we all know some recent advances and a really sort of promising uh set of of data to suggest that that that interaction is really biologically important between epithelial cells and and enteric neurons.",

And so by having these pseudopod kind of endocrine cells that then directly synapse with the uh directly sense luminal toxins or whatever and synapse with neurons is a way to kind of have an engineered insulated communication circuitry that doesn't get interrupted by all this other stuff that's going around going on. And I think one of the challenges in the gut both for the immune system and for chemical communication is just that there's too much shit all the time. I mean and you know, even even for antigens in a in a Pires patch at any given time, uh the number and complexity of antigens and signals that are being received actually creates a very, very different problem than you have in other places where you kind of have a silent environment and you can you know, set up your circuitry assuming that you're not going to have signals most of the time and then when you see a signal you respond. Here it's kind of like you're getting signals all the time, all the time, all the time and and you that's the problem you actually have to solve in the gut.",
