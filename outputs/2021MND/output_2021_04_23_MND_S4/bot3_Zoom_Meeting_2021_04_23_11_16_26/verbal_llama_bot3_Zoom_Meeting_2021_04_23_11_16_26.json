I think the other concept that's really important which you know, I think to some degree we all do and and is is a fatal flaw in the way we do experiments, both immunologists and neuroscientists do is is that, you know, you take one side of kind and you throw it over an immune cell or neuron or whatever, right? But you know, it's not it's not in an organism, these cells are getting multiple signals at the same time. There's there's a few people systems biology who study these things, right? You know, who look at a particular cell type and, you know, we use reductionist systems where again, we're looking at one side of kind, but they integrate signals from multiple different cytokines and they see very different responses than the additive effects of the individual cytokines, right? So I think in the context of a of a living organism, you know, I think one of the things I think would be important in this area is just if we're going to, you know, tackle the problem of of, you know, cytokine or neurotransmitter signaling to and from cells, maybe we shouldn't look at as like one side of kind or one neurotransmitter at a time, right?

I think it might have been Charles Zuker. And he said, you you he called me an immunologist. He said, you immunologist are so lucky because the cells you're interested in are floating around.

So like in the gut, for example, we know that to go back to, you know, old pictures, there are old pictures showing that all of the nerve, you know, nerve endings in the gut are surrounded by mass cells. Like completely chalk full just like right next to them.

Um, uh, these are papers from in the 80s in science that never get cited. Um, so maybe that's kind of the thing is actually that it's where where that boundary ends where the nervous system no longer is able to do that, to coordinate that function itself, then it has to speak to the immune system. And the immune system speaking to the nervous system. Yeah, I I probably one of the the it endows learning, right? That's what is the what is the nervous system good for?

I mean and you know, even even for antigens in a in a Pires patch at any given time, uh the number and complexity of antigens and signals that are being received actually creates a very, very different problem than you have in other places where you kind of have a silent environment and you can you know, set up your circuitry assuming that you're not going to have signals most of the time and then when you see a signal you respond.
