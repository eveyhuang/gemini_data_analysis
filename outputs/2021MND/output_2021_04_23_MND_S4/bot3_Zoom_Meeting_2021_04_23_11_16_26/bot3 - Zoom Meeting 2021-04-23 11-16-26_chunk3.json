But just to connect that with what we're saying here and and definitely the conversation yesterday was like what is diversity? What does that even matter? Like what's going on? But I'm wondering about is it cytokines that are released from microbiome? Is it neurotransmitters? Is it both? Like what are can we take that one more step to think about why diversity within the microbiome has some relation to how microglia are going to react. That's just one of the cell types.",

And so, you know, they seem to be kind of like the whole systems even though we we I think people like this nervous system and immune system are related, the only way they're really related is that they both have a complexity of receptor expression uh communication, etcetera.

Um I was at a meeting and I presented some flow data and a neuro scientist and I sat back in my seat after the talk and there was a neuro scientist next to me. I think it might have been Charles Zuker. And he said, you you he called me an immunologist. He said, you immunologist are so lucky because the cells you're interested in are floating around. You can just like, you know, just just, you know, filter them out of blood, right? You know, whereas, you know, you know, neurons are just harder to get and you can't sort them and you can't, you know, play with them in the way that that these these more motile cells are. Um, so that makes sense. But but yeah, in terms of of those similarities and differences, you know, the way the questions phrase, I'm not sure I agree with the interchangeable part. Um, you know, for all the reasons that we've already discussed. Um, but we can think of maybe it it begs the question of saying, okay, well, we know that there's a lot of differences, right? But how are they similar, right? And I think that, you know, the similarity may be where the communication is and, you know, it does come down I think to to what they're making, what types of soluble molecules are making, whatever classes those are, whatever the receptors are. And I think this important point that was also raised is is, you know, how they synapse, you know, you know, to what degree. I've seen EM pictures like the 40s, right, of a neuron and a and a really round cell before they knew it was a T cell or B cell that were synapse, right? So you know, and and that's what. So we know that that happens, right?",

So they can't actually serve the function that the other one would serve. And so therefore if you want to have an expansible or expandable rapidly expandable cell cell population that can produce systemic levels of cytokines, the only way to do that is to have and you want that to be controlled by the nervous system, the only way to do that is to have an intermediary of an immune cell. So like in the gut, for example, we know that to go back to, you know, old pictures, there are old pictures showing that all of the nerve, you know, nerve endings in the gut are surrounded by mass cells. Like completely chalk full just like right next to them. And um, you know, we know that there are these kinds of interesting instances of uh even um they're they're not well not well studied still these days, but even in rodents actually, it's been shown that you can have conditional allergic responses. So basically that you do classical conditioning of ring a bell, give an allergen, ring a bell, give an allergen, ring a bell, give an allergen and after however many conditioning events, you can ring that bell and the the rat or mouse will actually have all its mass cells degranulate. Um, uh, these are papers from in the 80s in science that never get cited. Um, so maybe that's kind of the thing is actually that it's where where that boundary ends where the nervous system no longer is able to do that, to coordinate that function itself, then it has to speak to the immune system. And the immune system speaking to the nervous system. Yeah, I I probably one of the the it endows learning, right? That's what is the what is the nervous system good for? It's good and what is basically the most powerful evolutionary event that happened for at least for for mammals is the ability to learn.",
