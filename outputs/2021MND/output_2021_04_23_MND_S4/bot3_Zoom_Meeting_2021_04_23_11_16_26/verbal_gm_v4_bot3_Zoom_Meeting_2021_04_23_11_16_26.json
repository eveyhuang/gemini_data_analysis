But you know, it's not it's not in an organism, these cells are getting multiple signals at the same time. There's there's a few people systems biology who study these things, right? You know, who look at a particular cell type and, you know, we use reductionist systems where again, we're looking at one side of kind, but they integrate signals from multiple different cytokines and they see very different responses than the additive effects of the individual cytokines, right? So I think in the context of a of a living organism, you know, I think one of the things I think would be important in this area is just if we're going to, you know, tackle the problem of of, you know, cytokine or neurotransmitter signaling to and from cells, maybe we shouldn't look at as like one side of kind or one neurotransmitter at a time, right?

So like in the gut, for example, we know that to go back to, you know, old pictures, there are old pictures showing that all of the nerve, you know, nerve endings in the gut are surrounded by mass cells. Like completely chalk full just like right next to them. And um, you know, we know that there are these kinds of interesting instances of uh even um they're they're not well not well studied still these days, but even in rodents actually, it's been shown that you can have conditional allergic responses. So basically that you do classical conditioning of ring a bell, give an allergen, ring a bell, give an allergen, ring a bell, give an allergen and after however many conditioning events, you can ring that bell and the the rat or mouse will actually have all its mass cells degranulate. Um, uh, these are papers from in the 80s in science that never get cited. Um, so maybe that's kind of the thing is actually that it's where where that boundary ends where the nervous system no longer is able to do that, to coordinate that function itself, then it has to speak to the immune system. And the immune system speaking to the nervous system. Yeah, I I probably one of the the it endows learning, right? That's what is the what is the nervous system good for?
