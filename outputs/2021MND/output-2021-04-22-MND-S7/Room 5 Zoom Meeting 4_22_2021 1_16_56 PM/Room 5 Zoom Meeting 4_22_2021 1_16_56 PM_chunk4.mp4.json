Um so maybe picking something that can be present in a normal healthy state, but also those same mechanisms that go array in disorders.",

And then we go back to see which of these metabolites could be produced by microbes, okay?

Other ideas are if you could introduce like probiotic organisms that um might also be associated with levels of those metabolites. The one that comes to mind for me is like a a dietary to link if any of them are sort of associated with breakdown of known nutrients or dietary nutrients.

And then you're essentially treating that microbe is is like a drug production or delivery vehicle, right? And that could go into the the challenge with that is that you have to do dosing and then the pharmacokinetics of that is really hard. Um and the variation between people is really challenging so that, you know, what works in one individual may not work in another, right? Um and then so there's the, you know, FMT transplantation uh approach uh but that's mostly just based off of the natural microbiota variation that exists. So one could I I suppose uh combine that with some type of engineering approach where you now you're engineering some natural member of the community um uh with this new functionality and so either given given that as a single strain or multiple collections of strains that then hopefully could could graft. I suppose you could do this autologously in a personalized way as we've mentioned, right? maybe either Xvo so that could you know, help you um with some of the, you know, colonization resistance, you know, uh issues. Um yeah, I think kind of probably the biggest challenge in this is is really kind of getting the therapeutic kind of dose right uh and and getting it to the places that needs to go, whether it's in the small intestine and you know, in in the large intestine, um, you know, need to get enough, you know, in the mucosal uh regions where it's to be uh bioactive for example, um, yeah.",

You can also wash away the luminal content and then extract um the the metabolites or the compounds from from the the fraction that is adhered um so that is adherent and is closer to epithelial cells.",
