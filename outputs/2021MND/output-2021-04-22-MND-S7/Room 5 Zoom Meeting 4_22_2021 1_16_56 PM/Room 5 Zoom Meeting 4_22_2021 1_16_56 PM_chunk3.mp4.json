We just don't have the equivalence of that um here I feel like and so maybe that's a potential input that would be useful um, you know, for the microbiome.",

I we don't, I just don't think we have that for the microbiome. That have the data set. Uh, and and certainly like whether you collect it in one um population is that the same as the next one? you know, it's it's it's and it's also a very kinetic, you know, it's a dynamic process.

I think sometimes it's not, if it's a if you're if the metabolite that you can measure in plasma or something that's different than if you're talking about a change in cognitive state and how do you, you know, effectively quantify that um uh, you know, and and show progress. I I think that that seems like it's it's one of the bigger challenges uh, which is why I was saying even in the animal model, you know, I guess if you run human clinical trials, you can at least ask people for that kind of feedback versus in in animals then you you're resorting to these, you know, behavioral studies which are are really kind of labor intensive and uh, you know, the cohorts that you have to deal with um, you know, especially if you're doing kind of daily dosing of your, you know, intervention um, it it's uh, it's it's it's quite challenging. So um, I wonder if there's ways that we can think about this as well.",
