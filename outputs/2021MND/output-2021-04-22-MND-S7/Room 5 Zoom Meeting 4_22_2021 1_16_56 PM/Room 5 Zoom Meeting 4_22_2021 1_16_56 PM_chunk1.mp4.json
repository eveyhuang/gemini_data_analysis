But in many cases, that's that's not the case because um I think for the very simple uh um infectious disease like a CD infection, they are very successful uh treatment like the fecal micro transplantation and many other people including many company they are working on probiotic pills try to decolonize this particular pathogen. And for sure, in the future they they might work. And so far we haven't seen any very successful probiotic pill design to decolonize CD even for this very uh simple scenario. For very complicated disease like the uh the neuro uh neurological disorders, uh the brain disorders we are talking about in this conference, I don't think there is a kind of one direction collision. It's very likely is bidirectional. So how can we make sure modulating microbiome will indeed uh benefit the host? Um so very likely you have to do the perturbation in a very consistent way and the in terms of probiotics maybe you have to do the uh administration on on a very um um um in a constant way like on a daily basis for example. Uh I'm not sure if this this is the right way to uh move forward. Um I'm sorry, I'm not very positive on this because I consider this is really a chicken egg problem. How can we make sure modulating microbiome will help?",

And so changing the microbiome composition almost no matter how we're going to do it is likely going to have those top down signals that are still detrimental and still selecting potentially for this this pathogenic environment within the gut. So we we have to come at it potentially from from both angles. I fully agree with that.",
