Are we thinking about cell signaling within different neurons, oxidative stress? Is it going to be localized? Are we thinking more generalized? Inflammation is something that I'm really interested in, neuroinflammation specifically, like astrocyte activation, microglia, like how those are activated and maybe picking targets that would have outcomes or looking at those outcomes as opposed to something more broad.",

            "transcript": "I agree. I think inflammation could be a really great target because it is of the many disorders that I think this group of people is probably thinking about. Inflammation does seem to pop up consistently. I forget where my thought was going here. But the mechanism of action by which inflammation might be mediating these different effects. We definitely know the microbiome modulates systemic immune responses and modulates neuroimmune responses. But how is that signal, that inflammatory signal, being potentiated from the gut to the brain? I think there's probably a session tomorrow on neuroinflammation specifically that we can all talk about. But there's these cell dependent effects where peripheral immune cells are getting, are being trained in the gut or getting signals directly from the gut and then crossing to the brain. But there's also the fact that the descending signals from the brain, from the spinal cord, and from the Vegas are actively also receiving these inflammatory signals. And we don't quite know how inflammation in the gut is telling those pathways to become dysfunctional or have altered function. So I think inflammation could be playing a role kind of in those two different, two different ways. But also then if inflammation is playing such a big role, then maybe the microbiome, we can bypass it. If we can, we don't need to necessarily modulate the microbiome if we can modulate inflammation, which there's a lot of really good pharmaceuticals that can do.",

            "transcript": "I think one of the other challenges, at least from my perspective, is that the microbiome is so complicated, right? There are so many factors that are, that, you know, whether it's actual individual strains or communities of strains or specific metabolites. How do we go down to the mechanistic level to be able to find those specific actors to be then go back for the engineering component, right? People have done a number of these pro-biotic studies and looked at potential effects, but very few actual mechanistic kind of, you know, down to the molecular level insights, or at least the ratio of those is very poor. So are there ways, for example, that we can drastically increase the throughput at which we can discover new neuromodulatory microbiota without going through testing individual strains and then measuring brain activity or other systemic activity? Because I think that cycle seems so slow that I feel like a lot of effort is going towards that, right? And so we're almost kind of like, if something happens, we see something, and then there's this lamppost effect where basically all of the work is focused on in those specific areas. Is there a way that we can accelerate that process?",

And do you try to put them together and build a network and then predict what is the overall flux of the community going to be and then try to change the balance of that flux? Or how do you go about doing that? And are, are the genome scale metabolic models actually trustworthy at this point? I don't know the answer to that. Maybe you guys can enlighten a bit.",

            "transcript": "Well, there are many other ways to reconstruct ecological network. You don't have to always rely on the genome scale metabolic network. So, typically, this is a system identification problem or network reconstruction problem. If you have very high quality temporal data and suppose we have absolute abundance, then there are a bunch of methods available so that they can infer the interspecies interactions. If you have, if you don't have the very high quality temporal data, if you, but you have high quality static samples, then there are any, there are also some methods available so that you can infer the interspecies interactions. So my point is that you don't have to always rely on the metabolic method. Okay, we've developed a method to analyze cross-sectional data. So suppose you have a bunch of static samples, roughly static samples, then the key idea is that the interspecies interactions somehow are encoded in the difference between different static samples, as long as they share some common species. And mathematically, you can prove that the interspecies interactions are somehow encoded in the statistic sample difference. But the point that we, this require a large number of samples. Suppose you have 1,000 species, then this require more than 5,000 samples with different species collections. This is a big number. And also we require absolute abundance. Suppose we can provide this type of data, then we can reconstruct the network for you. It's an ecological network. It's a direct and weighted signed graph.",

Maybe like another angle on it would be, for a form of like dimensional reduction, like do we have a sense for it, like even the nature of the interaction that we could target? Because even if we have a sense of that, you know, when you think about manipulating a microbial community, that also kind of constrains how you might think about your intervention.",

So I'd be curious to hear what you all sort of think about, about sort of learning from those types of studies.",

And then Rosie also did a clinical study. So yeah, we do have population diversity data. What sort of diversity you want in the samples if you want to reverse the symptoms for ASD, per se? But then, you know, how do you get them to colonize? How do you get them to adhere? How do you want to get them to be long-term stable in the gut? So, you know, is colonization something that we want to target? If you want to modulate the microbiome, do you just want things to be planktonic in the gut? And maybe some hope that they will colonize? I mean, how do we go ahead with that idea?",

And then build predictive models for that and then hopefully scale that to many different microbial communities. It's just impossible to really do at scale. Certainly, we've been thinking about ex-vivo experiments where you can kind of do that even though it doesn't faithfully recapitulate all of the in-vivo implications. But it just, at least, gives you some component because otherwise, I just feel like there's so much variation, even for animals, right? Like one animal you get from a core is not the same as the next one you potentially could get. And so, and different strains of mice will have different kind of challenges. So, yeah, I mean, I guess germ-free animals is one way to do that, but it's really hard to do, like, 100 experiments. It's really under-",
