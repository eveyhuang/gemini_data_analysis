And then clinicians continue to do really beautiful work to understand what is the earliest time point at which you start seeing alpha synuclein. And then if we found out that it's actually in the intestine at least eight years before there's any motor dysfunction. And so what we are doing is saying we have a very precise mechanism that shows how gut bacteria are specifically triggering alpha synuclein at this instance.",

It's not idiopathic, so it's a little bit different. So that's why I was curious about, you know, I often sometimes think about how do I delay, you know, preserve the progression of neurodegeneration where I already know what the insult is, not from the microbiome standpoint, but from the genetic standpoint. So, you know, maybe, maybe this, you know, this idea that you're looking at the effect of the microbiome on the aging brain, I guess, could be a way to think about it would give us information beyond just idiopathic disease. So this is what I was kind of trying to to tie in. But perhaps maybe it's maybe it's not, I don't know.",

I'm wondering actually Amina, do you want to based on maybe anything you wrote down earlier or just your thoughts on how your own work might tie in? Do you want to share anything?",

Um, I guess the way I see this is um I think that I'm interested in is inputs versus outputs. So when you have a system that function and there are things are produced within the system, we call like kind of like gross rates, right? Things are just happening within the systems and it doesn't really affect the net output. So um you you have your your microbiome and any other system and you're exposing it to food and environmental conditions and there are things happening within it but that necessarily doesn't affect the outside world.",

I I wonder what what type of bacteria do you choose to study their metabolite their database to actually even document what type of neurological disease is more related to maybe the microbiome as a as a cause to to cause those neurological disease. Yeah, good question. I mean, we're mostly looking in the literature honestly like to see what others have found to be biomarkers. Um yeah, I mean, for example, you know, so is a pretty pretty obvious one, but there are uh yeah, that's what we've been doing it so far. So pretty brute force approach. Uh just looking at what molecules have been discovered before and then testing them and seeing if we can detect those bacteria by sensing those biomarkers. And so we're we're kind of taking it one molecule at a time, one bacterium at a time and starting to build up our knowledge on based on that. All right. Yeah, in the case of the microbiome, I mean we're trying to we're trying to prioritize the those microbes that are the most prominent within the the gut microbiome for example. Uh so we're trying to study those first. Mhmm. Because yesterday I heard about this uh other than the human micro micro project there's also IH um it's a integrated or integrative human microbiome project. I wonder whether that those will provide any information between the neurological disease, the disease state and also the microbiome features. That's why I was curious because almost like integrated or curated database to, you know, for for example, if if we want to choose a disease to study on what type of evidence that we can have to even consider microbiome as as either the cause or simply a correlation. Very interesting. I'll I'll check it out. It's a good good question that you raised. Absolutely. I think integrating all this all this information that we collect individually will be be very, very helpful.",

I'm to measure actually redox potential of a complicated um uh community and it's usually highly variable. And I'm I'm wondering from your perspective as someone who like knows metals, um uh what how you think about measuring redox potential but more specifically speciation of metals within that environment because that really changes their activity if they're like going wild or if they're just kind of like in the background and fine and this can be I think one of these important mediators of disease and I know it's so hard sometimes to measure speciation.
