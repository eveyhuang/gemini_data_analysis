So it's not representative of of your sample. So I mean the trick is just to try your best to work in the same conditions as so if you're like in an anoxic environment, obviously you have to keep your your sample anoxic and um it's it's it's timing to you have to be fast.",

So this oxygen level certainly plays a role for the reducing oxidizing environment. That's like the same for example, like in the environment like for the water, if you have this aerobic environment and aerobic environment, you have very different composition of irons. For example, iron 3 plus, right? That happens in oxidizing environment. So so all those matters. I think those eventually comes to the point of um how much oxygen was there, right? I I think one of the conversation I had with one of the mentor yesterday was like, oh, can we measure oxygen down there, right?",
