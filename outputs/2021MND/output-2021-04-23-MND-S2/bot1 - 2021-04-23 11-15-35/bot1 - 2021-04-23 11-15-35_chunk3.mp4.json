I know for Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, they're trafficking, the protein trafficking system has some defects. So I I feel those markers if it's somehow related to neurological disease, which I don't really know. Currently, based on literature, it seems like autism spectrum disorder, the ASD and some depression, even for Parkinson's disease I just heard from Elizabeth. Do we know a spectrum of neurological disease that's definitely have some connection with microbiome?",

But that might for example the epithelial cell in the intestine, that might be the intermediate effector of these biomarker from the micro. But then the secondary function from the epithelial cell, it has receptor for both uh the the metabolite and also has the receptor for the neurotransmitter. So this is the one I I would think it's information hub to transfer what is requested from the uh or what is sensed from the microbiome and then propagate that signal to the to the to the neuron to the downstream neuron system through the upstream neuronal pathway.",

            "transcript": "I wonder if I can jump in with a few thoughts. Um I I guess like when I first saw this question, I think I was thinking sort of like what you were talking about just now Kai, like where you think of this kind of like bottom up approach, like where you say like, okay, you have this cell, this microbiome, it you know, whatever, it's excretes something, we can measure that, that gives us a biomarker. And I think, I mean that's what like the basic science mind thinks about. I mean that's I guess what I used to do in grad school, right? You like break something down and then try to understand it. Now, as a clinician, I think and some of the other um people, I'm sorry, I can't see your names right away, but um we're just talking about, you know, talking from the sort of top like top down. So you take the whole person and what can you detect in the whole person that gives you a biomarker. And I've been thinking about this a lot in autism because I've been doing some neuro imaging work trying to find like a neuro imaging biomarker in autism. I mean first of all, autism is not one thing. I think there's in 10 years we're going to know there's like 15 things we used to call autism and there's genetic autism, there's idiopathic autism, there's blah blah blah, right? But anyways, so you take this top down approach and to me a biomarker is not necessarily one thing, it's a collection of things that's almost like a fingerprint, you know? The biomarker is a signature that's not that's not one thing you do a lab test for, but you do several tests and the whole profile gives you the biomarker. That to me is sort of more the top down approach. I know, I find this, I find this really, really interesting because like for me, what I want to know, like like I love I love basic science, you know, I love the questions like what does this do in this little pathway and this little pathway, but that doesn't help my patients, right? So to me, my question is, is there something we can do? So so let's say you have a a child or an embryo becomes an infant and their bio their microbiome alters the way their development works such that it becomes dysfunctional. How do I like say test the mother's microbiome to know that this child or embryo is going to be at risk of neurodevelopmental conditions so that I can intervene, right? Just like whatever it is, I don't care, but I want to know what it is so I can try to help them, right? Or like how do I test the child's like, okay, they're six months old. Their microbiome puts them at risk for brain dysfunction, you know, before they can tell me, before I can, you know, then I can intervene while their brain is still developing. Like that to me is the real power of a of a biomarker, which I said, I don't think is like we're not going to get like one blood test. If we had that, we would already have it, you know what I mean? Like I think it's like a it's like a signature that you can look at. I guess so that's sort of to me the two ways I conceptualize the biomarker, like in a in a petri dish with a cell that excretes something and then with a whole human being which has a profile which you can then use to detect and intervene. I know, just some thoughts.",

            "transcript": "And to to me that's also where mechanism comes in because I think that once we have like I guess um I like to think I I start with these like studies from people and think like what is something I can hold on to that I can then build up to figure out where is that coming from? Because I think that's how like from the microbiome perspective, I think if we can find um to me what's important are not even specific bacteria but the specific genes um that are in specific organisms that we can then say, ah, okay, this this maybe this particular organism that we're setting in a test tube or the germ free mouse that's colonized, we can find a phenotype, but then that gene we can look to see how many other organisms is it in? Is this something that is more widespread and then begin to like map mechanism back up and I sorry I love this about like, yeah, how could you intervene then early? It's like this early biomarker where you see this is the beginning of a process that ends somewhere we don't want to go and how can we know what that process is so that we can kind of intervene right at the beginning of it. Um and yeah, I um yeah, I love that.",

            "transcript": "I think I'll just add that I think um one approach that has seemingly had success in recent years kind of marrying the translational with the basic in terms of biomarker discovery is the I'm sure many of you have either done or heard of it which the humanized microbiota approach so taking uh fecal transplants from human patients from clinical cohorts and transferring those into germ free animals that in some cases do then recapitulate symptoms of the human pathology and then using that as a way to sort of um investigate metabolites or markers of microbial origin that are linked to the human population and then translating that back to the data that you've obtained from say metabolomic analyses of the human cohorts. So that could be a bridge that has has worked well at least for some recent studies to connect clinical uh data to more basic studies and drilling down to more mechanistic studies as well. Yeah.",
