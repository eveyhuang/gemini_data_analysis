And then uh the the idea of of um how that's what what the signal actually is, what's the cyto kind or the microbe bind to to to the a neuron, um they have a representation or electrophysiological representation or activity. Um something called uh like a neurogram if you will, like for a particular cyto kind or particular microbe, which is one of my ideas actually for uh project is, are there different um activation signatures um um in the Vegas for particular microbes that can give you an idea what's happening and how the brain is affected downstream and this is in the context of whatever disease state you want to think about, PD, AD. Um etc etc. Um because we know that for for a fact that that happens in the context of of particular cyto kinds, TNF alpha, I1 beta, they have a particular um uh firing pattern if you will.",
