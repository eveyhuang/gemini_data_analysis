We call it like topic immune expression. And then there's some there's this is already out um that in a high fat diet or during obesity the the neurons look like fat cells. Um where they're um have more leptin and they respond to more more more like um um metabolic uh signatures in the gut. So yeah, and the cool thing about these sensory neurons in the periphery is that they they can they can do this because they're, you know, they're outside of the blood brain barrier and they're able to be influenced by the by stimulus outside stimuli outside of the the brain.
