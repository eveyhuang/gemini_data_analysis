Uh the toxins that it is producing, it it it is stressing another pathogen, another you know, a common cell bacteria for example, another bacteria or another uh fungi or something. Uh first of all, you know, microbiome uh we we we can you know make it broader, it's not just bacteria, right? There are others that are also involved. Uh so I think um actually this was one of the topics of our previous group, the the one that I was in. Uh talking about uh you know, there is inter species interaction, virus, uh fungus, bacteria and you know, others um and how they are affecting each other. So I think some of those they can be uh nutri nutrition for one species but like a stress or the byproduct of that metabolism, it could be a stress factor for another uh species.

Uh and for that discussion, you may consider the uh host derived stress and the other one would be the microbial stress. Obviously lack of oxygen is a stress proof for aerobic bacteria whereas the presence of oxygen is a stressful for anaerobic and the pH and uh and in a gut for example, the movement of the gut I was intrigued that as a gastroenterology that the neuros neuros scientist talking about the bowel movement. Um in in in a host. the the kind of things that obviously I have to do it on a daily basis for the uh motility of the gut can be stressed um in um uh in the micro. I do and many people complain saying that I'm just creating a stress to the host or the micro by changing the circadian. Yes, that is the biological uh uh stress. For the stress to me is change in homeostatic environment of the organism. Um and I like the idea one of you said that the uh stress in one species can result in the stress in the others although environment may not be stressful for one species and could be with other and interactions.

Unless actually but what you're saying like in in terms of uh increased flow, um and uh in in in diarrhea, coli goes up a lot because it's better it has more stress response genes. So it's Yeah. And so um like so I focus on the whole microbiome and we find that when we do like sub gingival communities and we do an abundance analysis, you know, out of the top 10 bacteria, you know, species level we are going into and they are different genus also. Only one is model and that's called as capnocytophaga. Okay? Now, that doesn't mean that that one model bacteria is not important because that one is found in all human samples that we get and is like the second or the third most abundant bacteria. Okay? And we find that this model bacteria helps shape the structure of a microbial community essentially, okay? So you don't need all of them to be model. If you have one bacterium in that community or few bacterium in that community that are driving fluid flows or are you know carrying other bacteria around which we find is the case for us.",
