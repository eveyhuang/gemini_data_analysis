And we have done those monitoring um in vitro as as well as in um um cell culture, mammalian cell cultures um integrated with the cells and then exciting the cells with the drugs and see how those uh small molecules change over time. So we look at real time monitoring basically. And we also are working on variable um diagnostics, variable sensors that they can monitor the physiology of the let's say human. Uh like temperature, heart rate, uh and environment like temperature of the environment and things like that. So we are interested to really see how environment and the um the human in terms of the neurotransmitters and the microbiome uh they are correlated uh using our sensors that we can contribute. Nice to meet you all.",

And we find that these physical factors are really important uh in understanding uh diseases such as uh inflammatory bowel disease in which uh not only is there a strong inflammatory response, but there's also very important local changes such as uh oxidative stress, uh uh local changes in temperature if there's inflammation, uh changes in pH uh and malabsorption.",
