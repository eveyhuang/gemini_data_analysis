Uh talking about uh you know, there is inter species interaction, virus, uh fungus, bacteria and you know, others um and how they are affecting each other.

Um in in in a host. the the kind of things that obviously I have to do it on a daily basis for the uh motility of the gut can be stressed um in um uh in the micro. I do and many people complain saying that I'm just creating a stress to the host or the micro by changing the circadian. Yes, that is the biological uh uh stress. For the stress to me is change in homeostatic environment of the organism. Um and I like the idea one of you said that the uh stress in one species can result in the stress in the others although environment may not be stressful for one species and could be with other and interactions.

Only one is model and that's called as capnocytophaga. Okay? Now, that doesn't mean that that one model bacteria is not important because that one is found in all human samples that we get and is like the second or the third most abundant bacteria. Okay? And we find that this model bacteria helps shape the structure of a microbial community essentially, okay? So you don't need all of them to be model. If you have one bacterium in that community or few bacterium in that community that are driving fluid flows or are you know carrying other bacteria around which we find is the case for us.",

Um might be one way to start to get a handle on this because I guess from what I'm what I'm gathering from the conversation is there are just so many different types of stress, so many different types of stress response that we're thinking about that we need to kind of start to define, okay, which ones do we want to look at, how do we look at them? Um which is all its own kind of question, like how do you define which which stress is the most important on a microbe.

Oxidative stress is one of them, I guess this one of common stressors to many things.

Um, and I think the points that have been made now by Chris and Carolina and others about like the need for genetic tools are very good. Um, in the absence of those, we might have to think about more global interventions, um, with small molecules or things. Again, it depends on the type of stress and it's taking kind of a sledgehammer approach because it's not a very precise mechanism, but if you're thinking about pH stress or oxidative stress, are there small molecule modulators, um, you know, I previously worked with vibrio cholera a lot and for a lot of those animal models, the way you get them to work is to dose the rabbit with an antacid to enable a relaxation of the bottleneck of the stomach so you get reliable colonization of the intestine. So are there things like that that can address major bottlenecks in the host that affect microbial growth and colonization. It's just an idea.",

And then we talked about host stress like in PTSD, Alzheimer disease or others. Then we talked about engineering in um genetics, for example, non model species may be or organite type models, mass models and combining the physiologically relevant and the reductionist approach. It's important, I think Lisa mentioned it's important to make sure we are mimicking the environment properly. Um, so then we can study uh different factors in a reliable way. And uh the second question was the signals can be disrupted or intercepted as needed. How can can they be? So somewhere in bioengineering, probiotics, um, I don't remember who mentioned that.

Second is a lot of the traditional method rely on homologous combination and the selection is antibiotic resistance. So we just don't know what sort of antibiotic resistant profiles certain bacteria have once we have to grow them in the lab to do all of that and then we have to figure out which plasma can go in and which plasma for integrate and things like that. So those are the challenges. I this just needs more effort, more volume of effort. Like the initial E methods were developed using phages actually by and other people.
