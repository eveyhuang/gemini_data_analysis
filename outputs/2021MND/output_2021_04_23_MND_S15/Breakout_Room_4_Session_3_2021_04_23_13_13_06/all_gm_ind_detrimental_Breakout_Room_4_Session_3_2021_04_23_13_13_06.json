But in I thought it's stress is really depends on the model we're studying, you know, if we're studying and the neurodegenerative disease and what the stress will be and uh in for the GI uh the GI disease and what the what stress we should actually study or focus.

Um there must be a kind of sensor proteins or in the bacteria and that can sense the stress and then has a like intracellular signaling pathway, often times is a activation of transcription factors. So I feel these actually can be studied um in individual that in a really simple model model case. Of course um in I guess in the gut there's still much more complications.

The microbiologist in since the last, you know, 50, 60 years or even more 70 years have mostly focused on developing genetic tools for proteobacteria like equal and others. And bacteriodities uh people didn't really think a lot about. There were like few labs Abigail Saliers and few others who were making mutations in bacteriodities. And then in the last decade or so only now we have some tools to genetically manipulate. Although we can also over express certain proteins and we don't have like nice inducible promoters and things like that which work very well still.",

And then we talked about host stress like in PTSD, Alzheimer disease or others. Then we talked about engineering in um genetics, for example, non model species may be or organite type models, mass models and combining the physiologically relevant and the reductionist approach. It's important, I think Lisa mentioned it's important to make sure we are mimicking the environment properly. Um, so then we can study uh different factors in a reliable way. And uh the second question was the signals can be disrupted or intercepted as needed. How can can they be? So somewhere in bioengineering, probiotics, um, I don't remember who mentioned that. Uh, I assume it's like related to synthetic biology maybe. Um, Okay, what do you think? Suggestions? What did I miss? Let me just add these.",

If you want to target Clostridial species A, you would need some way to get the DNA just to that taxa and not to Clostridial species B. Um so you need some kind of phage. I know some groups are working on that. Um I can't remember where I saw a recent publication on it, but um loading CRISPR type systems into phage and using that to modify the gut microbiota, but that would also require some phage biology that I'm not sure how well that's that's understood in the gut.",

So it's same way we have different species of bacteria or different genus. So what works in E doesn't work in. Second is a lot of the traditional method rely on homologous combination and the selection is antibiotic resistance. So we just don't know what sort of antibiotic resistant profiles certain bacteria have once we have to grow them in the lab to do all of that and then we have to figure out which plasma can go in and which plasma for integrate and things like that. So those are the challenges. I this just needs more effort, more volume of effort. Like the initial E methods were developed using phages actually by and other people. Um and so, you know, people just need to be more motivated to do it.",
