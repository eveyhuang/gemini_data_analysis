Um in in in a host. the the kind of things that obviously I have to do it on a daily basis for the uh motility of the gut can be stressed um in um uh in the micro. I do and many people complain saying that I'm just creating a stress to the host or the micro by changing the circadian. Yes, that is the biological uh uh stress. For the stress to me is change in homeostatic environment of the organism.

Only one is model and that's called as capnocytophaga. Okay? Now, that doesn't mean that that one model bacteria is not important because that one is found in all human samples that we get and is like the second or the third most abundant bacteria. Okay? And we find that this model bacteria helps shape the structure of a microbial community essentially, okay? So you don't need all of them to be model. If you have one bacterium in that community or few bacterium in that community that are driving fluid flows or are you know carrying other bacteria around which we find is the case for us.",

So trying to think about what what ways we can use to study, I guess in a more high throughput way what the impact of different conditions on these different taxa are. Um might be one way to start to get a handle on this because I guess from what I'm what I'm gathering from the conversation is there are just so many different types of stress, so many different types of stress response that we're thinking about that we need to kind of start to define, okay, which ones do we want to look at, how do we look at them? Um which is all its own kind of question, like how do you define which which stress is the most important on a microbe. Oxidative stress seems like a reasonable place to start just based on leaky gut and what we know about oxidative stress and um metabolism, but I guess I'm trying to run through that.",

Oxidative stress is one of them, I guess this one of common stressors to many things. Uh either this is the uh there's uh short chain amino acid break down and also fragmented polypeptide and mitochondria and all the bacteria changes bio fluid changes they all create the oxidative stress. But in I thought it's stress is really depends on the model we're studying, you know, if we're studying and the neurodegenerative disease and what the stress will be and uh in for the GI uh the GI disease and what the what stress we should actually study or focus.

I think this one although since um can be actually understood in like reductive models because you would just want to look at how each micro um bion like each bacteria respond to different kind of stress. Um there must be a kind of sensor proteins or in the bacteria and that can sense the stress and then has a like intracellular signaling pathway, often times is a activation of transcription factors. So I feel these actually can be studied um in individual that in a really simple model model case. Of course um in I guess in the gut there's still much more complications. However, I think even in a lab space already we can draw so much more understanding about um how they respond to each stress.",

Um, and I think the points that have been made now by Chris and Carolina and others about like the need for genetic tools are very good. Um, in the absence of those, we might have to think about more global interventions, um, with small molecules or things. Again, it depends on the type of stress and it's taking kind of a sledgehammer approach because it's not a very precise mechanism, but if you're thinking about pH stress or oxidative stress, are there small molecule modulators, um, you know, I previously worked with vibrio cholera a lot and for a lot of those animal models, the way you get them to work is to dose the rabbit with an antacid to enable a relaxation of the bottleneck of the stomach so you get reliable colonization of the intestine.

And then we talked about host stress like in PTSD, Alzheimer disease or others. Then we talked about engineering in um genetics, for example, non model species may be or organite type models, mass models and combining the physiologically relevant and the reductionist approach. It's important, I think Lisa mentioned it's important to make sure we are mimicking the environment properly. Um, so then we can study uh different factors in a reliable way. And uh the second question was the signals can be disrupted or intercepted as needed. How can can they be? So somewhere in bioengineering, probiotics, um, I don't remember who mentioned that.

So we just don't know what sort of antibiotic resistant profiles certain bacteria have once we have to grow them in the lab to do all of that and then we have to figure out which plasma can go in and which plasma for integrate and things like that.
