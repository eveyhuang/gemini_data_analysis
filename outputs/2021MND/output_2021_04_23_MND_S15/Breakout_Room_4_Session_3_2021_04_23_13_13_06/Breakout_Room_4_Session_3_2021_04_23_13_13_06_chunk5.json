So we saw a lot of metabolism, amino acid disruption and the the metabolic regulation and uh ferroptosis and the uh in the autophagy related cell death and the endocytosis related uh the signaling pathway.

I try to imagine the microbiome in a way that you know, what if the most prominent species were or more prominent uh you know, fila was not bacteriodities. What if it was proteobacteria, you know, equal like bacteria that could easily easily be genetically modified. The microbiologist in since the last, you know, 50, 60 years or even more 70 years have mostly focused on developing genetic tools for proteobacteria like equal and others. And bacteriodities uh people didn't really think a lot about. There were like few labs Abigail Saliers and few others who were making mutations in bacteriodities. And then in the last decade or so only now we have some tools to genetically manipulate. Although we can also over express certain proteins and we don't have like nice inducible promoters and things like that which work very well still.",
