So we could collect the the the stool sample but we collect blood sample in in conjunction. And uh from from the serum uh sorry, from from the stool you can generate metagenome data. people can also look at uh fecal um uh uh micro RNA which some of the microbiome uh are associated with and from the blood you can do immune profiling, uh transcriptomics and so forth. And and obviously metabolomics. Um we also have uh the the there's some work looking at um cell circulating uh DNA looking for methylation profile which is trying to basically use as little sample that we need from humans to infer a lot more information. So from the circulating DNA, we can infer um tissue of origin and um specifically looking using single cell reference maps of methylation and uh uh so you can infer if there compared to the control level background, is there elevated level of say brain cells or or OPC cells or or etc. That's in your circulating blood that's beyond the normal turnover. This this sort of work has been done primarily in cancer uh liquid biopsy but uh we're trying to develop into um as biomarkers for neuro neurodegeneration.",

It was by uh first author Huge Kovich Savision where it was in published in nature and they found that a lot of these association studies done with microbiome data are confounded by host attributes such as smoking, obesity, etc. I see a lot of you nodding, so you guys have probably seen it. So, um recently with a collaborator we were trying to discuss what data do we need to collect apart from the stool data and we took a look at that paper because we didn't want to be uh running into trouble with these confounders ourselves, though obviously noise correction methods and so on are needed. So, that may be a useful resource.",

Um so one about the uh utilizing specimens and like the expense of of collecting from humans. I feel like well the vast majority of the expense is actually doing the collection. You know, employing research coordinators and um recruitment efforts and things like that. Then uh but I feel like uh and this was sort of mentioned earlier just even about the data, Stephanie mentioned this, the data and a data set, you might focus on one metabolic pathway and ignore the other 10,000 molecules that you might have collected information on. But it's even compounded by the fact that if you take a stool sample and what you're interested in or what you're interested in measuring are the metagenomes, there's so much other stuff in that stool that could be used, maybe you don't know how to use it, maybe it's not part of your current study, but if you talk to someone who studies immune markers in stool, they could give you some idea of how could you preserve the stuff that you would be normally chucking in the garbage and put it in the freezer that they if they could, you know, um find the funding to do it.",

I I I I would just echo that in that in that uh uh when we we when we collect samples, we follow the um the HMP2 protocol of collection in which they have uh basically one again we're talking about stool sample collection. We have one tube that's coming from ethanol containing vial, the other come from a non ethanol containing sort of a dry vial and then we make aliquots for each. Um and and we for for for sequencing we only need something like 100 nanograms uh from the ethanol containing tube. So, uh but we preserve uh some of them are you know mark for proteomics but even though we're not really doing that right now, um some of them are you know mark for um metabolomics uh from fecal metabol not just the serum metabol which I'm more interested in. Um and and and also for future experiments where you can that's from the dry tube you can sort of free, you know, culture potentially populated um to to to to do the experiments but even though we haven't we really just use like you know, I guess uh 1/10th of the sample that we have collected so far.
