And not just being healthy, but also in disease populations in which we have even more confounders. Um, things like treatment, uh immune modulating treatment in particular for for for disease that's involved the immune system such as multiple sclerosis profoundly affects the the gut microbiome. Uh there there are multiple studies that show that so even though when we study disease, uh microbiome in in autoimmune diseases in in neuroinflammatory diseases, um almost all the patients are on some sort of treatment. And and accounting for just what they are being treated may not be adequate because people were treated with different medications at different time point that may have longer term impact. Um, I think these are all major challenges. Um, but but going back to another question that was saying earlier, because these treatments are important, um, so so it's so important perturbations, they they um, they will we expect them to have a greater impact. you can think of them as sort of the natural experiment that has already taken place. But the challenge for us doing human research is having the having the the time horizon to capture these information and as the metadata uh that we can add to this um omic data collection in order to do some causal inference.",

The um so I feel like my the way I initially interpreted your question is if you have microbiome data for irritable bowel syndrome and then you have microbiome data for another um disease state and then microbiome data for another disease, can you start to like piece together a broader picture just amongst microbiome experiments. And I was just going to comment that it becomes much more challenging um for metabolomics than for some of uh genomics or transcriptomics because um the ability to quantify metabolite A versus metabolite B is entirely platform dependent and much more so, much more sensitive than it is for transcript A versus transcript B if you're measuring transcriptomics.",

So, um actually this type of a problem has been studied by computer scientists for a while. They consider this kind of a multi view data. So, um they have developed some interesting methods, for example, the so called similarity network diffusion method. And the basic idea is very simple. If you look at each single omics data type, um you can construct a so called patient similarity network. It's based on correlation, I agree, but let let's let's assume we just use correlation. So you construct a patient similarity network based on any single omics data type. And then you do the fusion and this is the magic moment. You fuse all the single network into a big integrated patient similarity network. And from there, then you can study different types of problem, for example, uh the disease subtyping or patient stratification or do some prediction. So, I think this problem the integration has been studied by computer scientists from very different angle.",
