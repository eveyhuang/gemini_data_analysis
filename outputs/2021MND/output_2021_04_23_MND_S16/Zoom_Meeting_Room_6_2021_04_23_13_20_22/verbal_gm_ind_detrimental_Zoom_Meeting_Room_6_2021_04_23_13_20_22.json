And right now the method is claimed to be able to infer causal relationship. And the idea is that uh for example, if you LDL cholesterol is positively correlated with heart disease and a lot of studies find that, but it could be confounded by many factors. Imagine that there's a genetic variant that can increase LDL and it's it's a causal variant, we know that. Some individual will carry that variant. Some individual will carry the reference allele. It's like a randomized trial, assign the treatment placebo randomly to different individuals. You follow them for a lifetime, and then you see for those that carry the variant, they have they have higher LDL by definition. Do they tend to have higher risk of heart disease? And putting that kind of information together can help us infer if LDL is causal for heart disease. And this has been published. And also HDL, the good cholesterol, using the same method has been shown that it is not causally uh leading to heart disease. Genetic variant increase HDL do not associate with lower risk of heart disease. So that is is is a method called Mendelian randomization. And very recently in 2019, there's a nature genetic paper that study the causal relationship of uh microbiome uh short chain and then a metabolic trait, type two diabetes. They study the effect of uh butyrate on obesity and type two diabetes using that approach. And if you guys accept that approach, then we can leverage a lot of the existing data set. You only need a G for a metabolite. And then you need G for the outcome, for the disease. Putting those information together in a statistical network can help you infer if that metabolite is causal for the outcome. Uh and we have a lot of data out there for metabolite. We have less data for microbiome because G for microbiome mostly is small data set, so it's not that reliable. But if we look at butyrate, acetate, we we have large G for them. For example, in UK Biobank, they have 200,000 participants with those uh biomarker. So I think there's a lot of opportunity using that method if you believe that it is causal. But I I I personally feel that at least it's one step forward towards causal, better than correlation. That's that's my idea. ",

I feel like you can really benefit if you have someone in the team who knows a little bit about both, who speaks both languages or you know, those two people, the the genomicist knows enough about metabolomics not to make poor assumptions in trying to draw those correlations and vice versa.

I think this was a very interesting session. It's interesting to hear what your perspective is. All the sessions I've been part of um it's it's always interesting to hear what the group what direction they go with it. Um we hardly ever talked about uh gut brain axis or anything to do that. This was sort of a high level discussion about big data sets and and and how you deal with things. Um certainly one of the things that the I'll just put this out there just so that uh uh it it's in people's minds. It's not necessarily something that uh is right or or better than than what we're doing but uh certainly one of the things that multi omix data sets sort of the hot area that is now are making these tissue atlases for example. So if you look at the enteric nervous system um and you make a multi omic data set there, you can divide it or or the goal is to divide it into what are actually the different tissue types that are there based on some kind of multi omic profile of of individual cells or groups of cells and then how does that what what what anatomical location is that within the GI tract, what what microbes are likely to be in that area. It's very different uh uh at the at the top of the small intestine than it is down at the bottom of the colon. Uh you know, those kind of those kinds of questions about how the gut can communicate with the brain through the enteric nervous system and how you use multi. There's a whole dimension that I don't think we touched on there and um when you're thinking about your your two and three person projects, just remember the goal here is to be bold and you know, try to do something uh highly impactful uh but but manageable, not not completely over the top. And and um I think our discussion was very good but it was kind of high level and and you might think of some of these other kind of methods driven uh approaches to how multi omics is going to uh allow us to understand the connection between the microbiome, whether it's in the gut or any other tissue and the brain. Um oral microbiome is pretty interesting as well because your mouth is much closer to your brain than your gut is and so uh the possibility for communication there is quite different. So anyway, I just throw out a few thoughts for everybody as you as you make your as you pair off or or or break in the threes uh however you're doing it to think of your projects. ",
