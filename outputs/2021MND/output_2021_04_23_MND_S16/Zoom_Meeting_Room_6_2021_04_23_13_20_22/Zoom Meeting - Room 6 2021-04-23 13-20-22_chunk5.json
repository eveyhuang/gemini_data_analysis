            "transcript": "Single cause at the beginning, everything else is correlated. And I I want to propose one idea uh from human genetics. And right now the method is claimed to be able to infer causal relationship. And the idea is that uh for example, if you LDL cholesterol is positively correlated with heart disease and a lot of studies find that, but it could be confounded by many factors. Imagine that there's a genetic variant that can increase LDL and it's it's a causal variant, we know that. Some individual will carry that variant. Some individual will carry the reference allele. It's like a randomized trial, assign the treatment placebo randomly to different individuals. You follow them for a lifetime, and then you see for those that carry the variant, they have they have higher LDL by definition. Do they tend to have higher risk of heart disease? And putting that kind of information together can help us infer if LDL is causal for heart disease. And this has been published. And also HDL, the good cholesterol, using the same method has been shown that it is not causally uh leading to heart disease. Genetic variant increase HDL do not associate with lower risk of heart disease. So that is is is a method called Mendelian randomization. And very recently in 2019, there's a nature genetic paper that study the causal relationship of uh microbiome uh short chain and then a metabolic trait, type two diabetes. They study the effect of uh butyrate on obesity and type two diabetes using that approach. And if you guys accept that approach, then we can leverage a lot of the existing data set. You only need a G for a metabolite. And then you need G for the outcome, for the disease. Putting those information together in a statistical network can help you infer if that metabolite is causal for the outcome. Uh and we have a lot of data out there for metabolite. We have less data for microbiome because G for microbiome mostly is small data set, so it's not that reliable. But if we look at butyrate, acetate, we we have large G for them. For example, in UK Biobank, they have 200,000 participants with those uh biomarker. So I think there's a lot of opportunity using that method if you believe that it is causal. But I I I personally feel that at least it's one step forward towards causal, better than correlation. That's that's my idea.",

And then um maybe this could be like a heading of different approaches, which is so model generation, predictive models that that can be useful across multiple omix data sets. Um we discussed the issue of um fully and efficiently using data sets. Um so for example, the stool idea that I can't remember who brought up but that that we might be wasting really valuable data within a particular specimen or whatever.
