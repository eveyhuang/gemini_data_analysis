What I really took away is that we need rigorous designs and we need multidisciplinary teams. Stephanie made the point, you know, like how do you understand my data if I just deposit it, right? And I don't think we're at the point at least in this field where the standards are there. So you're and even once we are at that point where the standards are there, you're still going to need informed multidisciplinary teams applying the different approaches. I don't know what others think about that.",

Um and sounds like they might be really well annotated based on, you know, many years of practice and of doing that, but I'd be totally garbage at like applying analyses and knowing what I might be doing wrong um or you know, how just poor assumptions being made if I were try to analyze that data set. And what I think another part that becomes incredibly important when you want to start making these associations, you don't just need someone who is really well versed at metabolomics and someone who's really well versed at genomics. I feel like you can really benefit if you have someone in the team who knows a little bit about both, who speaks both languages or you know, those two people, the the genomicist knows enough about metabolomics not to make poor assumptions in trying to draw those correlations and vice versa.",

But I always think about just the ethics of all of this collecting that we do and I know in the research projects that I've been around we're always slapping on another sample. Like I do oral collection. So oh you're doing this study, could I collect some saliva or could I do this? It's easy, it's whatever. But I always like and sometimes we're collecting so many samples from these participants and I always think I don't know, is that okay? Is it like what are the ethical things that we should be thinking about? So even having an ethical an ethicist on the team.",

And um we I have to say that we were very guilty of collect every the collect everything model, right? Because going back was always much harder. Um but then what happened is that there's just freezers full of things and ultimately it gets lost.

I think there's also this component of um doing human research, we have to be opportunistic because um what I mean by opportunistic is we have to be resourceful in using what we have because we're not going to get everything we need. We're not going to have all the time points that we have. And um the Mendelian genetics approach is is is interesting a way of, you know, bring different data sets but in some ways it's speaking to this kind of um uh you know, point.

It's interesting to hear what your perspective is. All the sessions I've been part of um it's it's always interesting to hear what the group what direction they go with it. Um we hardly ever talked about uh gut brain axis or anything to do that. This was sort of a high level discussion about big data sets and and and how you deal with things. Um certainly one of the things that the I'll just put this out there just so that uh uh it it's in people's minds. It's not necessarily something that uh is right or or better than than what we're doing but uh certainly one of the things that multi omix data sets sort of the hot area that is now are making these tissue atlases for example. So if you look at the enteric nervous system um and you make a multi omic data set there, you can divide it or or the goal is to divide it into what are actually the different tissue types that are there based on some kind of multi omic profile of of individual cells or groups of cells and then how does that what what what anatomical location is that within the GI tract, what what microbes are likely to be in that area. It's very different uh uh at the at the top of the small intestine than it is down at the bottom of the colon. Uh you know, those kind of those kinds of questions about how the gut can communicate with the brain through the enteric nervous system and how you use multi. There's a whole dimension that I don't think we touched on there and um when you're thinking about your your two and three person projects, just remember the goal here is to be bold and you know, try to do something uh highly impactful uh but but manageable, not not completely over the top. And and um I think our discussion was very good but it was kind of high level and and you might think of some of these other kind of methods driven uh approaches to how multi omics is going to uh allow us to understand the connection between the microbiome, whether it's in the gut or any other tissue and the brain. Um oral microbiome is pretty interesting as well because your mouth is much closer to your brain than your gut is and so uh the possibility for communication there is quite different. So anyway, I just throw out a few thoughts for everybody as you as you make your as you pair off or or or break in the threes uh however you're doing it to think of your projects.",
