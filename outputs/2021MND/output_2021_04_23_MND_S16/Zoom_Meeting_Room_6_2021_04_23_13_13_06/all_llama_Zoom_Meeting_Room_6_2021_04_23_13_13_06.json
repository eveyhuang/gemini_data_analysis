So our topic as everybody knows is um is multiomics and so we have a few questions to just get us started and we'll take a minute to think about these questions and write down a few thoughts. Um but the questions are, um are there multiomic approaches that can be used beyond correlation to better leverage the massive data collection efforts of genomics, epigenomics, metagenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, etc. Um so what are the what are the approaches beyond correlation? Uh what data must be part of a repository, molecular, cellular, imaging, genomic, metagenomic, clinical measures, etc. And how can it be integrated effectively to track gut brain interactions? So what are the integration methods? And um finally, what tools are available to mine these high dimensional data sets including longitudinal data to follow both bacterial populations and neural populations simultaneously and what needs to be uh developed? So the last one is about um tools that are available or maybe we can imagine tools and and think big. What are what what could we design? Um so please take a minute just to either write down your thoughts about these questions.",
