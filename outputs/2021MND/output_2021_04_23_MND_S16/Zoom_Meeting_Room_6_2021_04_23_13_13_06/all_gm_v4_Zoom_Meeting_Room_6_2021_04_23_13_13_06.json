Um but the questions are, um are there multiomic approaches that can be used beyond correlation to better leverage the massive data collection efforts of genomics, epigenomics, metagenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, etc. Um so what are the what are the approaches beyond correlation? Uh what data must be part of a repository, molecular, cellular, imaging, genomic, metagenomic, clinical measures, etc. And how can it be integrated effectively to track gut brain interactions? So what are the integration methods? And um finally, what tools are available to mine these high dimensional data sets including longitudinal data to follow both bacterial populations and neural populations simultaneously and what needs to be uh developed? So the last one is about um tools that are available or maybe we can imagine tools and and think big. What are what what could we design?
