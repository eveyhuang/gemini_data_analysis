Uh what data must be part of a repository, molecular, cellular, imaging, genomic, metagenomic, clinical measures, etc. And how can it be integrated effectively to track gut brain interactions? So what are the integration methods? And um finally, what tools are available to mine these high dimensional data sets including longitudinal data to follow both bacterial populations and neural populations simultaneously and what needs to be uh developed?
