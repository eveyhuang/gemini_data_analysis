Well, I I know I I uh use a a figure from a I believe a John Cryan review that talks about all the different, you know, conduits or or mechanisms of communication between the gut and the brain which include immune, neuronal, small molecule, hormonal, um uh bacterial derived versus host derived and and uh you know, so we know that there's certainly a number of different mechanisms of communication. I think all have been to some degree, you know, studied, right? Uh I don't know if there are other thoughts or um or what is, you know, are there specific types of communication that may in particular context be more important than others and and to what degree do we understand, you know, which mechanism is at play in a particular context. I don't know if you have thoughts on on, you know, you know, just the level of understanding we have so far.",

This is not exactly my field, but one of the general perceptions that I have is that although there are quite a bit of surveys, um, and exploratory studies on on the metabolism and the different metabolites, um, that can interact with with the host, there's still not a ton known as to what which specific microbes or micro groups produce them and and and that would be to me would be really important to then know how the microbiome can be modulated in order to change uh the metabolic output for metabolites of host health importance.",

So when we talk about messages, are we talking about the physical um molecule that is propagating through different um systems or are we also referred to the response um or the response between these different system because I feel um I mean again when whenever we get into this kind of discussion, I feel it's it's probably um relevant to to define the message first.",

So like mass spec is great for getting, you know, a big picture look at all the different molecules there in the tissue, whereas like I'm a sensors person. So I'm like really good at measuring one or two things but really fast temporal resolution in live tissue. So it depends on the the question you're trying to I guess ask. So I mean, and I think both are important. Um, so I guess when you're defining the messengers, it's like, do you want to look at a snapshot in time of like all the different messengers that are um present or is it important to look at dynamics of how they're signaling? Because that that can dictate what technology you choose.",

So in addition, and I'm not even sure off the top of my head other than the way an experiment is done, I'm not sure how this would happen, but you know, define the chemical but somehow spinning them in in a way where there's at least some initial insight as to what molecules may be bioactive, right? Because you know, microbiome is producing has a metabolic capacity of the liver, right? produces just so many molecules, not all of them are going to be relevant in a particular context. So again maybe it's the way you set up your experiment that you already have a an output of interest in one group of humans or one group of mice and not in another and so you can do sort of combinatorial or use combinatorial approaches, but there were improved ways of saying, you know, in in addition to measuring molecules, like I believe these molecules are the ones that are most bioactive. And at least it constrains that that chemical space, right? And and allows you to, you know, potentially get at the the ones that are that are mediating an effect. and I I just don't know how off top of my head I just don't know what those systems would look like.",
