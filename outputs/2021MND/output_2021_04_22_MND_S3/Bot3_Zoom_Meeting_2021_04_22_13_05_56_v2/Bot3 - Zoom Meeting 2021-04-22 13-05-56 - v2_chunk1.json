One question that I had with the neuronal models is whether it's really important to um capture spatial differences from like cell body to through axon and actual synapse because a lot of times I see that the in vitro systems just use the neuron and just dump, you know, metabolite onto it and assumes that the receptors um, you know, are the same at the cell the soma versus, you know, um the synapse. And so, yeah, do you think that um really matters to actually have to grow out the neurons and confine the interactions to actually the synapse only or the axon.",

Um you know, there are some devices that make that possible, but the issue in those cases is the scalability is the challenge. So you might have to start off with something that's like crude as you describe where you're just like dumping the metabolites on just in the beginning and then once you have at least some potential interesting interactions then use those more complex models to figure out signals to end up with.",
