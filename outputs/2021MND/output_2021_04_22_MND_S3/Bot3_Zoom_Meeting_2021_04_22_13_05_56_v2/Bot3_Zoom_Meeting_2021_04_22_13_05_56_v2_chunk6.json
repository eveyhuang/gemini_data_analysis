Um but then what Judith was alluded alluding to or information flow. I see these really big physiological questions, like information flow through the vagus nerve versus immune and all of these things that are happening at once. And when I think about the complexity and if the goal is finally to understand brain and behavior, um which is big physiological response. I I feel like over overwhelmed and I wonder whether model system in vitro systems will will do it or whether actually going to in silico systems, like kind of like neural network modeling where you don't need to know all the details, but you just need to have this giant model um would um be better suited. And so um I think probably all of the approaches have um their pros and cons, but that kind of comes to mind when I think about gut brain axis.",

Uh I I I still remember the the nature paper published last year from Harvard uh Kevin's lab. They actually definitely showed this ALS mice showed a difference of of of gut micro microbiome and if they if if if the animals raising hover or raising this is the other institution, they definitely showed different vulnerability to this disease as well. So I think the the for the whole field, there's a key question is what is the basis of the microbiome actually does the work and is responsible for the signal transduction in the gut brain axis communication. And what model will be most suitable to do this sort of research.",

Because but this is for this session we are talking about if there is cell culture model available, if we can establish some cell culture model, make it our research more simplified. So the thing is this is my valuable question. Um you know, we we we all work on the lab or benchmark, we use the culture models and if like we are so simplified for based on the discussion, we actually um come out the cell culture model. I just really um my question is how how great the society accept the cell culture model and is this is a model that people thought this is a really gut brain communication model or actually this is a simplified we really pick up the single cell like epithelial cells and neuronal cells stimulate stimulate with the microbiome. So this is the question I I I kind of confusing and also I I think that the microbiome species and the model system is probably the key for this whole field.",
