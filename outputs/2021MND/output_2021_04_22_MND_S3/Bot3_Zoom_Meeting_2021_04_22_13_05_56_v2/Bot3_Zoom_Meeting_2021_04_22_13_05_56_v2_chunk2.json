But I I do like the idea of working with metabolites with a single molecule because then you're not you know, your readouts aren't in a background of, you know, hundreds if not thousands of different molecules, most of which you're not even interested in. There's an outcome of of of interest and mostly you're not interested in and so more likely to see defined effects or more specific effects that relate back to, you know, the the in vivo system.",

So they can actually use that as a cocktail that's if you identify two molecules based on their algorithm, you can actually put that as a group all those two molecules as a cocktail and then stimulate the cells. I think that may actually narrow down the range. The the however the question is when we use this molecule, we're going to use it with the human resources run all this mouse resources. That is the key because I I believe because we when we pass that, we do say that human cells and mouse cells show the different response.",

Are there uh tissue or or or cells, you know, or any of these again something that you believe is the most at least accessibly physiologic condition. What would be the starting point? Like what would be the kind of the benchmark unit? I don't know what uh whatever scale it is some middle scale. And I think we talked about if I'm answering your question correctly, maybe a single cell analysis from gut tissue, right? Um you know, unless you have again, unless it's a very well worked out system where you know that this side of kind produced by this bacteriphage, you know, uh is the effect is meeting the effect that you're interested in. If it's, you know, novel discovery, I think you just start with single cell or other other single cell sequencing or other cell technologies, right? And then see to what degree you can reproduce those in vivo results in the culture system. But it's probably not it's certainly not perfect. Um but at least you can do this with human tissues as well. And getting back to the previous question, um human versus mouse. I mean, obviously everything is context dependent as pros and cons, but I think one of the the major values of the in vitro systems are that you can use fully human systems, right? You know, if I wanted to do something in humans, you know, it's much easier for me to do you know, let's say if it's novel so it's unethical or not feasible to to actually dose a person with a molecule. Um, I might want to start with an in vitro system that's fully human, right? Because I can always argue I I I can do the mouse system. So so I don't, you know, cells mouse cells in a chip are less valuable at least to me than human cells in.",
