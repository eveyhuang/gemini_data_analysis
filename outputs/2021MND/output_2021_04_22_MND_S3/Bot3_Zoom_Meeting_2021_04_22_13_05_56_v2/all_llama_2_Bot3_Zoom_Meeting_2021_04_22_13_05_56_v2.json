And and and I I do like the idea I mean I think this is really really an interesting space. But I I do like the idea of working with metabolites with a single molecule because then you're not you know, your readouts aren't in a background of, you know, hundreds if not thousands of different molecules, most of which you're not even interested in. There's an outcome of of of interest and mostly you're not interested in and so more likely to see defined effects or more specific effects that relate back to, you know, the the in vivo system.",

So they can actually use that as a cocktail that's if you identify two molecules based on their algorithm, you can actually put that as a group all those two molecules as a cocktail and then stimulate the cells. I think that may actually narrow down the range. The the however the question is when we use this molecule, we're going to use it with the human resources run all this mouse resources.

Like what would be the kind of the benchmark unit? I don't know what uh whatever scale it is some middle scale. And I think we talked about if I'm answering your question correctly, maybe a single cell analysis from gut tissue, right? Um you know, unless you have again, unless it's a very well worked out system where you know that this side of kind produced by this bacteriphage, you know, uh is the effect is meeting the effect that you're interested in. If it's, you know, novel discovery, I think you just start with single cell or other other single cell sequencing or other cell technologies, right? And then see to what degree you can reproduce those in vivo results in the culture system. But it's probably not it's certainly not perfect. Um but at least you can do this with human tissues as well. And getting back to the previous question, um human versus mouse. I mean, obviously everything is context dependent as pros and cons, but I think one of the the major values of the in vitro systems are that you can use fully human systems, right? You know, if I wanted to do something in humans, you know, it's much easier for me to do you know, let's say if it's novel so it's unethical or not feasible to to actually dose a person with a molecule. Um, I might want to start with an in vitro system that's fully human, right? Because I can always argue I I I can do the mouse system.

Um but certain bacteria obviously those that are culturable and depending on their oxygen tolerance can be you know and obviously you can make anaerobic cultures right? You know it's it's surprising at least at least in terms of of theos many many of these cells live quite well under anaerobic conditions. So if you get the conditions right you can model some of the interaction but you won't be able to get all of it right? And it's certainly you know probably what Judith means right is that if you throw one bug let's say you get it to work right? You have a cell culture system that you're very proud of you can get it layers and all the connections right? And you have a bacteria that you add that. But again you know bacteria may behave very differently if it isn't you know if there's maybe some of these other partners that are just in the lab. You know again they're pieces of the puzzle.

And when I think about the complexity and if the goal is finally to understand brain and behavior, um which is big physiological response. I I feel like over overwhelmed and I wonder whether model system in vitro systems will will do it or whether actually going to in silico systems, like kind of like neural network modeling where you don't need to know all the details, but you just need to have this giant model um would um be better suited.

So the thing is this is my valuable question. Um you know, we we we all work on the lab or benchmark, we use the culture models and if like we are so simplified for based on the discussion, we actually um come out the cell culture model. I just really um my question is how how great the society accept the cell culture model and is this is a model that people thought this is a really gut brain communication model or actually this is a simplified we really pick up the single cell like epithelial cells and neuronal cells stimulate stimulate with the microbiome. So this is the question I I I kind of confusing and also I I think that the microbiome species and the model system is probably the key for this whole field.",

So basically when we were thinking about the ideal in vitro system, do we want it to be then screenable or are we going to take that in vitro model and sort through thousands of metabolites and products and figure out what's um stimulating certain changes or we already have let's say 50 different things that we know are doing something potentially, we just want to take the in vitro model and test those 50.

Um I think I'll start with just um giving the point that there are many models that are possible and it really depends on the question that we're asking. If we want to study a very detailed cell based model versus an organ level model. And so there's many different types that um all have their own value. And so we talked about the utility of these different types of models. Like there will be simple models that will enable really high throughput screening. Um and in those it's really important to consider cell subtype specificity, the species selection. Um and the inputs if they're microbiome if they're microbial versus a metabolite or effector molecule. Um and then we also talked about more physiological organ level interactions that can also be modeled. Um yeah, did I is there anything that I missed and I should add in there?
