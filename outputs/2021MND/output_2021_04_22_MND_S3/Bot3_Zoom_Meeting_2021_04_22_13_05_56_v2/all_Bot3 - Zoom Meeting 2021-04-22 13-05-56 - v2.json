So they can actually use that as a cocktail that if you identify 10 molecules based on their algorithm, then you can actually put as a group of this 10 molecules as a cocktail and then stimulate cells. I think about may actually narrow down the range that however, the question is when we use this molecule, we're going to use the human resources or all these mice resources.

If you're interested in a single cell type, how does it respond, or a single receptor, how does it respond? I think it makes a lot more sense to work with mice because you can do cell type specific knockouts and throw that into your complicated multi-tissue system. And then, but you're still going to be missing something, probably. And so then you still have to go back to in vivo or take that to human stuff.
