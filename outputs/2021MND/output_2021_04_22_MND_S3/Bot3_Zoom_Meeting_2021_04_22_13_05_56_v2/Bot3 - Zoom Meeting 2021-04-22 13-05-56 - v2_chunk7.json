Um does it make sense to maybe build out or to think about building out a human and mouse in parallel in virtual systems so that you can compare how well those two perform against each other and then see how well the mouse in virtual system compares to the mouse and the human in virtual system compares to the human. So instead of maybe picking one or the other, um you know, one one additional approach would be to build out both a mouse and human system um just to see the value of the two species and and how how similar or different they are.",

So do do we feel again, I'm not in the microbiome field, but do we feel that we need high throughput systems where we can nominate things to look for cause like like are we in a place where we have a lot of associations and we just want to sort through those and get at the causality of those or are we looking for more leads. So basically when we were thinking about the ideal in vitro system, do we want it to be then screenable or are we going to take that in vitro model and sort through thousands of metabolites and products and figure out what's um stimulating certain changes or we already have let's say 50 different things that we know are doing something potentially, we just want to take the in vitro model and test those 50. Um Like as a field, what's the priority there?",

If we want to study a very detailed cell based model versus an organ level model. And so there's many different types that um all have their own value. And so we talked about the utility of these different types of models. Like there will be simple models that will enable really high throughput screening. Um and in those it's really important to consider cell subtype specificity, the species selection. Um and the inputs if they're microbiome if they're microbial versus a metabolite or effector molecule. Um and then we also talked about more physiological organ level interactions that can also be modeled. Um yeah, did I is there anything that I missed and I should add in there?
