            "transcript": "we actually use the um Alzheimer disease mouse model. We use two mouse models. One is over express APP mutation. Another is APP knocking transgenic mice. We can we can definitely see the different difference between the proteins. the we can definitely see the protein database between the two species and we pick out if we pick up the one model, uh we we we we did the bioinformatic analysis. So we saw a lot of metabolism, amino acid disruption and the the regulation and uh ferroptosis and the uh in the autophagy related cell death and the endocytosis related uh the signaling pathway. They all change uh in the AD in the context of the AD versus white type animals. And I think now we just focus on one of these pathways to manipulate. definitely we need to pick up the good protein, the good candidate to manipulate those uh the signal pathway. I think probably this is one way to think of how we can manipulate or we can actually profile the stress the signaling pathway, we we can manipulate the pathway, yeah.",

            "transcript": "that's a very important point you mentioned that not only now you are saying that whether the stress is microbial related or host related, you are adding the another factor. The factors that increase or decrease resiliency to response to the stress. Age is one of them. It is very clear. Lack of sleep another one. There are lots of other things and the genetic modulation that because if you can increase the resiliency of a stress response, you can have a much easier to disrupt the signaling and vice versa. I can't remember how many more do we have I think we've got more 15 more minutes because I want to make sure we have 10 minutes to summarize things. what I hear from you guys that in fact I like what said that that question make it much easier compared to other question we we had in the last two days to become reductionist to answer. if especially if there is a stress signaling in response to microbial stress that you can be a very reductionist one. But that is one model that you can experimentally take advantage and also see how you can disrupt it. How about the other models to look at the the host related stress. Example PTSD. We know the PTSD cause microbial changes. What do you think? How do you decide which model you are going to use anyone? Lisa, go ahead you are you are the student of the stress response.",

Um so, you know, in terms of I I guess the thing that I have been thinking about though, which is again not not host related, but um is I know that there are actually big changes in um in gene expression between different sorry, my cat is like having a moment. Um different uh kind of expression in in different states of bacteria. So for example, the bacteria that you culture in lab that might be um, you know, planktonic or swimming will have a different genetic signature than one that would be grown as a biofilm in lab. And so one of the things I guess that I've been thinking about is how would you sort of interface that with one of these organoid models. Um and I I don't know the answer, but I think that could be something that would be really interesting to think about.",

I try to imagine the microbiome in a way that you know what if the most prominent species were or more prominent you know file was not bacteriodities. What if it was proteo bacteria, you know like bacteria that could easily easily be genetically modified. The microbiologist in since the last you know 50, 60 years or even more 70 years have mostly focused on developing genetic tools for proteo bacteria like and others. And bacteriodities people didn't really think a lot about. There were like few labs Abigail Saliers and few others who were making mutations in bacteriodities. And then in the last decade or so only now we have some tools to genetically manipulate. Although we can also express certain proteins and we don't have like nice inducible promoters and things like that which work very well still. So what would the microbiome look like if we could manipulate let's say and like you know make mutations within the or so for that. Can we then you know put them in a control system and study stress response and then you know change it essentially if we need to. I mean would that help us understand at least the microbial end of it? I don't know.",

Like it's it's difficult to do genetics in non non model species, but if we had that ability, um that would be that would be one way to start getting a handle on on these questions and I was thinking a lot along the lines of what Lisa was saying, those an organoid type model might be one good way to kind of balance the ability to get reductionist but still have some physiological relevance, right?",
