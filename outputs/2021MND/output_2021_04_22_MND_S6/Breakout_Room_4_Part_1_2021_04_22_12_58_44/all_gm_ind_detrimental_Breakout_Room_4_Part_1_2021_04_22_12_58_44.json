Which are the key species and how these can help uh determine with other factors of course, the trajectories um that characterize the early life microbiome development and how these also impact the host mainly in terms of host immune development, but uh a little bit more recently as well, the programming of the stress axis, which is one of the reasons why I'm really interested in in learning from the the people that do neurobiology here. Um yeah, that's what we do.",

So the research I do is on diet and we can definitely perturb the microbiome with um high fat, high sugar because obviously that's going to change the um microorganisms that are going to feed on that sugar and saturated fat. But I I am fascinated by the fact that we do see differences between males and females and those seem to be pretty consistent within those groups.
