Um I can only speak from what my experiments have told me, but um and obviously this is within mice, so I'm I would love to hear other ideas and input. Um just from my research and from um you know, literature searches, one main aspect here is that um what your microbiome is is kind of stuck in a sense and I think that kind of connects with the presentation that we just listened to that um there's only so much that I can see right now that really can change the microbiome all that much. So the research I do is on diet and we can definitely perturb the microbiome with um high fat, high sugar because obviously that's going to change the um microorganisms that are going to feed on that sugar and saturated fat. But I I am fascinated by the fact that we do see differences between males and females and those seem to be pretty consistent within those groups. Um and then there's certainly the impact of um birth and early exposure and how that kind of just sets you up for life with what your microbiome stays as.",

And um in that case, antibiotics do have a huge impact and we give them in the drinking water for for mice for six weeks, so they're constantly getting antibiotics, but if I think about um, you know, for my kids or something with ear infections and all the antibiotics they've been taking, it's just amazing to think about how static our microbiome can be in general and then those early life exposures to many rounds of antibiotics and how much that can perturb the system.",
