Um and we increased diversity of course because we added a lot of new microbes. Uh but there's a few things that we that we that we showed. Uh still a lot that needs to be learned of course. One of them is that the uh these kids all had gastrointestinal problems and the gastrointestinal problems got better. Most of the kids showed a lot of improvement in behavior too. Um and the behavior improvements remained. We did a follow up two years later and these kids were their behavior was even better in the in the than when we did the treatment. But importantly, when we finished the treatment, we look at how similar was their microbiota to the donor. And when we finished the treatment, the microbiota of these children was more similar to the donor than to another child, okay, that kind of makes sense. We had some engraftment. But two years later, diversity was much higher, but they did not look like the donor at all. They had lost that, you know, similarity to the donor. They had now their new microbiota. Um that some of it some of it probably they just acquire of course from food and from the environment etc. Huge diversity, diversity is higher, but now the question is like, you know, why and how and how is this, you know, affecting the behavior and um if you ask me, we changed the microbiota and we changed the the the microbiota didn't go to the previous state, which was a very dysbiotic one, but I wouldn't say that it was a state a change that remained. Like we we do have this homeostasis in our body that takes it back to a certain state. And so these are some of the questions. I I actually think some of it comes from the biofilm we form when we're infants. Um that sets, you know, sets the sets the the road for future microbiome.

I'm not an ecologist, but for sure, it is only when I read the work from ecologists and what they have done in other ecosystems that I try to draw from some of our questions and and some of our approaches to to understand the early ecology of of the microbiome. The the modulation of the microbiome would be what they would refer to as as um restoration of ecosystems or restoration biology. So there's a few approaches that have been used when, you know, a lake needs to be restored to recover a population of algae, for example. So there's a lot that can be learned and I believe that right now, um the field is not there yet or at least I don't see that very often. We are, I think, learning what are the microbiome changes associated with some patterns of neurological disease. Some of these regarding the early microglia biology seem to me really to be really important. Um and we could start there. We could start focusing on which are the microbes that seem to be triggering or maybe the absence of which microbes seems to be triggering some of these. But but at the end, we need to study microbiomes with microbiomes. The mouse, I don't think, I mean it'll be of course important for proof of concept work, um but at the end, this to me needs to be studied in the human. We study both humans and um mouse mice where I think the the where we want to go, but we're not there yet at least is to try to model these ecosystems in in advanced in vitro systems that can that can hold at least simplified microbiomes, whether they are in in gut organoids or in on organoids on a chip in a system that would allow mimic the the true microbes that that reside in in the human and then study them within the framework of ecology and if we want to change it within the framework of of restoration ecology.
