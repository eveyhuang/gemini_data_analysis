So a more diverse microbiome has less activated microglia and microglia are the immune cells of the brain generally. They're they're basically brain um specific macrophages. There are macrophages and monocytes that enter the brain but microglia play the main role in terms of um surveying and responding to foreign invaders, but they have many other roles and one of them is um is pruning synapses and contributing to potentially neurodegeneration if they're too upregulated or maintaining proper synaptic health. So it's just one feature, but I think it's really cool that there is a correlation between diversity in the microbiome as well as the microglial activation.",

Um it was a modified fecal transplant. They had antibiotics first and then they had a fecal transplant um that they took a dose of microbes for 10 weeks. Um and we increased diversity of course because we added a lot of new microbes. Uh but there's a few things that we that we that we showed. Uh still a lot that needs to be learned of course. One of them is that the uh these kids all had gastrointestinal problems and the gastrointestinal problems got better. Most of the kids showed a lot of improvement in behavior too. Um and the behavior improvements remained. We did a follow up two years later and these kids were their behavior was even better in the in the than when we did the treatment. But importantly, when we finished the treatment, we look at how similar was their microbiota to the donor. And when we finished the treatment, the microbiota of these children was more similar to the donor than to another child, okay, that kind of makes sense. We had some engraftment. But two years later, diversity was much higher, but they did not look like the donor at all. They had lost that, you know, similarity to the donor. They had now their new microbiota. Um that some of it some of it probably they just acquire of course from food and from the environment etc. Huge diversity, diversity is higher, but now the question is like, you know, why and how and how is this, you know, affecting the behavior and um if you ask me, we changed the microbiota and we changed the the the microbiota didn't go to the previous state, which was a very dysbiotic one, but I wouldn't say that it was a state a change that remained. Like we we do have this homeostasis in our body that takes it back to a certain state. And so these are some of the questions. I I actually think some of it comes from the biofilm we form when we're infants. Um that sets, you know, sets the sets the the road for future microbiome. I don't know if anyone wants to elaborate comment or has ideas of how we can actually act on it. Um but I was thinking about hormones, which going back to Linea because of her comments on human um males and females.",

Um whether it's through birth or maybe a traumatic event when you're a child, we know stress changes the microbiome. Um, you know, there've been a lot of studies by um in the Deneden cohort where these children who have stressful events, they have accelerated aging. Um, so something is perturbing the microbiome when they're young and then you sort of need to get stuck there. So I guess the question is how do you change that once you're stuck in this maybe pro-inflammatory um, you know, environment to make it healthier. And you know, I'm interested in the idea of exogenously maybe giving different bacteria that, you know, produce a lot of maybe like a butyrate or some other short chain fatty acid or an indol or something like that. But I don't know that we even know enough which ones to do. It's probably going to take a lot of animal studies to do that. Most interested in the idea of a fage to maybe knock out a bacteria that is bad, but again, I don't think we know enough about what's a good microbiome and a bad microbiome. So how do we even start? Is there some like model disease where we can try, you know, we know a lot about the microbiome as a place to start.",

I'm not an ecologist, but for sure, it is only when I read the work from ecologists and what they have done in other ecosystems that I try to draw from some of our questions and and some of our approaches to to understand the early ecology of of the microbiome. The the modulation of the microbiome would be what they would refer to as as um restoration of ecosystems or restoration biology. So there's a few approaches that have been used when, you know, a lake needs to be restored to recover a population of algae, for example. So there's a lot that can be learned and I believe that right now, um the field is not there yet or at least I don't see that very often. We are, I think, learning what are the microbiome changes associated with some patterns of neurological disease. Some of these regarding the early microglia biology seem to me really to be really important. Um and we could start there. We could start focusing on which are the microbes that seem to be triggering or maybe the absence of which microbes seems to be triggering some of these. But but at the end, we need to study microbiomes with microbiomes. The mouse, I don't think, I mean it'll be of course important for proof of concept work, um but at the end, this to me needs to be studied in the human. We study both humans and um mouse mice where I think the the where we want to go, but we're not there yet at least is to try to model these ecosystems in in advanced in vitro systems that can that can hold at least simplified microbiomes, whether they are in in gut organoids or in on organoids on a chip in a system that would allow mimic the the true microbes that that reside in in the human and then study them within the framework of ecology and if we want to change it within the framework of of restoration ecology.",

Um and then start to perturb them, those those communities in some way and there are a number of things that you can do added, you know, through addition of um of new microbes. Uh you can do subtractive approaches, you can delete microbes from the community using you know, antibiotics if you want broad spectrum or if you want some more selective selective targeting, you can think of engineering peptides or engineering pages. Uh and so I think I mean I I think it's a very exciting uh time for the field. I think but I think it's important to move from all the correlational observations that we've seen of how different microbes correlate with a wide range of diseases and try to develop technologies that allow us to start establishing causal effects. Um and so I think in order to do that you probably have to again grow take that very reductionist approach, start growing bacteria in the lab uh under artificial conditions, which I agree, you know, it's not ideal. Uh but to try to try to start to to to start understanding them and that's how we've always worked with bacteria, right? with pathogens traditionally that's how we gain a lot of the the knowledge that we have today is through through those um those sort of experiments.",

And they did this with with algal polysaccharides which they call it like a sushi paper where you can engraft your strain of choice into a microbiota depending on whether or not they're eating this fiber.",
