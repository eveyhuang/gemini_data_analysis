For as far as I know no one looked at the microbiota directly intervention and time given, but it's a possibility that will have an impact and and it should be seriously consider um at least for all of you guys collecting samples record when you when you are collecting because that can be variable. Um and we know that for example the diet, the time of eating will impact the microbiota in some instances as much as the what we eat.

So there's some really good work out of Justin Sonnenberg's lab with this idea of creating orthogonal carbon niches essentially, kind of assuming that the composition of a microbiota is dependent on the nutrients that are available. If you could provide a completely orthogonal niche, so in other words a fiber in which none of the species of the microbiome normally eat, then you could use that as a means to engraft your organism of choice. And they did this with with algal polysaccharides which they call it like a sushi paper where you can engraft your strain of choice into a microbiota depending on whether or not they're eating this fiber.",

Uh the other one is uh kind of getting out of kind of and I was talking about of this idea of talking about species. Like why do we care so much about species where if what we really want to engraft in is a function or a set of genes, then can we merely deliver those to the microbiome? Can we use horizontal gene transfer either phages or means of conjugation to get stop worrying about engraftment but rather engineer the bugs that are already there.

Uh thinking that like, oh short chain fatty acids or bile acid metabolites are things that the microbiome does to interact with the host. Um but we could also think of using the microbiome as a drug delivery agent where if we can engineer these bugs to make molecules that aren't normally found in humans but could have therapeutic value, that could be another means through which we can engineer the microbiome and again that gets you out of the realm of trying to understand this complex ecosystem and interspecies interaction, but rather just thinking of more traditional drug design where we have a molecule, we want to deliver it and we're going to use bugs in order to make this molecule in situ and that might have some beneficial effect.",
