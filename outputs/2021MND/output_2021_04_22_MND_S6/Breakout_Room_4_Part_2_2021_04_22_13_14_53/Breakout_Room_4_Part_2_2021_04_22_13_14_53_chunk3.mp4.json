I know that in the cardiovascular field, there's been some studies that have now started using field mice even to overcome some of the issues that you brought up, whether they be due to inbreeding or some of the other hurdles we can't overcome in in lab animals. And there it's been shown that some of these same probiotics that work in inbred hypertension models don't have the same effects that they do in these field mice. So yeah, I think that the the the question is great and we need to figure out just how translatable some of these are, but evidence recently suggests that maybe some of them are not going to cross over.",

            "transcript": "I would add that to me at the center of the question or the challenge of the modulation of the microbiome is that we really lack the understand the ecological understanding of the microbiome as what it is, which is an ecosystem. I'm not an ecologist, but for sure, it is only when I read the work from ecologists and what they have done in other ecosystems that I try to draw from some of our questions and and some of our approaches to to understand the early ecology of of the microbiome. The the modulation of the microbiome would be what they would refer to as as um restoration of ecosystems or restoration biology. So there's a few approaches that have been used when, you know, a lake needs to be restored to recover a population of algae, for example. So there's a lot that can be learned and I believe that right now, um the field is not there yet or at least I don't see that very often. We are, I think, learning what are the microbiome changes associated with some patterns of neurological disease. Some of these regarding the early microglia biology seem to me really to be really important. Um and we could start there. We could start focusing on which are the microbes that seem to be triggering or maybe the absence of which microbes seems to be triggering some of these. But but at the end, we need to study microbiomes with microbiomes. The mouse, I don't think, I mean it'll be of course important for proof of concept work, um but at the end, this to me needs to be studied in the human. We study both humans and um mouse mice where I think the the where we want to go, but we're not there yet at least is to try to model these ecosystems in in advanced in vitro systems that can that can hold at least simplified microbiomes, whether they are in in gut organoids or in on organoids on a chip in a system that would allow mimic the the true microbes that that reside in in the human and then study them within the framework of ecology and if we want to change it within the framework of of restoration ecology.",

And uh one um portrait that a collaborator once provided for me has really stuck and that is this continuum between the test tube to mouse to humans. And you gain some and you lose some in each part of this continuum. In the test tube, you get extreme precision, but you lack the complexity of the natural world and in humans, you capture the full complexity, but it's very difficult to precisely perturb the and carry out experiments and the mouse is kind of this intermediate state.",

I raised the question, is it there is no doubt that is extremely important tool for fundamental knowledge of microbiology and immunology and so on. I'm bringing up that the question what is the good model for testing means to modulate microbiota for better health. And I'm not saying that it is not, but I'm saying that one has to put everything together on that aspect of it. Just want to go back to restoration because is a very important point and that would eliminate the issue of bad bacteria, good bacteria or dysbiotic or ubiotic, which we don't know. is restoring the community to the state that was not associated with the pathology. And in fact, the analogy that was mentioned is restoring the habitat in the in the oceans, bring the algae back and so on is a very good analogy. Just want you guys think and expand on it.

So looking at consortia experiments at least through a reductionist lens in the laboratory, looking at growth, how how each bacterium influences each other's growth. Um and then start to perturb them, those those communities in some way and there are a number of things that you can do added, you know, through addition of um of new microbes. Uh you can do subtractive approaches, you can delete microbes from the community using you know, antibiotics if you want broad spectrum or if you want some more selective selective targeting, you can think of engineering peptides or engineering pages. Uh and so I think I mean I I think it's a very exciting uh time for the field. I think but I think it's important to move from all the correlational observations that we've seen of how different microbes correlate with a wide range of diseases and try to develop technologies that allow us to start establishing causal effects. Um and so I think in order to do that you probably have to again grow take that very reductionist approach, start growing bacteria in the lab uh under artificial conditions, which I agree, you know, it's not ideal. Uh but to try to try to start to to to start understanding them and that's how we've always worked with bacteria, right? with pathogens traditionally that's how we gain a lot of the the knowledge that we have today is through through those um those sort of experiments.",
