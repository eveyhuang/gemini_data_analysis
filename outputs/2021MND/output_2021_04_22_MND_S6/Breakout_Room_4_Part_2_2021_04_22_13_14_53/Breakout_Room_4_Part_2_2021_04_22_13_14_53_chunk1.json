It does return quite rapidly back to what it was before. Um and this is quite rapidly after birth and and the changes that characterize pregnancy start happening in the late second trimester. Sorry that's my dog that needs wants to come in. Um and especially in the third trimester and in general, most of these changes um are what in other studies could be associated what some people may call a dysbiotic um microbiome. Um but but like with many things that it is speculated to be an an adaptation to to to the state. It's also associated with um a microbiome that has been linked to obesity so it's is hypothesized to favor the the harvesting of energy to sustain the pregnancy or to sustain a healthy pregnancy.",

            "transcript": "I'll throw one answer and that is um just because it's something I focus on but um so I have an answer but the diversity of the microbiome is correlated with microglial activation. So a more diverse microbiome has less activated microglia and microglia are the immune cells of the brain generally. They're they're basically brain um specific macrophages. There are macrophages and monocytes that enter the brain but microglia play the main role in terms of um surveying and responding to foreign invaders, but they have many other roles and one of them is um is pruning synapses and contributing to potentially neurodegeneration if they're too upregulated or maintaining proper synaptic health. So it's just one feature, but I think it's really cool that there is a correlation between diversity in the microbiome as well as the microglial activation.",

Like if we just treat the bugs that are in the gut as bags that, you know, make molecules and proteins and like it doesn't really matter what they are, right? It's there's some sort of interface that in general is not the bacterium itself that is connecting with the host epithelium, the host immune system.",

Like it's thrown out as an ecological concept, but what what are the bacteria actually doing in that diverse environment?",
