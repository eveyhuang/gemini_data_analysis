And about five, maybe six years ago, um, I got the idea that perhaps some of the inflammation seen with cerebrovascular diseases and cardiovascular diseases in general, uh, might originate from the gut. And ever since then I got the idea, I've I've been in a really rich environment to pursue this, uh, at Baylor and the Texas Medical Center. I'm not sure I could have done what I've done at other schools, but I've I've been ever since I've just indulged in this gut brain axis and it's been exciting.",
