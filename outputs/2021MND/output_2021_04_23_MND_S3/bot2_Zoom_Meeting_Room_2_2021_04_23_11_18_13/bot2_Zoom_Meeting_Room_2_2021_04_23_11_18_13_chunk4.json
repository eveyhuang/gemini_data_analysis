And so um, you know, one idea is whether it would be useful um you know, for the particular experiment of interest to really stick with the non-absorbable antibiotics. So um subsets of them like neomycin, um I think vancomycin are thought to not be absorbed very well whereas other ones are absorbed very well and could have off target effects.
