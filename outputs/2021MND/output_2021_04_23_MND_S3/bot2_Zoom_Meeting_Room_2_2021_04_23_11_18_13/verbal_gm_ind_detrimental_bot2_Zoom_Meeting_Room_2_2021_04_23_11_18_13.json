Like one of the theories behind the periodontal disease, a different PD and Alzheimer's disease is that kind of idea that it's over a long period of time that um that even a very mild infectious process underneath the gums might be um accumulating some kind of neuro neuro pathology um that eventually reaches a threshold and and um leads to Alzheimer's disease. Just the idea that you know, even epidemiologically that people who have tooth loss in their 30s are more likely to have Alzheimer's disease than people who don't. So that idea that somehow either the organisms themselves or inflammatory products over time um reach the brain and cause pathology. I wonder if that kind of addresses what you were asking, Judith.

And so uh when you talk about neuroinflammation, I know we've been talking a lot about the brain but really in the context in the periphery and locally at the site within the gut, there's quite a bit of neuroinflammation and control. And so these what they what they do, right is um they express and also and the and the purpose for for those are to recruit uh immune cells to a particular site to help uh mediate if something's out of you know if there's too many microbes of one kind or another. Um, so the the neurons sense what's happening and and bring more immune cells to the site and thereby directly mediating neuroinflammation. Um, kind of like a conductor, right? And then uh the the idea of of um how that's what what the signal actually is, what's the or the micro bind to to the a neuron, um they have a representation or electrophysiological representation or activity. Um, something called uh like a neurogram if you will like for a particular or particular microbe, which is one of my ideas actually for a project is are there different um activation signatures um in the Vegas for particular microbes that can give you an idea of what's happening and how the brain is affected downstream and this is in the context of whatever disease state you want to think about PD, AD.
