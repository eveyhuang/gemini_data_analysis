So there's no there's no evidence to my knowledge of gut bacteria being viable and trafficking via these anatomical pathways to the brain, but I do think there's some experimental data at least from the oral or nasal microbiome showing that bacteria that are present at those epithelial surfaces uh can traffic across the the barrier and into the the brain and can actually be viable and live there. So it's not coming from the gut, um but it's another microbiome surface uh that that can directly at least shows as an example that that bacteria can can do this. Okay.",

So that's kind of a cool thought that it is possible, but you know, no one's ever shown it. So I think that's also a really cool idea potentially um for for a a grant idea that's kind of far out there. But anyways, um the other yeah, so I was actually talking about this yesterday uh with a couple people that if you because we've done this taking out different um um sensory neuron populations and done some some sequencing and we see um depending on the disease state or pathological state that your sensory neurons can look like, you know, neurons or they can have signatures that look like immune cells and have upregulation of a of a wide variety of different receptors that are typically um uh immune and in nature.",
