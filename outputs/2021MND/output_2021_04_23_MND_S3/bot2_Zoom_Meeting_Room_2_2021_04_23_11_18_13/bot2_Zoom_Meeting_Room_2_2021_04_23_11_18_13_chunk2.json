And again, at least with Parkinson's disease, there's a a plethora now of of samples. So on the order of thousands, I think now that have been sequenced pretty deeply. So we can see not just associations and the presence or absence of particular microbes, but actually enrichments and correlations with different aspects of disease severity, uh things like the constipation phenotypes that happen in in these patient populations. Um, things like severity of the motor symptoms, uh rapid we don't quite have progression yet. Um, you know, PD is is a pretty long disorder that takes a long time to progress. So to my knowledge, we don't have that sort of temporal resolution, but we do have sort of that um cross-sectional uh resolution of of disease severity.",
