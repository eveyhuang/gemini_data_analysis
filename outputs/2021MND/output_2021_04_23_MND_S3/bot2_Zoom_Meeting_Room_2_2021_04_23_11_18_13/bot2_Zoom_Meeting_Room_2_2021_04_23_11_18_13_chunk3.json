Typically those animals uh germ free animals that are genetically predisposed to develop Parkinsonism. Uh, I don't believe they develop Parkinsonism. I'm familiar with studies out to 15 months. So I've often looked at uh a genetic predisposition just waiting on some type of inflammatory response to kick it off. Is that uh what do you think about that? Is there more to it?",

Uh, basically, uh, we are looking at the alpha synuclein related induced uh Parkinson disease or alpha synuclein mutation related to Parkinson disease. Uh, our idea is that, you know, the the the patient actually carry the alpha synuclein they show higher level or they have the alpha synuclein mutation. Uh, so this is the thing so we can really prevent. However, uh, the gut microbiome or the stress from gut actually may form the inflammatory stress that actually track back to the brain which actually further uh stimulate alpha synuclein aggregation or toxicity. That is what we thought. Uh, so we are still uh working on this part and say uh how the what to what extent the gut microbiome or the mitochondria in the gut uh gut system could actually enhance the alpha synuclein pathology in brain. Uh, so we do see something but I I always say this is all be all about the combination. It's not like we cannot say the gut could be the the the damage or stress from gut is causal. We cannot say that. We just say this could actually enhance or promote the later neurodegeneration. It's such as in the alpha synuclein model or in the uh Alzheimer disease model like amyloid beta accumulation.",

So it's not just the microbiome over, you know, a period of adulthood, but do you think that aspects of the microbiome could actually help predispose an animal or person to develop a particular type of disease that doesn't manifest until much, much later. I mean, Parkinson's is an obvious uh uh one, but there are many other diseases where people carry mutations that could predispose them and some people do and some people don't develop develop them, but how how far back in the history of that individual organism does it go?",

And they have to wait until the stress accumulate to certain threshold then actually they cause the disease. So, uh, I always say this is similar to many uh stress the stress they actually they won't uh at the beginning the microbio probably actually as a defense mechanism act as a defense mechanism. However, some of once the bad species of microbio accumulate or imbalance of microbiome in the gut actually just make the the system imbalance and more sensitized. So this is what we thought, yeah.",

Like one of the theories behind the periodontal disease, a different PD and Alzheimer's disease is that kind of idea that it's over a long period of time that um that even a very mild infectious process underneath the gums might be um accumulating some kind of neuro neuro pathology um that eventually reaches a threshold and and um leads to Alzheimer's disease. Just the idea that you know, even epidemiologically that people who have tooth loss in their 30s are more likely to have Alzheimer's disease than people who don't. So that idea that somehow either the organisms themselves or inflammatory products over time um reach the brain and cause pathology. I wonder if that kind of addresses what you were asking, Judith.",

            "transcript": "Yes, look at this. I I can answer the question uh to a point. So the um the interesting thing about um the innervation of the gut is that that it's there there's multiple different kinds of of systems that are there, the inter nervous system, the vagus system and also uh just sensory neurons from the DRGs. But um they all have similar uh functionality in the context of the types of receptors they express and for for a while the idea that there is these this atypical expression pattern of of of um things like kind receptors and other receptors that actually physically and directly bind to microbes themselves um to facilitate um to facilitate an output or physiology is is is a fairly new concept like maybe within the past five to six years. And so uh when you talk about neuroinflammation, I know we've been talking a lot about the brain but really in the context in the periphery and locally at the site within the gut, there's quite a bit of neuroinflammation and control. And so these what they what they do, right is um they express and also and the and the purpose for for those are to recruit uh immune cells to a particular site to help uh mediate if something's out of you know if there's too many microbes of one kind or another. Um, so the the neurons sense what's happening and and bring more immune cells to the site and thereby directly mediating neuroinflammation. Um, kind of like a conductor, right? And then uh the the idea of of um how that's what what the signal actually is, what's the or the micro bind to to the a neuron, um they have a representation or electrophysiological representation or activity. Um, something called uh like a neurogram if you will like for a particular or particular microbe, which is one of my ideas actually for a project is are there different um activation signatures um in the Vegas for particular microbes that can give you an idea of what's happening and how the brain is affected downstream and this is in the context of whatever disease state you want to think about PD, AD. Um, etc etc. Um, because we know that for for a fact that that happens in the context of particular kinds TNF alpha, beta, they have a particular",
