And I'm not sure if we know how stable are the metabolome for the same kind of same kind of genetic background mouse, well control environment, follow them for different day. Do they have the stable metabolome? Can start from there and then can move on to same genetic background but different kind of diet. Then we can study the effect of diet, microbiome and metabolome. And we could just add things step by step.",

I don't know how much microbiome data are in a health system, but if we could use existing data and develop some kind of an algorithm that could help us understand existing human data is really important to me. I'm really interested in how humans are responding, not so much mice because I think mice are a good model for some things, but I just would prefer if we can to use human data.",

Because a lot of these have, you know, neuroactive properties that affect the GI as well and the metabolic impact of the microbiome on the medication and how that then indirectly affects the disease outcome. I heard of an example with PD, but is there like some sort of large scale work getting done on that front, just like interaction of the microbiome with medications in general.",
