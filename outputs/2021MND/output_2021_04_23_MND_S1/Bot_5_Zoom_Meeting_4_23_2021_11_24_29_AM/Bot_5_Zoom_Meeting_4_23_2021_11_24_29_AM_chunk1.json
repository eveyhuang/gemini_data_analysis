You know, fermentation can mean a lot of different things. Um, there's a very specific kind of definition about anaerobic fermentation, no oxygen around. And so in order to extract energy from things, you sort of end up making ethanol or you end up making lactic acid, say in muscle or things like that. But then we also know there's fermentation, there's all kinds of foods that you you allow them to ferment, whatever that means, uh that that makes them stable, sterile over time, things like that, kimchi, you know, all kinds of great things like that. And those are supposed to have uh uh some kind of neurological or mental health benefit as well. And there's a whole gamish of things that are being produced in those. So you have this wide range of things. I I I think microbial fermentation really just sort of means um some kind of biochemical transformation that occurs without oxygen, something like that. Emily, you're probably much more of a chemist than I am. Um, what would you what would you say to add to that?",

Um, one of the hallmarks of microbial fermentation versus fermentation and other or organisms such as ourselves when we do anaerobic metabolism is just the diversity of different processes that they can carry out. The just we tend to think about um metabolism often of of sugar substrates. Microbes can also in the gut ferment things like amino acids. Um, other types of of molecules could also be connected to their anaerobic metabolism, um including dietary um a more unusual dietary um molecules beyond even just polysaccharides or sugars. Um, so um, yeah, so I think I think that that's one of the things that's sort of most unique about this this setting, I think is that there's just a a huge range of metabolism, some of which we may not have even really discovered yet.",

How do you connect that to neurological processes, whether it's, you know, some long-term degenerative thing, maybe it's a short-term thing, addictive behavior, depression uh can come and go, uh whatever it is.

So I guess I'm I'm having trouble kind of decoupling or or maybe I shouldn't decouple the idea of of these metabolic processes and also the things that sort of the bacteria are, you know, using to communicate with one another.

And so uh you can definitely think that many of these are going to be released from the bacteria, you know, classic example of a fermentation product is lactic acid. And lactic acid changes the pH of the environment and does things like that. So it's definitely getting out. So that's there could be some things that require a specific transport process. Uh, but uh, you know, I I I think that um that could be something worth worth looking into. But I think in general it's it's more a question of the, you know, the product and how does it interact with the host to cause some kind of um neurological effect.",
