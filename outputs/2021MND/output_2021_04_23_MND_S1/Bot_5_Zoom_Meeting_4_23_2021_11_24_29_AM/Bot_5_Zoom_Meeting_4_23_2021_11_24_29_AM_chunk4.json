This is massive and if we can identify some of these connections between, you know, constipation and mental health, that just seems like a huge impact that if if we could do something that sheds light on that, I I think that's really exciting.",

I went to a gero science conference like a year and a half ago and it's called the Silver Tsunami, which I love that name. Um but basically is there some underlying thing that's triggering all of aging? And we know that age is associated with a change in the microbiome, a reduction in say short chain fatty acids or what else. Um could age associated changes in the microbiome be driving all of aging and all of those diseases, metabolic, brain dysfunction. I think that's like a super a really big, super cool question.

Um Calvin, you were mentioning what type of models, but there's also what models could be used, for example, cellular tissue organisms, um to kind of prioritize, you know, which metabolites or bacteria may actually matter. I mean, we could start off by just simple um you know, uh statistical approaches. I'm sure many of you have heard principle component analysis and all that is is just like takes a high dimensional data space, reduces it down to like, you know, how small tractable number like 10 or so, most most of the time two or three. Um and these components which they're called Latin variables, they're all independent of each other or you know, based on math, they're they're independent of each other. So basically are those and then if you look at those principle components, which are just a function of all these, you know, um different types of metabolites, maybe do those map in regards to linking to like a phenotype or a disease or a clinical endpoint. I mean, there's many ways to do this from a, you know, from a bioinformatic standpoint, but you know, more of the wet lab, the bench standpoint, like for example, cellular tissue organism models, mouse models, etc. And I think Robin mentioned",
