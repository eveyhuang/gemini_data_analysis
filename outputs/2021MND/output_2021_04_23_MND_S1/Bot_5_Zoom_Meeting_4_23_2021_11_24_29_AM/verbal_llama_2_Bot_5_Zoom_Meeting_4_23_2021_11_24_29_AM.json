But no matter how you do, no matter which metabolite or metabolite pattern you are looking at, you need the output. You need to you need to need some experimental result to help correlate the two of them. And apparently we want to start with a specific phenotype, either disease or brain imaging as the phenotype and then to screen many metabolite patterns. I'm I'm that's a question. I hopefully I'm thinking if there's an easy experimental model can help us screen many metabolite or metabolite pattern. It will be very useful at least for one specific disease. ",

So you can generate intestinal epithelial cells, neurons, you know, a lot of different cell types. The question is what what's the most appropriate readout? Like, for instance, with neurons, are you looking for neuronal activity? Are you looking for secretion of a particular cytokine or growth factor? Are you looking for a switch in the metabolic state? And so, you know, the first one, the activity readout is scalable, so you can do that high throughput. But if you're looking for a global switch in the metabolic state, that's not scalable, right? So maybe you can start with some scalable readouts, you have 100 candidates, narrow that down to five, and then for those five, look at how those five affect the metabolic shift in the neurons. And then from there, test them on mouse models. So like a sequential study with different degrees of complexity. ",

Like, for example, this is like a philosophical question. But what do we know? What is the actual healthy state? What is the the host healthy state? This is something my lab thinks about a lot. What is the actual state that we want to induce? And do all these chemicals and all these, you know, functions actually matter towards getting us closer to that that endpoint of normal brain activity? I don't know how you define normal, but healthy brain activity, you know?
