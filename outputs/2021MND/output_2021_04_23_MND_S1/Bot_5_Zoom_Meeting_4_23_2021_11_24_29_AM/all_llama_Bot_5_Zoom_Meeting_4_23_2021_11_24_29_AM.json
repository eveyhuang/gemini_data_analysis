You know, fermentation can mean a lot of different things. Um, there's a very specific kind of definition about anaerobic fermentation, no oxygen around. And so in order to extract energy from things, you sort of end up making ethanol or you end up making lactic acid, say in muscle or things like that. But then we also know there's fermentation, there's all kinds of foods that you you allow them to ferment, whatever that means, uh that that makes them stable, sterile over time, things like that, kimchi, you know, all kinds of great things like that. And those are supposed to have uh uh some kind of neurological or mental health benefit as well. And there's a whole gamish of things that are being produced in those. So you have this wide range of things. I I I think microbial fermentation really just sort of means um some kind of biochemical transformation that occurs without oxygen, something like that.

The just we tend to think about um metabolism often of of sugar substrates. Microbes can also in the gut ferment things like amino acids. Um, other types of of molecules could also be connected to their anaerobic metabolism, um including dietary um a more unusual dietary um molecules beyond even just polysaccharides or sugars. Um, so um, yeah, so I think I think that that's one of the things that's sort of most unique about this this setting, I think is that there's just a a huge range of metabolism, some of which we may not have even really discovered yet.",

I mean, we could start off by just simple um you know, uh statistical approaches. I'm sure many of you have heard principle component analysis and all that is is just like takes a high dimensional data space, reduces it down to like, you know, how small tractable number like 10 or so, most most of the time two or three. Um and these components which they're called Latin variables, they're all independent of each other or you know, based on math, they're they're independent of each other. So basically are those and then if you look at those principle components, which are just a function of all these, you know, um different types of metabolites, maybe do those map in regards to linking to like a phenotype or a disease or a clinical endpoint. I mean, there's many ways to do this from a, you know, from a bioinformatic standpoint, but you know, more of the wet lab, the bench standpoint, like for example, cellular tissue organism models, mouse models, etc. And I think Robin mentioned",

The question is what what's the most appropriate readout? Like, for instance, with neurons, are you looking for neuronal activity? Are you looking for secretion of a particular cytokine or growth factor? Are you looking for a switch in the metabolic state? And so, you know, the first one, the activity readout is scalable, so you can do that high throughput. But if you're looking for a global switch in the metabolic state, that's not scalable, right? So maybe you can start with some scalable readouts, you have 100 candidates, narrow that down to five, and then for those five, look at how those five affect the metabolic shift in the neurons. And then from there, test them on mouse models. So like a sequential study with different degrees of complexity.",

Like, for example, this is like a philosophical question. But what do we know? What is the actual healthy state? What is the the host healthy state? This is something my lab thinks about a lot. What is the actual state that we want to induce? And do all these chemicals and all these, you know, functions actually matter towards getting us closer to that that endpoint of normal brain activity? I don't know how you define normal, but healthy brain activity, you know?
