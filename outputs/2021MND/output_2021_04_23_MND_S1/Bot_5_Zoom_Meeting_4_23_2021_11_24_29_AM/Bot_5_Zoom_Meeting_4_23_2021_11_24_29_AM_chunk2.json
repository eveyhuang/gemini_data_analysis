So for example, um uh hunger hormones like um uh ghrelin, leptin and such. Um those have been found um I don't know if it's in humans but definitely in mouse um that gut microbes somehow stimulate uh for example ghrelin and then that affects the brain and then it makes the mouse more hungry.

You do run into problems with kind of the idea that the presence of a gene is not the same as the presence of functional activity. Um, this is where some different kind of of course the chemical biologist would say this, chemical biology techniques come in. Um, so like activity based protein profiling, you can identify the functionally active proteins, but you need to have an idea of what specific kind of functional activity you're looking for.",
