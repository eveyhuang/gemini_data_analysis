I'm sure many of you have heard principle component analysis and all that is is just like takes a high dimensional data space, reduces it down to like, you know, how small tractable number like 10 or so, most most of the time two or three. Um and these components which they're called Latin variables, they're all independent of each other or you know, based on math, they're they're independent of each other. So basically are those and then if you look at those principle components, which are just a function of all these, you know, um different types of metabolites, maybe do those map in regards to linking to like a phenotype or a disease or a clinical endpoint.
