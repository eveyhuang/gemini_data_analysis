So you can generate intestinal epithelial cells, neurons, you know, a lot of different cell types. The question is what what's the most appropriate readout? Like, for instance, with neurons, are you looking for neuronal activity? Are you looking for secretion of a particular cytokine or growth factor? Are you looking for a switch in the metabolic state? And so, you know, the first one, the activity readout is scalable, so you can do that high throughput. But if you're looking for a global switch in the metabolic state, that's not scalable, right? So maybe you can start with some scalable readouts, you have 100 candidates, narrow that down to five, and then for those five, look at how those five affect the metabolic shift in the neurons. And then from there, test them on mouse models. So like a sequential study with different degrees of complexity. ",

And do all these chemicals and all these, you know, functions actually matter towards getting us closer to that that endpoint of normal brain activity?
