So the microbiome obviously generates a lot of metabolic end products and and some of which have uh been well characterized to have um, you know, important functions uh and influence the host. You know, how are these uh species related um to neurological disorders? Uh, is the connection direct uh or or indirect? Um, try to think if there's any more uh yeah, so that that kind of covers covers what we're we're tasked with uh thinking about. Um, you know, what are the roles of these these molecules? What are the important molecules? How are they working? And yeah, George, do we want to start by having everybody just like kind of take that minute to think about the discussion topics before opening it up?",
