So really get a a global understanding of um of uh patients with autoimmune disease, uh rheumatoid arthritis and vasculitis in particular and basically try to find biomarkers for prognostics and diagnostics. Um, on more of the kind of like the computational biologist/ basic science side, we're interested in um uh chemical ecology and also uh looking at uh different types of um uh small molecules that microbes can create but as a community rather than focusing on one bug at a time. And we're trying to link those two together being like, okay, what molecules can these kind of particular gut microbiome influence the onset or, you know, mediation of autoimmune uh disease.",
