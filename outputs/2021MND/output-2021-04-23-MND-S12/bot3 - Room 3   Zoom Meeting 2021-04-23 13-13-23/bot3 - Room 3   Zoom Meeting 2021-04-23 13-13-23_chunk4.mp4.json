She showed, I think it was a couple years ago in Nature Micro, I think, where it was actually if they were a group of microbes that were deficient in an enzyme called like TMA lyase, there were other gut microbes that could basically engage in alternative metabolic processing of those natural byproducts to generate TMA endogenously even the absence of the the native enzyme that catalyzes that transformation. So, I think it's not just one like like the classic one bug one metabolite but also you know, sort of how to different different, you know, groups of bacteria communicate either in a stochastic manner or in a program manner to generate all of these factors.",

            "transcript": "actually, so succinate and tough cells is an example of this. We know that tons of bacteria make succinate. But actually colonic tough tough cells don't respond to succinate. It's small intestinal tough tough cells that respond to succinate. And that actually makes sense. So the organization of the system is such that we've evolved to avoid sensing the microbial succinate and segregated the expression of the receptor to sense it away from the bacteria. And I think actually that's mostly the design principle is for us to try to design in the majority of cases uh systems where we're not being manipulated by these constant signals or noise. Um the same goes for actually this is a subject I've been fascinated by for a while is that, you know, we secrete tons and tons and tons of um monoamine oxidase into the lumen of the gut. Um mostly this isn't really taught, but actually in the gut lumen there's tons and tons and tons of monoamine oxidase. Um which presumably is there to basically degrade all of these signals before they even get to us. Um of course on the flip side there are going to be those instances that we've evolved to sense things to either to monitor the structure or function of the microbial community or the integrity of the barrier. But I think actually those are the exceptions to the rule. The rule is that we try to not have this these things muck with our gears. Um and then choose a small subset of them to actually monitor and respond to that's kind of our our the sentinel signal. I don't know, but yeah if other people agree with that kind of point of view, but that's kind of my point of view.",

But I don't know that anybody has systematically gone through and you know, engineered particular bugs and then made a Shaler's flora, which is a community uh microorganisms some sort of Shaler's flora and then put it back and then asked where do different ones go and does it do they go different places if they're making something that you want them to make. Which I think is a really critical question if you're thinking about using um uh microbiome as a therapeutic, you would want to know where particular organisms go or uh you know what excuse me, what sort of environment they would be in at any rate because that might make a difference on whether the products would become accessible to use as a therapeutic or not.

I mean we can transplant a whole community and see our phenotype move along with it. But the approaches that we've been taking recently is kind of a a reductionist approach. So we've been doing dilutions of our complex community and then seeing which of those dilutions carry forward the phenotype. Um and then further dilute them in order to make the community more simple and just continue to do this um until we hopefully get down to a a much more simplified community that still carries the phenotype we can then look at not only who's there but what are they producing.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I think both the both the gross and fine level spatial organization is going to be critical to understand. It's just a pain in the ass to actually do. Um I mean I think there's been some there are kind of anecdotal ways that people have somewhat done this where you do track particular bugs by fish in terms of where they get um you know, are they going into the intermucus layer but you know, kind of the more fine scale resolution is difficult. I I think one thing one other maybe related somewhat to at least what what um Judith is alluding to um of you know, again bioavailability, controlling bioavailability. I think it's important to remember that most of these things are actually absorbed via active transport um via channels. It's not that they're just magically going across the barrier and so um small intestinal versus large intestinal organization is also really critical because many more chemicals will actually be absorbed um in the small intestine and so the you know, you can imagine scenarios where if you have aberrant expansion of taxa in the small intestine that are making chemicals bioactive compounds that that may have very different effects than that than they would have if they had stayed in the colon where that that chemical just isn't transported or absorbed at all. Um so I think it's a really important point that we need to always keep in mind that all plays into this question of, you know, the key million dollar question of are these things actually make it to the making it to the places where we think they might be biologically relevant at concentrations that are sufficient to engage whatever host systems. Um which is one that yeah, again is often hard really hard to answer and we answer it using the proxies of some sort of um change in phenotype. But often those are just proxies.",
