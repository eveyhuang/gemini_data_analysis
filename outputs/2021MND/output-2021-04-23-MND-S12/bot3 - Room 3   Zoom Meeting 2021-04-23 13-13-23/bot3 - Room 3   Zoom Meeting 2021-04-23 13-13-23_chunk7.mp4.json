Like any I can't speak to it personally, but at least by proxy knowing that this is a pretty powerful um thing. And you can yeah, you so you can certainly imagine gut microbes either, I mean people have put forward that idea of their that they're actually manipulating it purposefully, but I think you can also maybe not you know, imply purpose and still imagine that they would they would have some effect on this and maybe in an unintended effect.

So both of those also have other associations. So hard to say if it's the transit or if it's something that happens along the way that's just slower or it's all very confusing to me actually.",
