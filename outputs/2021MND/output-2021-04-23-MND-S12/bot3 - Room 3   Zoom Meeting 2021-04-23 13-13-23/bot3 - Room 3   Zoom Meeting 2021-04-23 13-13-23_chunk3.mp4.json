So you kind of get those multiple steps along the pathway and like you're saying looking in portal but then also in systemic as well so you see uh what has the potential to be actually making it all the way to brain.",

So that you see things that might that microbes are making in vitro. Um but you know, we've evolved systems uh to regulate the bioavailability of of compounds like catecholamines for obvious reasons you can't have a bunch of uh dopamine or epinephrin floating around the body all the time. So anything that you need to regulate the bioavailability of you don't just regulate production, you regulate um uh also the degradation. And so I think yeah, we we you can end up with a lot of false positives if you're just looking at what microbes can make um as in terms of what will actually be physiologically making it to the places where we're interested. Uh same with blood brain barrier of course, right?",

So, you know, generally if you're thinking about a synaptic effect, you want a really high concentration of a particular transmitter in a very small area and it's such a small area, it's not even very many molecules of it and it has to be there rapidly because if it's not there rapidly, it's going to desensitize. So you could you could certainly think of all sorts of desensitization processes going on and every every neurotransmitter has some sort of re uptake process. So you can imagine that uh systemic neurotransmitters that could get through the blood brain barrier maybe rather than working synaptically are are altering um re uptake. So altering levels of excitation or inhibition or ratios of excitation and inhibition which I thought to be very, very important in in many sort of uh neurodevelopmental disease processes, probably other processes too.",

You can make like electrode to be pretty small in size to be smaller than synaptic cleft. So then you have to put them around there, right? So so the methodology uh we we actually this is not a big direction my lab. So we are um developing nanometer positioning platform, which is scanning probe technology. You can position the sensing probe with nanometer resolution. Um so so we did that with the colinergic transmitters from California model. So we basically learned that the concentration of colinergic transmitters is like two molar. It's really dynamically changing. It's not like a flat level. So the highest level we get is like two molar. Um, so overall, you know, there are studies also uh based on like extracellular studies and simulation also tells that information as well. But I you know, I totally agree with like you know, Judith just mentioned besides synaptic transmission, there is also like volume transmission as well. like release from the cells, those also matters a lot. in the brain, so.",

But one of the things that does seem to be true is that um, you know, many of chemicals including what are used by us as neurotransmitters that are made by bacteria are made at incredibly high levels. I mean that they're just pumping out constantly millimolar quantities of these things. And so that, you know, does I think give the opportunity to end up with physiologically relevant concentrations of compounds um even if, you know, our system is set up to have it be exquisitely controlled at this synapse, um, you know, if a bug is spitting out as a waste product GABA um at millimolar quantities all the time, um, you know, that's a pretty remarkable level of that neurotransmitter that's being produced.",
