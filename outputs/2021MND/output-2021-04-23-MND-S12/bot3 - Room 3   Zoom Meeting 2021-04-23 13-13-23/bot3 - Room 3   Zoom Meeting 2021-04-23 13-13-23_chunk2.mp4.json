Um you know, this last couple of days I've started to think about, you know, you know, this idea of true bidirectionality. So like how can the brain actually influence other immune mediators in the gut or elsewhere. Um in your in your work, is there any suggestion that things like, you know, alterations to like the HPA axis or any of these sort of effector molecules produced by the brain uh usually sort of endocrine in nature is sort of what I'm thinking. Have you encountered that they might affect sort of the gut microbita or any immune effectors down there?",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I mean, I think there's definitely um lots of possibilities there and you know, one of the scenarios where we know these kinds of things can occur is um in the case of stress. Um, for example, so one of my colleagues here at Yale recently had a really nice paper showing this isn't gut brain in this case, but uh but brain uh immune connection where he showed actually that stress can lead to um uh a nervous system mediated activation of adipocytes to release IL6, um an inflammatory cytokine. Um, I think there's also some really interesting, I was talking about this in the last group as well actually. Um, you know, examples of uh even uh conditioning of immune responses, so classical conditioning of immune responses, again suggesting true bidirectional communication because basically uh, you know, what what one of the things that was shown a couple decades ago, um is that you can condition allergic responses. Uh, so if you give a neutral stimulus, ring a bell and give an allergen, ring a bell and give an allergen, ring a bell and give an allergen, eventually you can ring the bell and all the mass cells in the body will degranulate um without the allergen being present. Um, so that really truly does suggest bidirectional because this type this information had to be encoded from the immune cells being the initial responders, um presumably, although could be direct neuronal sensing as well. There's now evidence for that, but at least the model at the time was that it's initially the mass cells that are sensing, talking to the neurons, the neurons talking to the brain, eventually the brain learning that the proper response to this stimulus um is uh is an allergic response and then encoding that as a learned behavior. Um, and becomes almost an anticipatory behavior and you have these kind of anecdotes of people who are the the famous story my PI used to tell was that he had a uh he had a friend who who insisted that she was allergic to the sight of her of her ex-boyfriend. Um, that she would see him and start to, you know, break out in hives. And um, yeah, so anyway that I probably other people on this can comment maybe even better than I can, but I I think definitely there's lots of opportunities for that kind of bidirectional communication and you can imagine that happening in the gut as well.",

There's just a huge overlap, this kind of common chemical languages. Um so what you really want to know is what's actually coming from the microbes in the gut. And so Andrew Mcpherson did this experiment where they did heavy labeling of um of microbes and then did a colon irreversible colonization of germ free mice. So these were auxotrophic bacteria that um couldn't grow on their own unless they have, you know, the the right supplements. Um, so basically they were able to put in these bacteria that were heavy labeled and then track all of the metabolites specifically that had come from those bacteria across the body. Um, this was maybe a year ago or something that they published this. So I thought this was to I think this is a yeah, one very, very elegant, expensive but elegant way to actually prove uh a microbial origin um for those kinds of compounds. They didn't really do it and I don't think they actually looked in the brain at all. They only looked in circulation. Um, but other groups have done the typical kind of shotgun metabolomics in the brain and you can kind of guess that maybe things are coming from the microbiota, but not proven.",
