But like, you know, the same a similar composition might give you totally different phenotypes in a in two hosts, right? And so like maybe there are metabolomic ways of, uh, of doing precision medicine that that where key metabolites are measured and you can say, okay, well, you know, if this person has a lot of build up of X, you know, it means that means something about metabolism of whatever drug of the of the line.

And then if you can eliminate, if you know which bacteria are making the metabolites of interest, you can then knock down the level and then and then rescue. Um and then and then you wouldn't be saturated anymore. But it's quite possible a lot of the metabolites are saturating at the steady state. So if there's some signal that's being transmitted from the gut to the brain, like how close is it to saturation? So like if could we do an experiment where we added more of the, you know, the ligand and then we see would it go would whatever we're measuring would it go up or are we basically like a normal person is always saturated and it's only these cases where we get some kind of depletion, something's wrong where where we see an effect in which case, you know, there's certain kind of studies that that we're limited to you know what we can do. So if and we'd have to do deletion experiments and then the deletion experiments seem like they're really hard. Mark was talking about like using fage, um, but then again that's like you have to design a fage for each species. Um, is it like could we, you know, do like kind of combinatorial like chemical libraries, uh, like just go straight to the metabolites or is there like J talked about like is there a list, a prioritized list of metabolites um that we could kind of come up with um that we could kind of add in more and see, you know, give each one to see if it changes our output or is it like or or is there a way chemically to deplete certain things like you design an enzyme to break um whatever metabolite you're looking for, I don't know. those ways. But maybe just think in terms of inputs and outputs uh and and it's kind of like what does does are we in a linear are we in a linear regime or are we, you know, kind of in one of these uh sigmoid things where we're saturated or we're just like off for a long period and then before we go up at all.",

So um uh I'm excited to see that in the last couple of years that there's been um an increasing appreciation in the literature for the importance of measuring redox potential of the microbiome and also the difficulty of measuring this. Um that is uh when um there have been studies about redox potential in microbial communities for decades, but there's also a huge body of literature that talks about how hard it is to have reproducibility across experiments. So like if you have a redox potential measured in one study, it's probably reasonable to be consistent within a study, but across studies, the numbers that they change by like or like uh orders of magnitude of 10 or 100 um that are um that are dramatic. And one of the things that um I'm interested in if anyone has comments on this is um how can we measure metal ions better in the gut and in real time? And this has been a huge challenge in the chemical biology field. Um this is really hard with iron um in in the like in a complex system um where we are is like synchotron is the only way you can actually measure um iron speciation as far as I know right now um in um biological systems. So it's like doable, but it's not does anybody know how to use one? I don't. I know you can like get time on these, but um it's really complicated. And so it would be um interesting to think about ways to be able to better measure speciation in vivo.",
