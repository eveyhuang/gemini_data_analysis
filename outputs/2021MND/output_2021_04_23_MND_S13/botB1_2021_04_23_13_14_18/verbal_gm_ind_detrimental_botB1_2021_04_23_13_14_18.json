Um that is uh when um there have been you know studies about redox potential in microbial communities for decades, but there's also a huge body of literature that talks about how hard it is to have reproducibility across experiments. So could you have a redox potential measured in one study, it's probably reasonable to be consistent within a study, but across studies, the numbers that they change by like or like uh orders of magnitude of 10 or 100 um that are um that are dramatic. And one of the things that um I'm interested in if anyone has comments on this is um how can we measure metal ions better in the gut and in real time and this has been a huge challenge in the chemical biology field. Um this is really hard with iron um in in the like in a complex system um where we are is like synchrotron is the only way you can actually measure um iron speciation as far as I know right now um in um biological systems. So it's like doable, but it's not does anybody know how to use one? I don't. I know you can like get time on these, but um it's really complicated. And so it would be um interesting to think about ways to be able to better measure speciation in vivo. ",

Uh, but usually the concern there is like it's fine for the person, but after they excrete it then where does it go? And that's where the EPA gets in and that's where the concerns uh really are. And also for the ethical dilemma of like, well, you could spread a microbiome from one person to another if you're in the same household and even if person A is sick and is perfectly fine with eating an engineered bug, but you know, their brother or sister or spouse or kid is not and it transfers to them, then they've been unknowingly dosed with a drug.
