And my group is essentially uh a synthetic biology microbiome group. So we're really interested in using strategies or tools that are afforded by synthetic biology or engineering bugs uh to answer studies in the microbiome that are difficult to understand now uh by making genetic perturbations in intractable bugs. Um, and also to do kind of the same uh sort of living biotherapeutic route. Um, we also have uh a handful of projects in the lab dealing with bacteriaphage and using those as viruses to manipulate the microbiome either to eliminate specific species or to uh deliver you know, genetic payloads to different bugs to change them.",
