If it goes through a cell, this could change like oxidation state as opposed to between cell. And uh this is something we've struggled with in the lab, like thinking about how do you actually track those specific molecules that are getting produced where it's more obvious if it's an exogenous source that you're providing, like a carbon, we can use C13 labels too, but how do you do that in vivo um and follow where it goes?

So could you have a redox potential measured in one study, it's probably reasonable to be consistent within a study, but across studies, the numbers that they change by like or like uh orders of magnitude of 10 or 100 um that are um that are dramatic.

Um this is really hard with iron um in in the like in a complex system um where we are is like synchrotron is the only way you can actually measure um iron speciation as far as I know right now um in um biological systems. So it's like doable, but it's not does anybody know how to use one? I don't. I know you can like get time on these, but um it's really complicated.
