When you think about the molecules that are produced endogenously, it does get really tricky to me to think about, well, even if it's getting produced, where does it go from there? Is it going between cells? Like is it across the epithelium? Is it going through a cell, which could matter in terms of um we think a lot about oxidation state. If it goes through a cell, this could change like oxidation state as opposed to between cell. And uh this is something we've struggled with in the lab, like thinking about how do you actually track those specific molecules that are getting produced where it's more obvious if it's an exogenous source that you're providing, like a carbon, we can use C13 labels too, but how do you do that in vivo um and follow where it goes?

So um I'm excited to see that in the last couple of years that there's been um an increasing appreciation in the literature for the importance of measuring redox potential of the microbiome and also the difficulty of measuring this. Um that is uh when um there have been you know studies about redox potential in microbial communities for decades, but there's also a huge body of literature that talks about how hard it is to have reproducibility across experiments. So could you have a redox potential measured in one study, it's probably reasonable to be consistent within a study, but across studies, the numbers that they change by like or like uh orders of magnitude of 10 or 100 um that are um that are dramatic. And one of the things that um I'm interested in if anyone has comments on this is um how can we measure metal ions better in the gut and in real time and this has been a huge challenge in the chemical biology field. Um this is really hard with iron um in in the like in a complex system um where we are is like synchrotron is the only way you can actually measure um iron speciation as far as I know right now um in um biological systems. So it's like doable, but it's not does anybody know how to use one? I don't. I know you can like get time on these, but um it's really complicated.

You see, um but yeah, bacteria do secrete siderophores in uh the the microbiome.

So you know you have a difference, but is the disease state, say if it's got a reduced level of short chain fatty acids in the circulation, is that still saturation for that that person? Um, and is there a way that we can overcome that? Uh or would the way that we deliver said drug, if it's a short chain fatty acid for example, if we just feed that into the diet versus uh changing the microbiota so that we increase short chain fatty acid capability from the from the microbiota itself, does does that have an effect on the pharmacokinet pharmacodynamics of the drug's stability or access to a different tissue site. Um, and then finally, this conversation about metal ions, there's a lot that sort of was happening while I was trying to get these notes um together, but it sounded like ultimately really there are indications that the microbiota has something to do with uh heavy metal metabolism. There's a lot that we don't understand and technically we don't we don't understand it because there are so many technical challenges just in terms of measurement, reporting across studies and one thing that could really advance the field here would be sensors for metal content and species uh in vivo in real time. And then within that looking for whether or not these heavy metals are acting as electron acceptors or versus enzyme cofactors. How do we feel about this?",

Um, and it's kind of very indirect. They are um associated with neurological diseases. Um, but they're not necessarily associated with the microbiome, but it's at least another thought of maybe we don't even need to understand really what's going on and really just use the microbiome as an agent through which we could engineer the metabolome of the host.

So I think the um, I think the thing is if someone's sick and they're going to die, uh there's a lot more tolerance for trying to save them in whatever way possible, even if that means introducing an engineered bug. Um, and for most of these engineered bugs, there are a number of either kill switches or oxytrophies that are put in to make sure that they won't get released. Uh, but usually the concern there is like it's fine for the person, but after they excrete it then where does it go? And that's where the EPA gets in and that's where the concerns uh really are. And also for the ethical dilemma of like, well, you could spread a microbiome from one person to another if you're in the same household and even if person A is sick and is perfectly fine with eating an engineered bug, but you know, their brother or sister or spouse or kid is not and it transfers to them, then they've been unknowingly dosed with a drug. So there's definitely some ethical um issue there, but regardless it seems like, you know, they're trying to grapple with the the ethics both on the environmental and the medical side of that and it's all moving forward uh at least from my opinion.
