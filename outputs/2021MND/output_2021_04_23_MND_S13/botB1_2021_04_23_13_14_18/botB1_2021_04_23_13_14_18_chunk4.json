So looking at the transcriptional profile or the metabolomic profile, that might be a little bit more informative for for what's occurring.",

So um I'm excited to see that in the last couple of years that there's been um an increasing appreciation in the literature for the importance of measuring redox potential of the microbiome and also the difficulty of measuring this. Um that is uh when um there have been you know studies about redox potential in microbial communities for decades, but there's also a huge body of literature that talks about how hard it is to have reproducibility across experiments. So could you have a redox potential measured in one study, it's probably reasonable to be consistent within a study, but across studies, the numbers that they change by like or like uh orders of magnitude of 10 or 100 um that are um that are dramatic. And one of the things that um I'm interested in if anyone has comments on this is um how can we measure metal ions better in the gut and in real time and this has been a huge challenge in the chemical biology field. Um this is really hard with iron um in in the like in a complex system um where we are is like synchrotron is the only way you can actually measure um iron speciation as far as I know right now um in um biological systems. So it's like doable, but it's not does anybody know how to use one? I don't. I know you can like get time on these, but um it's really complicated. And so it would be um interesting to think about ways to be able to better measure speciation in vivo.",

So what the the thought is is we make an assumption in the field that iron is mostly in the reduced state in the gut because the gut is a reducing environment, but um but there are times when there is more iron three, the oxidized form, which could happen through inflammation, um through you know production of Ross or nitric oxides. You see, um but yeah, bacteria do secrete siderophores in uh the the microbiome. The human also secretes enzymes to capture uh iron three, reduce it to iron two so that it can be brought inside of cells. But I think we have a poor understanding of the dynamics of that.",
