My my group um uh is interested in um metabolism, how the gut microbiome changes metabolisms and might change um energy extraction by the host, but we also have done a lot of work with autism and the microbiome.

When you think about the molecules that are produced endogenously, it does get really tricky to me to think about, well, even if it's getting produced, where does it go from there? Is it going between cells? Like is it across the epithelium? Is it going through a cell, which could matter in terms of um we think a lot about oxidation state. If it goes through a cell, this could change like oxidation state as opposed to between cell. And uh this is something we've struggled with in the lab, like thinking about how do you actually track those specific molecules that are getting produced where it's more obvious if it's an exogenous source that you're providing, like a carbon, we can use C13 labels too, but how do you do that in vivo um and follow where it goes?

I think it connects with what you were just saying too and this is so outside of my area, something I want to listen and get information because I have a lot to learn here, but um in terms of crossing the blood brain barrier, that might not be a major like it's certainly a question, but we don't know if there's um small molecules that are traveling that need to get past the blood brain barrier or if for example, we're talking about serotonin activation that's happening in the gut that could then um stimulate the vagus nerve and that would then send a signal to the brain and then you know, we might not have to get past the blood brain barrier based on who knows if it's a neurotransmitter like dopamine or serotonin produced in the gut. Again, I have way more questions than any answers, but we don't even know which route or both or which one matters or so it could be vagus nerve, it could be humoral, I don't know.

Oh, it doesn't make it into the blood brain, so it's not directly acting in those sort of contexts.

Um, my plan is to use precision medicine approaches to approach neurodevelopmental conditions to try to understand them better, but my PhD work was in the neuroscience of the gut, which has sort of brought me back around to this question of um, you know, sort of microbiome and neurodevelopmental conditions. I have to be honest with you, for most other sessions, I've felt I've been able to follow and it's probably because I came a little late, but um, sort of the level of the scientific discussion has been a bit above me, which is in part why I haven't jumped in yet. So it's been part of what I've really enjoyed about this dialogue is that I truly have learned so much and like my day-to-day, I think looks very different from a lot of you, so, um, I don't have anything to add quite yet other than to say like, you're so smart.",

So um I'm excited to see that in the last couple of years that there's been um an increasing appreciation in the literature for the importance of measuring redox potential of the microbiome and also the difficulty of measuring this. Um that is uh when um there have been you know studies about redox potential in microbial communities for decades, but there's also a huge body of literature that talks about how hard it is to have reproducibility across experiments. So could you have a redox potential measured in one study, it's probably reasonable to be consistent within a study, but across studies, the numbers that they change by like or like uh orders of magnitude of 10 or 100 um that are um that are dramatic. And one of the things that um I'm interested in if anyone has comments on this is um how can we measure metal ions better in the gut and in real time and this has been a huge challenge in the chemical biology field. Um this is really hard with iron um in in the like in a complex system um where we are is like synchrotron is the only way you can actually measure um iron speciation as far as I know right now um in um biological systems. So it's like doable, but it's not does anybody know how to use one? I don't. I know you can like get time on these, but um it's really complicated. And so it would be um interesting to think about ways to be able to better measure speciation in vivo.",

Um, so even if you measure that there's a difference, say between again like a healthy versus a disease state, what is the impact of that? So you know you have a difference, but is the disease state, say if it's got a reduced level of short chain fatty acids in the circulation, is that still saturation for that that person? Um, and is there a way that we can overcome that? Uh or would the way that we deliver said drug, if it's a short chain fatty acid for example, if we just feed that into the diet versus uh changing the microbiota so that we increase short chain fatty acid capability from the from the microbiota itself, does does that have an effect on the pharmacokinet pharmacodynamics of the drug's stability or access to a different tissue site. Um, and then finally, this conversation about metal ions, there's a lot that sort of was happening while I was trying to get these notes um together, but it sounded like ultimately really there are indications that the microbiota has something to do with uh heavy metal metabolism. There's a lot that we don't understand and technically we don't we don't understand it because there are so many technical challenges just in terms of measurement, reporting across studies and one thing that could really advance the field here would be sensors for metal content and species uh in vivo in real time. And then within that looking for whether or not these heavy metals are acting as electron acceptors or versus enzyme cofactors. How do we feel about this?",

Uh, but usually the concern there is like it's fine for the person, but after they excrete it then where does it go? And that's where the EPA gets in and that's where the concerns uh really are. And also for the ethical dilemma of like, well, you could spread a microbiome from one person to another if you're in the same household and even if person A is sick and is perfectly fine with eating an engineered bug, but you know, their brother or sister or spouse or kid is not and it transfers to them, then they've been unknowingly dosed with a drug.

I know some folks that worked at Synlogic and their clinical trial was giving people a half a liter of bacterial culture at a concentration of like 10 to the 11 CFU per mill.
