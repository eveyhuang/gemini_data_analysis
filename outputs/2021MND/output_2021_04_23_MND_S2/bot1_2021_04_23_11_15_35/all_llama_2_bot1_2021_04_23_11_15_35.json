My lab studies chemistry of the microbiome and I'm really excited by all of the summaries that everyone's giving here. I'm like frantically taking notes of people I want to follow up with. Um just a snippet of what we kind of do in the in the intersection of microbiome and neurobiology. We're looking at the role of gut bacteria in causing alpha synuclein aggregation in the gut. We know that alpha so alpha aggregates are involved Parkinson's disease. Those aggregates um there's a lot of evidence suggesting that they originate in the gut before they um end up in the brain and they get there through the Vegas nerve. We're studying the role of dopamine and iron, specifically iron speciation um in the gut um in order to actually um sort of map how how alpha synuclein happens and which bacteria are involved and what the specific chemical environment is. So I'm excited to talk with all of you more.",

Do we need it to be specific? Um, there's there's so many things that you can think about when you're talking about biological markers. Um but I think that those will become clear as we as we engage in this discussion. And so if questions come up for you, I would say pose them to the group and we'll try and answer them.

We have electrochemical methods and uh colorimetric methods. But that's how we try to do it.

So to me it starts out with clean cohorts of patients. Um perhaps you choose a disease that has a fairly well defined early phenotype that you can detect it early. Um so some of what Elizabeth is doing with Alpha for example. Um and and then once you have that disease specific information, I think then you jump into models and you put those things in in mice or in dishes and try to manipulate from there.

And I think, I mean that's what like the basic science mind thinks about. I mean that's I guess what I used to do in grad school, right? You like break something down and then try to understand it. Now, as a clinician, I think and some of the other um people, I'm sorry, I can't see your names right away, but um we're just talking about, you know, talking from the sort of top like top down. So you take the whole person and what can you detect in the whole person that gives you a biomarker. And I've been thinking about this a lot in autism because I've been doing some neuro imaging work trying to find like a neuro imaging biomarker in autism. I mean first of all, autism is not one thing. I think there's in 10 years we're going to know there's like 15 things we used to call autism and there's genetic autism, there's idiopathic autism, there's blah blah blah, right? But anyways, so you take this top down approach and to me a biomarker is not necessarily one thing, it's a collection of things that's almost like a fingerprint, you know, like the biomarker is a signature that's not that's not one thing you do a lab test for, but you do several tests and the whole profile gives you the biomarker.",

And I I think about this as well just for uh, I mean this is slightly different tangential, but we study H pylori and some of you may know there's a breath test for that, which is based on bacterial urease production which can break down urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide which can be detected using a breath test and I wonder about those as I mean those are again metabolites but small molecule volatiles that can be I don't know in terms of biomarkers I think are really fascinating too.",

Um, what type of receptor they express? Do they somehow have more preference for certain ligand? Again, that ligand might be the product from the micro either protein peptide or metabolite. Um, and then I was looking at the question of our group. Seems like what we we were discussing was a a two-step process. Um, like starting from human patients, that's more like identification of what might be the more relevant biomarker. And then can this knowledge be used to diagnosis or or even treatment. That seems like what uh Star was describing would making uh basically transfer this uh different population of for example fecal samples to the germ free animal and then see whether that actually recapitulate the pathology. And then maybe going back to the to the human uh study to validate or even predict. Um seem seems like this like this like a two two step to to first identify and then um validate and predict.",

It's not idiopathic, so it's a little bit different. So that's why I was curious about, you know, I often sometimes think about how do I delay, you know, preserve the progression of neurodegeneration where I already know what the insult is, not from the microbiome standpoint, but from the genetic standpoint. So, you know, maybe, maybe this, you know, this idea that you're looking at the effect of the microbiome on the aging brain, I guess, could be a way to think about it would give us information beyond just idiopathic disease. This is what I was kind of trying to to tie in. But perhaps maybe it's maybe it's not, I don't know.",

So basically I would say perhaps related to what was the concept we discussed yesterday, right? Like you know, how much oxygen are there. So this oxygen level certainly plays a role for the reducing oxidizing environment. That's like the same for example, like in the environment like for the water if you have this aerobic environment and aerobic environment, you have very different composition of irons. For example, iron 3 plus, right? That happens in oxidizing environment. So so all those matters. I think those eventually comes to the point of um how much oxygen was there, right? I I think one of the conversation I had with one of the mentor yesterday was like, oh, can we measure oxygen down there, right?",
