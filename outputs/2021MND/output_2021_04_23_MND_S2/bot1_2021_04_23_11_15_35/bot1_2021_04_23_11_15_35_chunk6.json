So it's not representative of of your sample. So I mean the trick is just to try your best to work in the same conditions as so if you're like in an anoxic environment, obviously you have to keep your your sample anoxic.",

I do a lot of um not redox speciation but um or get like which which uh compound speciation type work. So I work at different organometallic compounds. Um and we do a lot of work with um enriched isotope spikes. So we would use um um we would add specific isotopically labeled um metals and then look at how they get transformed. And so that's how you differentiate between uh the the ambient, you know, metals which are really hard to like pick apart uh from from, you know, enriched isotopic spikes that you can generally follow um either they're stable or radioactive depending on which which elements you're working with.

So basically I would say perhaps related to what was the concept we discussed yesterday, right? Like you know, how much oxygen are there. So this oxygen level certainly plays a role for the reducing oxidizing environment. That's like the same for example, like in the environment like for the water if you have this aerobic environment and aerobic environment, you have very different composition of irons. For example, iron 3 plus, right? That happens in oxidizing environment. So so all those matters. I think those eventually comes to the point of um how much oxygen was there, right? I I think one of the conversation I had with one of the mentor yesterday was like, oh, can we measure oxygen down there, right?",
