And then clinicians continue to do really beautiful work to understand what is the earliest time point at which you start seeing alpha synuclein. And then if we found out that it's actually in the intestine at least eight years before there's any motor dysfunction. And so what we are doing is saying we have a very precise mechanism that shows how gut bacteria are specifically triggering alpha synuclein at this instance.",

And I think that's the first step. And then I think it allows you to then go back to the humans to say, okay, we found this thing that is an early at least it can push a system in this direction, can you go back to the human population now and say, well was that actually more prevalent in humans in early stages of disease? And then kind of like cut like go back and forth between those two is how how we've been working on that.",

It's not idiopathic, so it's a little bit different. So that's why I was curious about, you know, I often sometimes think about how do I delay, you know, preserve the progression of neurodegeneration where I already know what the insult is, not from the microbiome standpoint, but from the genetic standpoint. So, you know, maybe, maybe this, you know, this idea that you're looking at the effect of the microbiome on the aging brain, I guess, could be a way to think about it would give us information beyond just idiopathic disease. This is what I was kind of trying to to tie in. But perhaps maybe it's maybe it's not, I don't know.",

Um, I'm just going to give us a bit of a time check. We probably have about, you know, five or so minutes left of discussion. I'm wondering actually Amina, do you want to based on maybe anything you wrote down earlier or just your thoughts on how your own work might tie in? Do you want to share anything?",

Um, I guess the way I see this is um I think that I'm interested in is in inputs versus outputs. So when you have a system that function and there are things are produced within the system, we call like kind of like gross rates, right? Things are just happening within the systems and it doesn't really affect the net output. So um you have you have your your microbiome and any other system and you're exposing it to food and environmental conditions and there are things happening within it but that necessarily doesn't affect the outside world.",
