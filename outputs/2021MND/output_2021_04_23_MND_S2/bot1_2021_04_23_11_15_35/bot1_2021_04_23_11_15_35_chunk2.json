Do we need it to be specific? Um, there's there's so many things that you can think about when you're talking about biological markers. Um but I think that those will become clear as we as we engage in this discussion. And so if questions come up for you, I would say pose them to the group and we'll try and answer them.

Uh, I mean, although I missed the previous discussion, so I don't know what you guys have discussed already, but so, so the way we think about it, about it in in in my lab here is we try to find individual signatures or biomarkers, specifically secondary metabolites that are produced by different bacteria from the microbiome and we try to diagno, we try to detect them with different methods. We have electrochemical methods and uh colorimetric methods. But that's how we try to do it. Um, it's not really looking at biomarkers of the whole microbiome, but of specific bacteria that are that are critical within in terms of relative abundance uh with within the whole gut microbiome, skin microbiome and oral microbiome. So that's how we think about it, but yeah.",

So, so I guess it would be more interesting more useful in that context, like ex vivo um context. I don't know how that would work in vivo. I mean, there are ways of there there are ways of engineering uh wearables and pills that you can, you know, you can take orally and then uh they have the biosensors incorporated and and they they can sense as they go through the GI tract um and report on what they're sensing. So that's a possibility. I mean, this technology you can you can connect it via Bluetooth with a cell phone, so that could be one thing that could be attempted, but we have we haven't we haven't gotten to that yet.",

So here, you know, what would be the ideal situation here? So should we also, you know, start from like in vitro then move on to in vivo, right?

So to me it starts out with clean cohorts of patients. Um perhaps you choose a disease that has a fairly well defined early phenotype that you can detect it early. Um so some of what Elizabeth is doing with Alpha for example. Um and and then once you have that disease specific information, I think then you jump into models and you put those things in in mice or in dishes and try to manipulate from there. But as long as the question is directly tying to early stage neurological disease, there's so many caveats with models. I think you have to start with people and then go backwards.

There isn't like usually one single biomarker that kind of like is the grand predictor. Um in like at least in Parkinson's there's a lot of environmental components, which includes the microbiome. Um and uh I I appreciate what you're saying Sarah or um sorry, Aaron about um the yeah, like starting with the like finding a something that we actually see in real life in people, but then also kind of backtracking to simplify the other variables to kind of build up uh like a mechanism and something that I I think I guess a lot about in the um Parkinson's and I guess more broadly neurological disease is that it feels like uh we're just adding more and more of these variables to kind of create a a more complete picture and that there are a large panel probably of biomarkers and um and and we're just kind of like incrementally adding to create a more full picture.

And so you have to in that case, you would have some predefined hypothesis that those molecules would be markers of something as opposed to are you doing a true discovery based analysis where you're trying to find molecules that represent whether it's the microbial infection or the neurological disease. And then I would just propose to take that further, you know, um, and say that you have to consider also the fact of is it derived from the host or the bacterium and how do you address the fact that um many molecules have never been described before. So I think that um signatures matter, I think identity is matter and I think that you have to decipher if you're going after a target or panel molecules or discovering new molecules.",
