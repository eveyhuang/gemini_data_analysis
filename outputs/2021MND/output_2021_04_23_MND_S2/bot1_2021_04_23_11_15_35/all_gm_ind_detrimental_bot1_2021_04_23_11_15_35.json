So the research in my lab we focus on developing nanometer scale uh neurotransmitter sensing probes that can probe the dynamics of neurotransmission with fast response time at the time scale of the occurrence of the neurotransmission. So we also developing uh platforms that can probe different kinds of neurotransmission like chemical transmission as well as electrical transmission. And the third focus is to probe multiple groups of uh small neurotransmitter molecules as well. So for example like in neurodegeneration, it all often like involves more than one kind of neurotransmitter. So yeah, so we are very interested in Alzheimer's disease like neurodegeneration in general. So nice to meet you all.",

So, so I guess it would be more interesting more useful in that context, like ex vivo um context. I don't know how that would work in vivo. I mean, there are ways of there there are ways of engineering uh wearables and pills that you can, you know, you can take orally and then uh they have the biosensors incorporated and and they they can sense as they go through the GI tract um and report on what they're sensing. So that's a possibility. I mean, this technology you can you can connect it via Bluetooth with a cell phone, so that could be one thing that could be attempted, but we have we haven't we haven't gotten to that yet.",

And I think, I mean that's what like the basic science mind thinks about. I mean that's I guess what I used to do in grad school, right? You like break something down and then try to understand it. Now, as a clinician, I think and some of the other um people, I'm sorry, I can't see your names right away, but um we're just talking about, you know, talking from the sort of top like top down. So you take the whole person and what can you detect in the whole person that gives you a biomarker. And I've been thinking about this a lot in autism because I've been doing some neuro imaging work trying to find like a neuro imaging biomarker in autism. I mean first of all, autism is not one thing. I think there's in 10 years we're going to know there's like 15 things we used to call autism and there's genetic autism, there's idiopathic autism, there's blah blah blah, right? But anyways, so you take this top down approach and to me a biomarker is not necessarily one thing, it's a collection of things that's almost like a fingerprint, you know, like the biomarker is a signature that's not that's not one thing you do a lab test for, but you do several tests and the whole profile gives you the biomarker.",

I mean first of all, autism is not one thing. I think there's in 10 years we're going to know there's like 15 things we used to call autism and there's genetic autism, there's idiopathic autism, there's blah blah blah, right? But anyways, so you take this top down approach and to me a biomarker is not necessarily one thing, it's a collection of things that's almost like a fingerprint, you know, like the biomarker is a signature that's not that's not one thing you do a lab test for, but you do several tests and the whole profile gives you the biomarker.'"

And I I think about this as well just for uh, I mean this is slightly different tangential, but we study H pylori and some of you may know there's a breath test for that, which is based on bacterial urease production which can break down urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide which can be detected using a breath test and I wonder about those as I mean those are again metabolites but small molecule volatiles that can be I don't know in terms of biomarkers I think are really fascinating too.",

This pathway might involve both the micro intermediate epithelial cell and neuron. So in that case, maybe we can also start from for example, this epithelial cell. Um, what type of receptor they express? Do they somehow have more preference for certain ligand? Again, that ligand might be the product from the micro either protein peptide or metabolite. Um, and then I was looking at the question of our group. Seems like what we we were discussing was a a two-step process. Um, like starting from human patients, that's more like identification of what might be the more relevant biomarker. And then can this knowledge be used to diagnosis or or even treatment. That seems like what uh Star was describing would making uh basically transfer this uh different population of for example fecal samples to the germ free animal and then see whether that actually recapitulate the pathology. And then maybe going back to the to the human uh study to validate or even predict. Um seem seems like this like this like a two two step to to first identify and then um validate and predict.",

And so that's how you differentiate between uh the the ambient, you know, metals which are really hard to like pick apart uh from from, you know, enriched isotopic spikes that you can generally follow um either they're stable or radioactive depending on which which elements you're working with.

So basically I would say perhaps related to what was the concept we discussed yesterday, right? Like you know, how much oxygen are there. So this oxygen level certainly plays a role for the reducing oxidizing environment. That's like the same for example, like in the environment like for the water if you have this aerobic environment and aerobic environment, you have very different composition of irons. For example, iron 3 plus, right? That happens in oxidizing environment. So so all those matters. I think those eventually comes to the point of um how much oxygen was there, right? I I think one of the conversation I had with one of the mentor yesterday was like, oh, can we measure oxygen down there, right?",
