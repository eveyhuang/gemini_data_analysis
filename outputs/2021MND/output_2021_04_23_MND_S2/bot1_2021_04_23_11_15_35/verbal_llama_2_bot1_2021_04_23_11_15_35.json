So to me it starts out with clean cohorts of patients. Um perhaps you choose a disease that has a fairly well defined early phenotype that you can detect it early. Um so some of what Elizabeth is doing with Alpha for example. Um and and then once you have that disease specific information, I think then you jump into models and you put those things in in mice or in dishes and try to manipulate from there. But as long as the question is directly tying to early stage neurological disease, there's so many caveats with models. I think you have to start with people and then go backwards. Just at least to me that makes more sense. ",

Um and uh I I appreciate what you're saying Sarah or um sorry, Aaron about um the yeah, like starting with the like finding a something that we actually see in real life in people, but then also kind of backtracking to simplify the other variables to kind of build up uh like a mechanism and something that I I think I guess a lot about in the um Parkinson's and I guess more broadly neurological disease is that it feels like uh we're just adding more and more of these variables to kind of create a a more complete picture and that there are a large panel probably of biomarkers and um and and we're just kind of like incrementally adding to create a more full picture.

And so you have to in that case, you would have some predefined hypothesis that those molecules would be markers of something as opposed to are you doing a true discovery based analysis where you're trying to find molecules that represent whether it's the microbial infection or the neurological disease. And then I would just propose to take that further, you know, um, and say that you have to consider also the fact of is it derived from the host or the bacterium and how do you address the fact that um many molecules have never been described before.

And I think, I mean that's what like the basic science mind thinks about. I mean that's I guess what I used to do in grad school, right? You like break something down and then try to understand it. Now, as a clinician, I think and some of the other um people, I'm sorry, I can't see your names right away, but um we're just talking about, you know, talking from the sort of top like top down. So you take the whole person and what can you detect in the whole person that gives you a biomarker. And I've been thinking about this a lot in autism because I've been doing some neuro imaging work trying to find like a neuro imaging biomarker in autism. I mean first of all, autism is not one thing. I think there's in 10 years we're going to know there's like 15 things we used to call autism and there's genetic autism, there's idiopathic autism, there's blah blah blah, right? But anyways, so you take this top down approach and to me a biomarker is not necessarily one thing, it's a collection of things that's almost like a fingerprint, you know, like the biomarker is a signature that's not that's not one thing you do a lab test for, but you do several tests and the whole profile gives you the biomarker.

And so um it's also kind of interesting to think about like the duality of these different metabolites and how they can be beneficial in some context but not in others.

Um, what type of receptor they express? Do they somehow have more preference for certain ligand? Again, that ligand might be the product from the micro either protein peptide or metabolite. Um, and then I was looking at the question of our group. Seems like what we we were discussing was a a two-step process. Um, like starting from human patients, that's more like identification of what might be the more relevant biomarker. And then can this knowledge be used to diagnosis or or even treatment. That seems like what uh Star was describing would making uh basically transfer this uh different population of for example fecal samples to the germ free animal and then see whether that actually recapitulate the pathology. And then maybe going back to the to the human uh study to validate or even predict. Um seem seems like this like this like a two two step to to first identify and then um validate and predict. ",
