I know for Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, they're trafficking, the protein trafficking system has some defects. So I I feel those markers if it's somehow related to neurological disease, which I don't really know. Currently, based on literature, it seems like autism spectrum disorder, the ASD and some depression, even for Parkinson's disease I just heard from Elizabeth. Do we know a spectrum of neurological disease that's definitely have some connection with microbiome?",

The biomarker itself I feel it's a trigger to a downstream a cascade of uh a downstream cascade of response, but that might for example the epithelial cell in the intestine, that may be the intermediate effector of these biomarker from the micro. But then the secondary function from the epithelial cell, it has receptor for both uh the the metabolite and also has the receptor for the neurotransmitter. So this is the one I I would think it's information hub to transfer what is requested from the uh or what is sensed from the microbiome and then propagate that signal to the to the to the neuron to the downstream neuron system through the upstream neuronal pathway.",

            "transcript": "I wonder if I can jump in with a few thoughts. Um I I guess like when I first saw this question, I think I was thinking sort of like what you were talking about just now Kai, like where you think of this kind of like bottom up approach, like where you say like, okay, you have this cell, this microbiome, it you know, whatever, it's excretes something, we can measure that, that gives us a biomarker. And I think, I mean that's what like the basic science mind thinks about. I mean that's I guess what I used to do in grad school, right? You like break something down and then try to understand it. Now, as a clinician, I think and some of the other um people, I'm sorry, I can't see your names right away, but um we're just talking about, you know, talking from the sort of top like top down. So you take the whole person and what can you detect in the whole person that gives you a biomarker. And I've been thinking about this a lot in autism because I've been doing some neuro imaging work trying to find like a neuro imaging biomarker in autism. I mean first of all, autism is not one thing. I think there's in 10 years we're going to know there's like 15 things we used to call autism and there's genetic autism, there's idiopathic autism, there's blah blah blah, right? But anyways, so you take this top down approach and to me a biomarker is not necessarily one thing, it's a collection of things that's almost like a fingerprint, you know, like the biomarker is a signature that's not that's not one thing you do a lab test for, but you do several tests and the whole profile gives you the biomarker.",
