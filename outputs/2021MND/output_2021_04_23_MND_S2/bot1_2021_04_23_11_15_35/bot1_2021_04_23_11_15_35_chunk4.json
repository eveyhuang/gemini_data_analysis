            "transcript": "Well, I think it depends on which disease you want to study. It's so it's not going to necessarily be the same for every disease state. So I think if you're looking for early stage disease, you want to find a disease that has an early phenotype. So if we're going to pick Parkinson's, you might take people who have the sleep disordered um that precedes Parkinson's disease and you can start there and perhaps look at gut metabolites, you know, oral metabolite, pick your pick your specimen of interest that you want to compare that to healthy individuals, uh people without that patholo that uh early sign of neurologic pathology. Um and and go from there but human stuff is great for kind of getting a big picture and getting clues as to what direction to go in. It's very very difficult to do causality until you start going into the mice and dishes.",

Um, I don't know if you guys have heard about these some student of mine did it for a journal club like super smelling humans who can smell like volatiles produced by people with Parkinson's and certain other neuropathologies. Um, and and dogs too have been trained for many of these things. And I I think about this as well just for uh, I mean this is slightly different tangential, but we study H pylori and some of you may know there's a breath test for that, which is based on bacterial urease production which can break down urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide which can be detected using a breath test and I wonder about those as I mean those are again metabolites but small molecule volatiles that can be I don't know in terms of biomarkers I think are really fascinating too.",

Um and in Parkinson's disease they're triggering uh an a neuroinflammatory response in the brain. And so um it's also kind of interesting to think about like the duality of these different metabolites and how they can be beneficial in some context but not in others. And I think that kind of goes back to this idea of this it's it's not we're not looking for one thing usually, but like it's a fingerprint, it's a collection and what do all of these things mean together um rather than than than individually.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I just I just had a thought, you know, echoing what just it is but said, it's typically a a circuit, maybe a circuit or a subset of the pathway. This pathway might involve both the micro intermediate epithelial cell and neuron. So in that case, maybe we can also start from for example, this epithelial cell. Um, what type of receptor they express? Do they somehow have more preference for certain ligand? Again, that ligand might be the product from the micro either protein peptide or metabolite. Um, and then I was looking at the question of our group. Seems like what we we were discussing was a a two-step process. Um, like starting from human patients, that's more like identification of what might be the more relevant biomarker. And then can this knowledge be used to diagnosis or or even treatment. That seems like what uh Star was describing would making uh basically transfer this uh different population of for example fecal samples to the germ free animal and then see whether that actually recapitulate the pathology. And then maybe going back to the to the human uh study to validate or even predict. Um seem seems like this like this like a two two step to to first identify and then um validate and predict.",

Like for for instance release of neurotransmitters from there can also get some information about um some of this process as well.",

Um and so um one of the things that so an example is with Parkinson's. So one of the common models for Parkinson's is overexpression of alpha. I'm sorry I keep coming back to this but it's kind of what grounds me in this conversation. But for that um for that model and I think for other mouse models you're you're accelerating processes that then can also cause inflammation, general stress to a system that I think can modulate what the fingerprint that you're measuring in that system looks like that that has other factors that may not be playing out in a a jungle system where there's like less stress happening.",
