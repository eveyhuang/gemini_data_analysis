Um but uh what you do see is adaptations of bacteria and maybe in non-genetic means so that they are able to resist this phage or that bacteria are using phages as lysogens to compete with other competing bacteria. So I think um the the the role of phages at least in my opinion is super unclear at the moment um and is definitely very different than what you see in freshwater systems or what you would see in kind of in a test tube or or those sorts of things.",

But we loaded uh you know, lambda phages on a swarm of bacteria. This bacteria live in the human oral microbiome and this swarm can transport phages over long distances where the phages do not infect this particular swarm. But then we put an E coli biofilm, you know, next to it and then and this E coli biofilm is inherently protected from phage penetration because it has curly fibers on top of it. But now this swarm can drill holes and can deliver phages and so now this biofilm gets cleared out.",

But then how do we, you know, get a read out for that in from an in vivo setting is something that I don't know. Maybe we can look for phage genomes that are encoded but you know, that's could be one thing or we can just look, you know, do we know what exact number of phages or I think we have a this is a 15 minute warning.

It's speculated that that um protests and other eukaryotic microorganisms that that occur at a lower frequency, they can have an important um effect on diversity of the bacterial ecosystem in overall the microbiome ecosystem because of the their predatory effect that has been really well described in other microbial ecosystems as well. So I think this idea that you're alluding to to go outside of bacteria and go more into the multi kingdom well I guess are not really a kingdom but multi clay approach and trying to study the the true ecology of the microbiome. It is methodologically quite complex though, especially for just the one lab. I would argue would require a lot more collaboration.",

And you may pick that one whether it is would be disease uh focus or age focus or site focus and say let me understand the uh impact of interactions whether is a host micro bacteria virus and then to tease it out to understand the the causal link. That may overcome some of the daunting um uh effect of such a complex uh milieu that you guys have to experimentally tease out. I would agree with that.",
