Then we talked about computational science approaches that can help characterize molecular or metabolic features involved in interspecies interactions between microbes, molecular dynamics. And these approaches can be used to model, predict these interactions. And given that these questions are so new, we should start with small, simple systems aligned with the elemental questions that remain unanswered. And that big data can confound these important initial analysis.",

Um, we also talked about a spatial structure modeling, um, and and what to measure as an output of an ecosystem, the the structure itself of the ecosystem, the interactions or host and or host microbe interactions. This should clearly be measured to understand ecosystem output. Um, most of these interactions are poorly described in part because of the architectural structure is mostly unknown. Geospatial organization studies of these communities would be important. And then we also argue that that measuring this in a quantitative way for the frequency and the strength of these directions can provide real insight on the relevance of of the interactions. We to on on the complexity of the issue here, um, is strain heterogeneity. These issues should consider the vast strain diversity that that occurs in certain microbial species and work at the strain level. And good examples for these would be pseudomonas, bacteroides and bifidobacterium clades.",

What may be an important species when you're young may no longer be when you're not. Um, also important to design tools to resolve spatial resolution of the microbiome and better understand biofilms. How do small molecules diffuse across biofilms? And computational models are a strong reference here to model how these molecules diffuse across different matrices with a gradient of densities as an example. Um, then the argument, somewhat contrarian, but I would argue that not too much, that the drug based effects provide strong evidence that a specific molecule is sufficient for beneficial effects. In this case, perhaps the spatial interaction may not be as relevant. With that said, the discovery of specific drugs following the broad understanding of physiology endocrinology to select drugs and their effects proves that that broad approach is is necessary still.",
