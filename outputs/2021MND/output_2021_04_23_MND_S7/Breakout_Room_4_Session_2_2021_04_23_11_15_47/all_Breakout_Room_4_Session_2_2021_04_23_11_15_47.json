We are interested in the early life microbiome and in fact, we we have a a keen interest in in interspecies interactions early in life. So we like to study the the process by which this very nascent ecosystem goes from it being very simple and being only a few species to becoming a more diverse and and stable ecosystem. And and for that, um interspecies interactions are known to be very determinant as well as of course other environmental factors. And we study this both in in in clinical studies in longitudinal cohort studies using mainly um genomics approaches. But we also like to model some of our observations in in mice, mainly notobiotic mice where we define the collections of microbes and we study them in those systems. We're now starting to do those also in in more um synthetic ex vivo systems using the gut on a chip, although this is something that we just started and I'm looking forward to learning more on. Um, and we're also interested in what happens to the host, especially the immune system. How does the immune system develops in light of the initial changes of the gut microbiome.",

Um and we're also studying the really the specificity, you know, how specific bacteria recognize and interact with, you know, specific parts of the host and how they kind of set up and colonize. So kind of not just the how the physiology of of interactions affects the host, but also how the um kind of the spatial uh colonization um between, you know, the spatial relationships between cells are actually affecting colonization. So if the first thing gets there and that spot's already occupied, um, you know, there's no space for the second one, but maybe the host makes space or maybe the first one makes a space for the second one.",

Um, my training is in biophysics and microbiology. And uh, you know, I have two projects going on in my lab, which I'm more excited about. One is on uh, the factors that shape the spatial structure of a microbial community. And specifically, we are looking at the human oral microbiome and we found that there are certain mortal bacteria that carry other non-mortal bacteria and sort of forms structures that we won't see, you know, fluids flows or motility in the system. Okay. And so we're interested in now what sort of chemical signals are there in those communities. And also we are perturbing certain physical parameters to see how the structure changes. And the other is on uh, the type nine secretion system, which is a secretion system found in bacteria of the phyla bacteroidities and these bacteria secrete secrete adhesion which are present on the cell surface and also lots of enzymes such as you know, gingipain proteases or just carbohydrate degrading enzymes like cellulase and amylase and things like that. And so and etcetera. So we are interested in what is the secretion mechanism and what are the controllers for this secretion and what changes in the secretome effect host physiology.",

        "transcript": "Um, sure. So it's uh bit of, you know, preaching to the choir to to get my very biased view on why I think studying interspecies interactions is important because this is at the core of what we do. Um, my take which I alluded to in in yesterday's um session was that we're studying ecosystems and in general the core of ecology is the study of interspecies interactions because I'm focused in in um early life microbombs, this is um an opportunity to study the the process of succession. What happens when an ecosystem is is birthing and and the steps that follow. And importantly, what happens during those events that characterize in this case primary succession that can perturb that ecosystem. And we understand that ecosystem perturbance is associated with many other pathologies that we write grounds on, right? And and and that's at the core. How does this ecosystem can either prevent um that perturbance or what inherent characteristics in the ecosystem can can prevent um the the reaction to the perturbance can increase resilience to a perturbance. Um and in our case also very importantly, if we can through through very, you know, carefully serving the the succession events and all this initial process, if we can predict what features, whether they're um actual species, whether they're metabolites or genes that can that can um be that can mark the the trajectory of whether the ecosystem is going to set in what we still don't understand but what we perceive as a as a healthy initial ecosystem versus a different one. So I I do think that that studying this is is is critically important uh and that it requires at least from my point of view doing it in a in a simpler than a more complex system and and I think microbiologists have been doing that to some degree for for a number of decades now and there's some systems where where we can try and grow the species that we know now grow in this case in a young baby or in in a disease state um during a perturbance and and study the way they are communicating and how that ecosystem develops. One of the concepts that we're learning from um is and and I'm I'm not an ecologist by training. I just now work with them as I understand how important is their their take on this is the concept of um keystone species or in um ecosystem engineers. Sometimes they can a species can be both or it can be one or the other. But these are species that in the case of the gut microbomb would have really good adaptations to live in that niche and also have the the properties to to to um more efficiently um um communicate with other species and and and and grow this ecosystem into a um a more resilient one and a more functionally diverse ecosystem that as well that we at least at this point hypothesize is associated with health versus not. Um so that would be my initial take on it.",

        "transcript": "Yes, I think computational science is getting there. Uh if you want to understand at the metabolite level, we need to know the molecular structures and the lipid types of a bacterial cell membrane, uh, you know, the the porins that are in the bacterial membrane which have the the selective transport of the metabolites in and out of a cell, you know, what are you feeding a cell, what will be coming out of the cell, all those things are important and computational modeling is getting to the point that we have several species like pseudomonas, uh, pylori and other things, not all of them. Uh, but they are there now. So my lab has developed 10 different bacterial species models right to the molecular level detail. Similarly, on the uh mammalian side, uh, what is the gut epithelial membrane look like? What is the composition of the lipids? Uh, what is the cell cell junctions in the gut, tight junctions and such. Those uh structures are now getting available. So now it's a matter of time to find the experimental collaborator who's looking at those specific questions and which species to put together and what are the metabolites you would like to model. Uh, because there has to be some evidence coming from the experimental groups that these are the two species that do that do coexist or this is the main metabolite that is responsible for the communication and then we can model and give the mechanistic insight or the kinetic aspect of it and those things. So, you know, computational science is only I I just like to say that it's not more than 30 years old when everybody started doing, okay, we have the model. So we are like behind in catching up to the complexity in an experiment, but it's getting there. Um, and I'm happy to say that within uh within maybe next 10 years, we will have, you know, all these data sets available for multi species interactions. But if we start small, given that this question is very new and that's what the log is all about. Uh, I think if we start with that uh basic level that you know, these are maybe say two species of bacteria that are important. Um, and we go down to the atomistic molecular level details of the interactions, I think with a good collaboration, we can start making a difference. And then uh I was speaking to my group yesterday that ultimately it's a big data problem. When you have multiple species with multiple metabolites, uh, and they evolve in time, what we really need to do is have like a map of what are the communication lines between the bacterial species. And that is a big data problem and we need to build that database. We need to uh be able to make that network with somebody was saying that it may be not it's not a linear interaction between two things. There could be many things going back and forth. We need to build that network map and just like, you know, um big data is being used, artificial intelligence is being used to predict that if these are the two species in play, these will be the metabolites. We can get to that point. Uh, it needs to again be built up. So the short answer to your question is yes, but work needs to go on.",

But when we model this, we initially see that when these enter the ecosystem, there's a drastically increased interconnectedness that that can be measured that that is absent with initial pioneers that come even before that. But I would agree with you. If there was a system that would allow to measure the output of what happens with some of these species enter the ecosystem and then to computationally model the the potential molecular structures that that would be involved that that would be really important in my theoretical bias people go, of course.",

And so whether we're talking about kind of cell to cell contacts, interactions versus kind of diffusion based um, you know, uh interactions versus, you know, something uh host host um uh host microbe interactions. And so I I think those those uh it's it it gets quite complicated and and to some extent, I think most of these interactions are poorly described because at least I'm somewhat biased because we don't have a good understanding of of the spatial architecture in these communities. And so for the most part, all of the genomic technology is focused on getting compositional information and so you have very little actual spatial biogeography down at the resolution of microns that really reflect kind of the underlying kind of the the properties and the organization. Um, to to some extent, these are continuous, you know, communities. It's not necessarily like patches. And so the question is, you know, what are the functional associations that exist between this, you know, physically continuous spectrum, um, you know, in in the oral cavity, for example, there's much more layer structure, um, but in the gut, uh at least, you know, it seems like there's potentially more heterogeneity, but it's not, you know, so it's not just like uh, you know, a a a map uh with distinct kind of regions necessarily. Um, and so then many of these interactions might actually be statistical interactions, right? rather than purely, you know, oh A is next to B and so therefore they interact. It's more like, you know, on average A interacts more with B and so having that, you know, uh description built into whatever framework to reconstruct the metabolism, I think is is important. At least that's something we try to start to appreciate more. Uh because I think every time we we think about space, somehow we we see distinct boundaries and that's really not the case in in in in microbial communities. So then like what is the right language to describe that? And also like the frequency of those interactions might be quite important and the frequencies of this those collisions um might be a time varying component of all of this as well.",

Regardless of that, I do think that there are species that are more important than others for the ecosystem and this can be measured.

Uh so I agree with you it's not going to be a single mesh but you can think of them as layers of different densities that are closer to the surface are less dense and as they reach the surface of the bacteria they are more dense and you can look at the horizontal if you will the diffusion versus going through the density layers towards the uh the bacterial surface. So uh again, ECM models are there extracellular matrix that's ECM what I'm referring to. Uh so they exist uh in different densities so people have tried to model even mucin and the gut and say okay there is going to be the bacterial biofilm or bacterial ECM but then there is mucin on the epithelial layer.

That there are many different interactions, hundreds of species, like thousands, tens of thousands of molecules, they change, so could be subclonal species. Um, but if you look at kind of medicine in general, often times they're taking a drug that is very specific, it's inhibiting a specific kinase, it's neutralizing a specific cytokine in a system that's equally as complex as the microbiome, which is the human body, and you can still achieve something in medicine and you know, treat disease, which I guess is the overall goal of what's going on here. Uh so the question is in the microbiome, in order to translate these sort of findings, do we really need to make this comprehensive map either temporarily or dynamically to understand how all these interactions are feeding together or would it be more productive to figure out which one of these interactions are important and instead designing experiments that are trying to find that, you know, there could be a trillion interactions, but there are only these hundred ones that we should really be focusing on in this particular disease state and in these conditions, this is what we should focus to modulate. And maybe in that in that case, you know, the spatial structure doesn't matter. It's really just luminal bacteria that are the really main contributors and there's a single genus of bacteria or even just a single set of bacteria that have these sets of genes that are ones that we should eliminate or ones that we should try to upregulate those genes certain things. Um, so I don't really know how to do that, but kind of this question of how do we pair down and figure out what the important interactions are instead of figuring out what all of the interactions are would be kind of the question that I pose.",

Um but uh what you do see is adaptations of bacteria and maybe in non-genetic means so that they are able to resist this phage or that bacteria are using phages as lysogens to compete with other competing bacteria. So I think um the the the role of phages at least in my opinion is super unclear at the moment um and is definitely very different than what you see in freshwater systems or what you would see in kind of in a test tube or or those sorts of things.",

How do small molecules diffuse across biofilms? And computational models are a strong reference here to model how these molecules diffuse across different matrices with a gradient of densities as an example. Um, then the argument, somewhat contrarian, but I would argue that not too much, that the drug based effects provide strong evidence that a specific molecule is sufficient for beneficial effects. In this case, perhaps the spatial interaction may not be as relevant. With that said, the discovery of specific drugs following the broad understanding of physiology endocrinology to select drugs and their effects proves that that broad approach is is necessary still.",
