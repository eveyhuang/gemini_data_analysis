We are interested in the early life microbiome and in fact, we we have a a keen interest in in interspecies interactions early in life. So we like to study the the process by which this very nascent ecosystem goes from it being very simple and being only a few species to becoming a more diverse and and stable ecosystem. And and for that, um interspecies interactions are known to be very determinant as well as of course other environmental factors. And we study this both in in in clinical studies in longitudinal cohort studies using mainly um genomics approaches. But we also like to model some of our observations in in mice, mainly notobiotic mice where we define the collections of microbes and we study them in those systems. We're now starting to do those also in in more um synthetic ex vivo systems using the gut on a chip, although this is something that we just started and I'm looking forward to learning more on. Um, and we're also interested in what happens to the host, especially the immune system. How does the immune system develops in light of the initial changes of the gut microbiome.",

Um, and so uh one of the kind of key questions that I always come back to is how is the whole different from the sum of the parts? And so we think about um, you know, interspecies interactions uh between bacteria and how they affect the physiology of the host. Um and we're also studying the really the specificity, you know, how specific bacteria recognize and interact with, you know, specific parts of the host and how they kind of set up and colonize. So kind of not just the how the physiology of of interactions affects the host, but also how the um kind of the spatial uh colonization um between, you know, the spatial relationships between cells are actually affecting colonization. So if the first thing gets there and that spot's already occupied, um, you know, there's no space for the second one, but maybe the host makes space or maybe the first one makes a space for the second one.",

One is on uh, the factors that shape the spatial structure of a microbial community. And specifically, we are looking at the human oral microbiome and we found that there are certain mortal bacteria that carry other non-mortal bacteria and sort of forms structures that we won't see, you know, fluids flows or motility in the system. Okay. And so we're interested in now what sort of chemical signals are there in those communities. And also we are perturbing certain physical parameters to see how the structure changes. And the other is on uh, the type nine secretion system, which is a secretion system found in bacteria of the phyla bacteroidities and these bacteria secrete secrete adhesion which are present on the cell surface and also lots of enzymes such as you know, gingipain proteases or just carbohydrate degrading enzymes like cellulase and amylase and things like that. And so and etcetera. So we are interested in what is the secretion mechanism and what are the controllers for this secretion and what changes in the secretome effect host physiology.",

Um, but our lab we mainly um just do the cell culture work and um protein engineering, we collaborate um to test these um tools in mouse models.",
