Just want to throw another one, what is the impact of age you guys think? It uh Claire mentioned for example bifido bacteria as a key stone, but that could be a key stone uh species for uh infant and may not be for the elderly people. How do you experimentally look at those? Uh Harris mentioned the difference in the the mouth and the gut and also small ball and large ball and uh the inter species interaction is just not only between bacteria, you're going to add on viruses and fungi in it as well as those with the host cells as well. How do you guys put all those complex interactions experimentally in and then that would feed to Chica to help you computationally as well. Anyone.",

So to me I I would I would agree. It's overused the concept of keystone species or species engineers. I think there's a series of tests that ecology is like to see associated with these terms and these have not been applied in in the majority. Regardless of that, I do think that there are species that are more important than others for the ecosystem and this can be measured. Um there's a lot of of well there's species that when they enter the ecosystem, they lead to cross feeding events that simply do not occur because they are the ones that with the inherent capacity capacity to to metabolically provide that to other species. But for that one needs to measure the effect of either adding or removing certain species that are suspected to to be important from some of the big data um experiments and and studies that are available and then try to address whether that is true or not in in other systems.",

Um so we do have a kind of um protein you can express in specific spatial region and then it will rip him by a two molecule that to whatever proteins within that region. So that could possibly be used like so you can introduce these um protein to specific like microbiome because um these protein the resolution is like in the hundreds and nanometer no 10 nanometers.

            "transcript": "Abhishek to your question, there are some computational modeling uh efforts that have been made in that direction in which you model the ECM uh so you put in the right uh sort of mesh size if you will, uh the right charges in it and then you look at the molecule that you're trying to see the diffusion of and think of it in different layers or densities. Uh so I agree with you it's not going to be a single mesh but you can think of them as layers of different densities that are closer to the surface are less dense and as they reach the surface of the bacteria they are more dense and you can look at the horizontal if you will the diffusion versus going through the density layers towards the uh the bacterial surface. So uh again, ECM models are there extracellular matrix that's ECM what I'm referring to. Uh so they exist uh in different densities so people have tried to model even mucin and the gut and say okay there is going to be the bacterial biofilm or bacterial ECM but then there is mucin on the epithelial layer. How is that going to? So there is some effort to that.",
