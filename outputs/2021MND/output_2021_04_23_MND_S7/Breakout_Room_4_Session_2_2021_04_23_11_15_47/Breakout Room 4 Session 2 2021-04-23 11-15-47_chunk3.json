Um, as an example, one of the one of these suspected, you know, keystone species that we think are very important in the formation of the early life microbiome are certain bifidobacterial strains, not all of them. But when we model this, we initially see that when these enter the ecosystem, there's a drastically increased interconnectedness that that can be measured that that is absent with initial pioneers that come even before that. But I would agree with you. If there was a system that would allow to measure the output of what happens with some of these species enter the ecosystem and then to computationally model the the potential molecular structures that that would be involved that that would be really important in my theoretical bias people go, of course.",

And so whether we're talking about kind of cell to cell contacts, interactions versus kind of diffusion based um, you know, uh interactions versus, you know, something uh host host um uh host microbe interactions. And so I I think those those uh it's it it gets quite complicated and and to some extent, I think most of these interactions are poorly described because at least I'm somewhat biased because we don't have a good understanding of of the spatial architecture in these communities. And so for the most part, all of the genomic technology is focused on getting compositional information and so you have very little actual spatial biogeography down at the resolution of microns that really reflect kind of the underlying kind of the the properties and the organization. Um, to to some extent, these are continuous, you know, communities. It's not necessarily like patches. And so the question is, you know, what are the functional associations that exist between this, you know, physically continuous spectrum, um, you know, in in the oral cavity, for example, there's much more layer structure, um, but in the gut, uh at least, you know, it seems like there's potentially more heterogeneity, but it's not, you know, so it's not just like uh, you know, a a a map uh with distinct kind of regions necessarily. Um, and so then many of these interactions might actually be statistical interactions, right? rather than purely, you know, oh A is next to B and so therefore they interact. It's more like, you know, on average A interacts more with B and so having that, you know, uh description built into whatever framework to reconstruct the metabolism, I think is is important. At least that's something we try to start to appreciate more. Uh because I think every time we we think about space, somehow we we see distinct boundaries and that's really not the case in in in in microbial communities. So then like what is the right language to describe that? And also like the frequency of those interactions might be quite important and the frequencies of this those collisions um might be a time varying component of all of this as well.",
