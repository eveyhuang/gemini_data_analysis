Um, I think we assume a lot of this is bidirectional, but you know, again, I think as we discussed, we're not really sure, you know, to what degree that there is, you know, directionality from the brain to the gut, right? Or in what context and and what uh, and what are the mediators, right? Um, again, maybe the HPA example is is a good one, but you know, I don't know, maybe you guys know. So what is the what what signals does the Vegas transmit from the brain to the gut? What are the effects or the responses there? I mean, is it like gastric motility? Are there what are the the types of of effects from brain to gut mediated let's say by the Vegas.",

Um, but yeah, I I I wonder if there's more and I, you know, even just the the fact that everyone knows where you know, 90% of the of the directionality is afferent from gut to brain and there's only 10% of the fibers that are brain back to gut. It really makes me wonder if there's more actually diversity in the sensory signals that are going in and actually less communication back um down through that path. Um, either that you don't really need to communicate back to the gut and it's mediating some other non-gut response. Um, or yeah, or maybe the communication in the efferent direction is not through the fibers and it's through immune or molecules instead. So, yeah, I know these are kind of naive thought like very high level thoughts when I I I wonder um about that.",
