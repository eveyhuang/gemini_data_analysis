So um one example is we've done some work on serotonin and so some microbes can make serotonin de novo and then also microbes can stimulate the host to make serotonin. And that could, you know, that gets into the bloodstream and it could either diffuse, you know, and you know, go to other organ systems or it even could act locally on vagal neurons, which all have serotonin receptors. And so I think it's just complicated by the fact that all of these pathways are co-occurring at the same time that you have neuronal acting going on at the same time as diffusion of serotonin and other serotonin related derivatives um and it's kind of difficult to account for the complexity of these happening in tandem.",

So I think it would be really interesting to study whether or not those types of intervention can impact the the gut and and something that's that just came to my mind right now is something like transcranial magnetic stimulation um that's commonly used as treatment for depressive disorders and other um psychiatric illnesses that could be really interesting to see how that changes kind of enteric or or gut functioning.",

So just honing in on NTS and looking at both afferent and efferent um uh signaling using chemogenetics or optogenetics. Um yeah. But um I I mean the most of those studies still really focus on I think um uh feeding behavior, which makes sense given, you know, the the history of literature about the vagus nerve and what I find really interesting, you know, back to this idea of what are the types of messages that are sent is just more and more literature suggesting that the vagus nerve does and um does many more or regulates many more functions than feeding and nausea.",
