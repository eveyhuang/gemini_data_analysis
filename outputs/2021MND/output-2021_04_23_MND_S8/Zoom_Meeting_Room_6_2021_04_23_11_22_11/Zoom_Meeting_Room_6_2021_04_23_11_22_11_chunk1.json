Um, they restore some of the characteristic defects that you see in a germ free animal. So every single one of them has the ability to induce host education, uh immune education, uh homeostasis. So putting them together, like you're just going to hit different parts of whatever immune profile you're you're supposed to be fixing. Um, and then associated with that there's intestinal vascularization, um, and that probably has impacts on gut brain access. So it's a very interesting question of what's right because I don't think anybody knows the answer to that. But each one of them each one of them has a specific niche to fix to sort of educate the immune system and everything that follows downstream of that.",

And so if you have a helminth that causes the bacteria to change their capsules, those will also affect the immune system because the immune system will see something different than things originally.

But if you think about from the modern perspective, we always like to start from a simple model. And also if you think about the technical limitation, what kind of a sequencing technique you want to use so that you can profile the system at each level. So I I think we need to be very pragmatic. So if you only um do 16S RNA uh gene sequence, maybe you're you're only looking to um the bacteria profile. If you do a shotgun genome shotgun sequencing, maybe you you can uh you can look at both um all kinds of uh different uh micro organisms. So I I think it depends on your your model um approach and also your sequencing technique.",
