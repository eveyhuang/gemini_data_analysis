So the research I do is on diet and we can definitely perturb the microbiome with um high fat, high sugar because obviously that's going to change the um microorganisms that are going to feed on that sugar and saturated fat. But I I am fascinated by the fact that we do see differences between males and females and those seem to be pretty consistent within those groups. Um and then there's certainly the impact of um birth and early exposure and how that kind of just sets you up for life with what your microbiome stays as. Um and the last just thought from triggered from these um comments is I do use antibiotics to cause severe dysbiosis and then try to see what's happening in the brain because of that. And um in that case, antibiotics do have a huge impact and we give them in the drinking water for for mice for six weeks, so they're constantly getting antibiotics, but if I think about um, you know, for my kids or something with ear infections and all the antibiotics they've been taking, it's just amazing to think about how static our microbiome can be in general and then those early life exposures to many rounds of antibiotics and how much that can perturb the system in that moment, but I don't know what the lasting impacts are. So I see things like antibiotics having major effects, but um lifestyle factors that seem to be pretty constant don't seem to change that too much and",
