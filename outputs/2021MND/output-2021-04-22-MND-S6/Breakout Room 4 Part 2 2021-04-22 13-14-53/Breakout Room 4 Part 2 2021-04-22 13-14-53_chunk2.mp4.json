And so any I would say any maybe any chemicals we can think about it, any exposure, any chemicals also will, you know, affect the microbiome. So the question is is that is that change sustainable or is it not and in which direction do we want to change the microbiome? I think those are some of the questions that I want to maybe pose or, you know, put a bigger bigger question to to to the group. I think Pam said that she works with metabolites, right? And and so I don't know if you want to add to that Pam.",

So I think a lot of people in the field are now also looking at bacterial metabolism of various amino acids and other other nutrients that we get from our diet. I don't know much about hormonal regulation. That was sort of the motivation behind my question because to me it's a really interesting one and and one that I do think has a role in and and and changing the microbiome during pregnancy at least. I yeah, I don't know much about that area.",

It was a modified fecal transplant. They had antibiotics first and then they had a fecal transplant that they took a dose of microbes for 10 weeks. And we increased diversity of course because we added a lot of new microbes. Uh but there's a few things that we that we that we showed. still a lot that needs to be learned of course. One of them is that the these kids all had gastrointestinal problems and the gastrointestinal problems got better. Most of the kids showed a lot of improvement in behavior too. And the behavior improvements remained. We did a follow up two years later and these kids were their behavior was even better in the in the than when we did the treatment.",

            "transcript": "But importantly, when we finished the treatment, we look at how similar was their microbiota to the donor. And when we finished the treatment, the microbiota of these children was more similar to the donor than to another child. Okay, that kind of makes sense. We had some engraftment. But two years later, diversity was much higher, but they did not look like the donor at all. They had lost that, you know, similarity to the donor. They had now their new microbiota. That some of it some of it probably they just acquire of course from food and from the environment etc. Huge diversity. Diversity is higher, but now the question is like, you know, why and how and how is this, you know, affecting the behavior and if you ask me, we changed the microbiota and we changed the the the microbiota didn't go to the previous state, which was a very dysbiotic one, but I wouldn't say that it was a state a change that remained. Like we we do have this homeostasis in our body that takes it back to a certain state. And so these are some of the questions. I I actually think some of it comes from the biofilm we form when we're infants. Um that sets, you know, sets the sets the the road for future microbiome. I don't know if anyone wants to elaborate comment or has ideas of how we can actually act on it. Um but I was thinking about hormones which going back to Linea because of her comments on human males and females.",

Uh we we this this trial was open label. Everyone was treated. So we know that there was some placebo effect. So what we're doing now is we're doing a trial where we have a placebo arm. Uh we're also tracking the metabolites and we're very interested in looking at changes not just in the microbiome but also in metabolites in feces and in the blood. Of course, you know, yeah, but I don't want to talk about my research. I want to talk about other ideas that you guys might have, other new ideas.",

            "transcript": "I don't know, but I'm really intrigued by, you know, the way the microbiome is formed when you're young. Um whether it's through birth or maybe a traumatic event when you're a child, we know stress changes the microbiome. Um, you know, there've been a lot of studies by um in the Deneden cohort where these children who have stressful events, they have accelerated aging. Um, so something is perturbing the microbiome when they're young and then you sort of need to get stuck there. So I guess the question is how do you change that once you're stuck in this maybe pro inflammatory um, you know, environment to make it healthier. And you know, I'm interested in the idea of exogenously maybe giving different bacteria that, you know, produce a lot of maybe like a butyrate or some other short chain fatty acid or an indole or something like that. But I don't know that we even know enough which ones to do. It's probably going to take a lot of animal studies to do that. Most interested in the idea of a fage to maybe knock out a bacteria that is bad, but again, I don't think we know enough about what's a good microbiome and a bad microbiome. So how do we even start? Is there some like model disease where we can try, you know, we know a lot about the microbiome as a place to start.",

Do you think rodents a coprophagic nocturnal species that is inbred and relatively homogeneous gene we long term fixed diets is a good representation of the human which is not coprophagic at least not on deliberation. It is not nocturnal. He has a very wide range of gene background and we know gene microbe interaction is profound. that has a wide range of diet, wide range of environmental experience that we know affect the microbiota. Do you think that is a good model then are we going to be able to learn from our mouse experiments for intervention? I'm not talking about the basic knowledge of the microbiota. Knowing that for example, there are plenty of papers the effectiveness of probiotics in various disease. Again, I'm as guilty as others that they polluted the literature and those probiotics when it was applied in human has been very, very underwhelming. I just open the question. Do you think that we are wasting our time looking at the animal models or what? Dave, you are very quiet. Let's start with the Dave and I want to hear everyone else.",
