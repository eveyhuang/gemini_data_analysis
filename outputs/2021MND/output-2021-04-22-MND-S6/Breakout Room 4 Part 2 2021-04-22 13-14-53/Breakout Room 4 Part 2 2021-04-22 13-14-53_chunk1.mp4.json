            "transcript": "That is such a good question. I would love to know like for personal interest as well. Um so I'm not going to completely answer this question, maybe somebody else can. Um just as a preface, I have like tangents in my mind, but something that I see in the mouse world um because I do breed mice and then see what's going on there. Um and I'm really interested in these different time periods because since I am seeing sex differences in the microbiome, I'm really interested to know how it changes like through puberty, um reproductive time and then um like specific to females and then menopause because I think there's definitely a hormonal influence and maybe someone else can be more of an expert and speak to that better than I can. Um a complete other added random thing that I'm interested in is like the flip side. I usually look at how does the diet affect the brain with neuroinflammation, but then on the other side, something I did in my postdoc and I'm hoping to get back to is um food seeking and palatable food seeking and um why we crave certain foods and why we go after them. And I definitely think that there is a um obviously an evolutionary component to that where we seek out pleasurable foods because they're high in fat, they're high in sugar and from a female reproductive, this is how it all connects. Um perspective there, you know, you have to put on that weight to carry the baby and to lactate and I definitely think there's a microbiome component obviously to driving up to the brain um to seek out palatable foods can, you know, consume enough fat and sugar to maintain a healthy pregnancy and to maintain enough fat supply within lactation. So super roundabout way of me saying I don't really have an answer for you, but it's something that I'm interested in to know how does the microbiome change during pregnancy and lactating post pregnancy that would drive um food seeking to support you know, especially with a mouse, they're going to have like eight, 10 pups in a litter. They've got to work really hard to keep up um enough calories to take care of those pups for 21, 28 days. Does anyone else have better information than I have other than just more questions?",

Sorry, that's my dog that needs wants to come in. Um and especially in the third trimester and in general, most of these changes um are what in other studies could be associated what some people may call a dysbiotic um microbiome.

Is it through molecules? Is it through secreted proteins? Um and I feel like we're at least us, we're in the business of building tools. Um but we need to know what sort of nails we need to hit in order to move forward. So I think that's the the the big sort of major question is how how can we really get at that?

There are macrophages and monocytes that enter the brain, but microglia play the main role in terms of um surveying and responding to foreign invaders.",
