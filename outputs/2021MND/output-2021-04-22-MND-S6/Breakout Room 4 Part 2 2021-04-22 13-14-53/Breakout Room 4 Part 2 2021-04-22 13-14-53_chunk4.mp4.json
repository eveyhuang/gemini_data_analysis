I think that's just my my two cents on on some of these topics, but um and then how you relate that to humans, that's a that's obviously there's a big gap there. So uh I mean Nandita was mentioning the continuum between test tubes, um, you know, mice and then humans. And I think there are huge gaps there that we don't really understand. Not only in the context of the microbiome, but any any disease really and and again, can we can we build predictive methods for being able to to correlate it better the data that we get in mice versus humans and how do we do that? And then how do we take into account individual differences amongst different people in terms of in our case, you know, microbial composition and I don't know, it opens up a lot of questions and I I don't think we have a lot of answers, but I think it's just good to discuss some of these things to to to to at least try to come up with tangible hypotheses that we can that we can investigate.",

Microorganisms will change the environment around them, but they will also react to their environment. So it is important that the environment is changed so you can have a sustained, you know, change too. And so the provocative question is the environment is the host and so we need to also understand better how the host is communicating with these microbes. Um and how do we how do we maybe change that interaction, right? So I'm just I don't know if anyone has ideas.",

Um so what what are some methods that the host is modulating modulating the biome. Um so what kind of micro environments can we change in the host in order to uh in secondarily they're affect the biome then. Uh so one way of interest that I've been looking into is these uh small RNAs that are coming from hosts that are modulating the gut microbiota. Uh this is oftentimes occurring through uh exosomes being released from the epithelium. So this is something that we're very interested in uh as one of these alternatives to uh what we all commonly see in the literature pre or probiotics. Uh but using these types of small RNAs which can be manipulated and generated in the lab uh as a way to to get at this question of modulating uh the biome.",

I so I am not uh a worm biologist, but I've heard quite a bit about C Elegans as model organisms for the gut brain access and um, you know, kind of thinking about um Caesar's reductionist um ideas as a place to start. Um, it seems like, you know, C Elegans would be a really easily controllable system to start narrowing down um, you know, perhaps individual or or um small interactions among, you know, populations of a few bacteria. Um and and being able to sort of modulate that. Um the the other thing I was thinking about was actually more about the um kind of approaches or um I don't know, uh treatments that that could happen and I I wonder if if also looking to the cancer literature would be beneficial. Um I I know that there have been a number of cancer study or studies um sort of in in um like oncology fields about how chemotherapies, for example, affect patients microbiota over the course of, you know, X period of time and um, you know, we know that they don't actually completely obliterate them. Um they they do definitely damage and change them. Um but there are longitudinal studies and I I kind of wonder if looking also to the chemotherapeuic realm or even um non chemo but um radiation as a as a possible different type of um application that could could be changing the biome.",
