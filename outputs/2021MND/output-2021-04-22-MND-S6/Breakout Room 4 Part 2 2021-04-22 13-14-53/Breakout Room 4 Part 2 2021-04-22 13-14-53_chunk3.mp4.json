I know that in the cardiovascular field, there's been some studies that have now started using field mice even to overcome some of the issues that you brought up, whether they be due to inbreeding or some of the other hurdles we can't overcome in in lab animals. And there it's been shown that some of these same probiotics that work in inbred hypertension models don't have the same effects that they do in these field mice. So yeah, I think that the the the question is great and we need to figure out just how translatable some of these are, but evidence recently suggest that maybe some of them are not going to cross over.",

The the modulation of the microbiome would be what they would refer it as as um restoration of ecosystems or restoration biology.

We study both humans and um, mouse, mice, where I think the the where we want to go, but we're not there yet at least is to try to model these ecosystems in in advanced in vitro systems that can that can hold at least simplified microbiomes, whether they are in in gut organoids or in on organoids on a chip, in a system that would allow mimic the the true microbes that that reside in in the human and then study them within the framework of ecology and if we want to change it within the framework of of restoration ecology.",

The question was, is it a good model for testing means to modulate microbiota for better health? And I'm not saying that it is not, but I'm saying that one has to put everything together on that aspect of it. Just want to go back to restoration because is a very important point and that would eliminate the issue of bad bacteria, good bacteria or dysbiotic or eubiotic, which we don't know. is restoring the community to the state that was not associated with the pathology. And in fact, the analogy that was mentioned is restoring the habitat in the in the oceans, to bring the algae back and so on is a very good analogy. Um just want you guys think and expand on it.

So looking at consortia experiments at least through a reductionist lens in the laboratory, looking at growth, how how each bacterium influences each other's growth. Um and then start to perturb them, those those communities in some way and there are a number of things that you can do added, you know, through addition of um of new microbes, uh you can do subtractive approaches, you can delete microbes from the community using you know, antibiotics if you want broad spectrum or if you want some more selective selective targeting, you can think of engineering peptides or engineering pages. Uh and then, you know, I think I think probably important to start uh from that reductionist approach. Obvious obviously not ideal, right? But um, but if, you know, we got to start from somewhere and I think if we start maybe with three microbes, four microbes, five microbes and try to understand how they influence each other then you can you can begin to extrapolate those that understanding to higher order uh microbial communities. so I think I mean I I think it's a very exciting uh time for the field. I think but I think it's important to move from all the correlational observations that we've seen of how different microbes correlate with wide range of diseases and try to develop technologies that allow us to start establishing causal effects. Um And so I think in order to do that you probably have to again grow take that very reductionist approach. start growing bacteria in the lab uh under artificial conditions, which I agree, you know, it's not ideal. Uh but to try to try to start to to to start understanding them. And that's how we've always worked with bacteria, right? with pathogens traditionally that's how we gain a lot of the the knowledge that we have today is through through those um those sort of experiments.",
