And the blood brain barrier is made up of claudin 5, which is belongs to the family of claudins, but that is unique to the brain. So if you are looking for transport across that, we have studied the extracellular interactions between those claudin molecules and found out the pore sizes and the chemical specificity of the pore to figure out whether a cation, for example, is going to go easy or the anion. Even at the it's very iron selective and size selective. So those are the interactions we are looking at. But if you go to the gut and try to study the same tight junction interaction, that is made up of claudin 23 and claudin 11 and 3, which is very different from the brain. So what can go through the gut epithelial layer is different than what can go in the brain. So if the metabolites are going through, they have to be able to navigate that difference in the tight junctions. And that is just the paracellular aspect of it. The receptors and other things is a completely different story and which metabolite prefer going through the receptor needs to be known in my mind to to understand this this axis.",
