            "transcript": "So uh we have uh so we study the molecular interactions at the tight junction level which is caused by the proteins called claudins and the blood brain barrier is made up of claudin five which is belongs to the family of claudins uh but that is unique to the brain. So if you are looking for transport across that uh we have studied it uh the extracellular interactions between those claudin molecules and found out the pore sizes and the chemical specificity of the pore to figure out whether a cation for example is going to go easy or the anion even at the it's very ion selective and size selective. So those are the interactions we're looking at. But if you go to the gut and try to study the same tight junction interaction, that is made up of claudin 23 and claudin um 11 and three, which is very different from the brain. So what can go through the gut uh epithelial layer is different than what can go in the brain. So if the metabolites are going through, they have to be a be able to navigate that difference in the tight junctions. And that is just the paracellular aspect of it. The receptors and other things is a completely different story and which metabolites prefer going through the receptor uh needs to be known in my mind to to understand this this axis.",

Um and it seems like there's been, you know, some recent studies on like, you know, looking at traumatic brain injury and and its effects on the microbiome and it seems like there's some inflammatory responses but I I'm not I this is not my area so I'm I'm curious whether people have any thoughts as to what what are the mechanisms associated with this? Is it through the the vagal nerves um in a bidirectional fashion? And also there's been some past studies on looking at, you know, peripheral nerve stimulation for immune modulation and and I don't think anyone's I'm not aware of any studies looking at how that might affect like, you know, the microbiome and and so I I wonder are are, you know, if people have any thoughts about that.",

But what is interesting is the microbiome then doesn't change until so that slowing happens really early two to four days and then microbiome composition doesn't shift until two weeks later significantly um and then really solidified like four four weeks later.",
