And so we've been doing sort of um qualitative research on what people do with those data and then how that might change their behavior and like say their diet and is it more motivation to like eat better that not to improve your own health but to improve the health of your microbiome.

Um, because then that's a way that you can get a signal passing um directly from a metabolite, not not just a not just a neuron, right? But it could be from a microbe itself. Um, getting signals shuttled up that way. Um, it's a far out idea um that we came up with a long time ago um when I was a postdoc actually that we're trying, been trying for four years now and it seems to be real. Um, there's a group that has a paper that looks at um mitochondria from from from monocytes that do that and we're looking at like ribosomes. Um, that do that as well so that you can actually get like proteins from your immune cells inside of inside of a neuron, which is one of the reasons why we think that it's when you look at inflammation um comparing like um neurons to immune cells, you see similar signatures of inflammatory mediators, but in fact the it's not the same because it's the inflammatory mediators are actually coming from um immune cells and not from the neurons themselves. And so it's a really huge um undertaking that we're doing as a young lab, but it's super fruitful and interesting and so we're talking about far out ideas, that's one. I definitely think one.",

Where uh you know, you basically you you go into some induced, you know, um brain state but also uh I I don't think it's well described like what happens to these hibernated animals in their microbiota and they're, you know, I guess they're they still have some bowel movements. Um, I guess you could there's you know, animal models where you can, you know, artificially induce hibernation and I wonder if that could be an interesting um way to think about that as well.",
