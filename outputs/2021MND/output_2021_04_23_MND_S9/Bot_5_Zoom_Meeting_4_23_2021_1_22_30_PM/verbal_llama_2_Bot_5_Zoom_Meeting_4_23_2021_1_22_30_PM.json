So if the metabolites are going through, they have to be a be able to navigate that difference in the tight junctions. And that is just the paracellular aspect of it.

        "utterance": "Tim Sampson: So, I've took a bunch of notes in the notepad section, so down at the bottom here. So hopefully there's a lot of everybody's thoughts represented. Um, and sort of distilled these these bigger points. And so in thinking about what the what are the main routes of communication between the gut and the brain. And so I feel like we we sort of delved into the two the two halves of this, the humoral side, the circulation and versus the neuronal and how do we study and differentiate between those paths. And so on the humoral side, thinking about metabolites coming from the gut that can cross the blood brain barrier or via the circumventricular organs. Um, but which factors are those um, whether they're microbes themselves or metabolites, circulating cytokines and how do we actually identify those metabolites. Um, and they could be any like oh should probably change this order, but things such as, you know, exosomes, uh small RNAs, things coming variety of different metabolites coming from from both bacteria or or potentially the host. Um, using methods such as isotopic labeling perhaps. Um, how do we differentiate between protein activity versus small molecule activity. And so really kind of focusing on those methods there. And then also really the the idea that uh which I found interesting uh that tight junction disruption in the gut isn't necessarily going to be the same as tight junction disruption in in the brain. And so just because certain metabolites are getting out doesn't out of the gut doesn't mean that those are going to be the ones that can cross the brain. Um, and then on the neuronal side, I feel like we we mostly focused on the top down aspects of of how CNS to either peripheral nervous system and enteric nervous system or to the microbiome might be affecting microbiome composition. And so I I put this phrase here that anything that alters anything in the CNS that alters motility might have an effect on microbiome composition and I think that's true. Um, you can disagree with me. Um, but then is motility actually the primary thing that changes. And so while that might be the the largest driving factor, there's also these many other effects that um the CNS uh has has impact on to towards the ENS. Um, and then can we use disruptions in those top down systems in order to probe uh those interactions that are happening in the gut. So uh we talked about pain and anxiety and peripheral nerve injury to look at how you know, CNS to to peripheral nervous system signals could change uh microbiome composition. Uh, and then I guess towards the end, uh we were talking a lot about those particular tools and it seems like one of the biggest gaps, which I'm kind of surprised it sounds exists is this fact that we haven't yet leveraged all of those great tools for the CNS to look at ENS interactions. Um, so using the the very specific um adnoviral vectors and and these different optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches that have been well established and validated in in CNS systems just that that it seems to be a gap in in the enteric nervous system itself. And so using those tools to guide or or to to learn more about those interactions. And then towards the end here in my last 60 seconds, uh you know, how given the number of bacterial species, how do we how do we actually define which bacteria we want to look at. And do we limit to just metabolites? And so if there's anything I'm missing, please please holler. Or edit this yourself. ",
