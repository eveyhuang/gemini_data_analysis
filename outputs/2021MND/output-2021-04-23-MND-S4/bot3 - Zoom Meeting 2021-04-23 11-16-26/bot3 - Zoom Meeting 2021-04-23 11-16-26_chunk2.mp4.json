            "transcript": "Zoom into this. Microbes also evolved to use many of those same signals for communication purposes or competition or whatever. Microbes invented all of the neurotransmitters, right? That's actually how it worked. It's not that they're neurotransmitters and the microbes figured out how to make them. The microbes invented dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine. It's because they're simple biotransformations of amino acids, simple modifications of amino acids and thus they're evolutionarily very, very useful. And so, I guess, to me, the bigger challenge that the system faces to your point actually that you were talking about say for using epinephrine or norepinephrine to regulate lymphoid structures is the fact that when you go to the gut, you have all these microbes basically screaming at you all the time with these. And if you choose then to use those signals to build those systems, the microbes are more an interloper than anything else. And so I think, I guess to start on kind of the last question, to me, one of the challenges of the organizations of the structures is to have compartmentalization in a way where you don't have signals from, you know, the metaorganism side of things that you don't have control over genomically, evolutionarily, messing with your own evolution of of tissue structures or cellular communication within the host. But this is my anyway, this is my biased point of view. I'll stop because I've thought a lot about certain aspects of this. I don't know Sarkis if you have thoughts if that's consistent with your thinking.",

We can think about the source, right? of cytokines and neurotransmitters, right? immune cells, neurons, or bacteria, right? And then the cells that are receiving those signals, right? And think about ways of of you know, understanding and I think this is more towards the last bullet point here, but understanding what those you know, relationships are both in a spatial level and in a functional level, right? So we know cells by their mammalian or bacteria make these things and then other cells respond, right? So I think understanding that there's a lot of you know, dots that haven't been connected, but I think the basic understanding is there, right? But I think just understanding in terms of how the all these cell types are are interacting with each other, let's say in the gut would be I think really really interesting project, right?",

They're both capable of producing the same thing, but is there evidence that they compensate for each other? I know Melanie, you're a brain person. Do you think that if you take out microglia that the neurons will compensate and produce like a bunch of cytokines?",

They certainly can supplement or support, but um, I don't know how I feel about committing to interchangeable. Um, I think as Sarkis mentioned, they you know, they're capable of doing it, but do they do it? In what conditions do they do it? So I think we have a lot of um gaps still in knowledge before we can really identify that.",
