Because you know, I think it it it helps focus at least thinking, you know, and um you know, the types of experiments that one would do, right? You know, you know, because the epithelial cells and neurons at least, you know, in those context synapse, immune cells and and neurons synapse, neurons and neurons synapse. And so just understanding the communication when cells are together seems like a more tangible approach than trying to understand what all these cells are doing, you know, not just distally but but you know, in terms of long distances, right? That that that you know, for example, if one were to study a cytokine that's made in the gut and may may actually signal to the brain in a soluble fashion. I think those types of experiments are just much more challenging than reducing it to understanding interactions that happen at synapses.",

Um, so I'm not sure how how much of that dynamic has been solved.",

But I don't know that that the assumption that these these specialized endocrine cells actually sluff off in the same way um as as, you know, enterocytes it may not be true, right? Of course things like intraepithelial lymphocytes do this flossing where they basically like keep moving down the escalator as the escalator of epithelial cells goes up, they actually move down to to maintain a longer lifespan. And so I think it's just not known, but it's a really good point because it to me it would make sense that this should be a longer term connection. This shouldn't be something that then every two days you're having to rebuild.",

My understanding was particularly in infection models, if you have hyperplasia or rapid growth to replace the cells, they they they're undifferentiated so you don't have as many EC cells. And so my understanding was that they develop as they go up the villus axis and so they differentiate and so but once they're differentiated, I'm not sure if it's known or what the physiology is of them whether they reintegrate themselves.",
