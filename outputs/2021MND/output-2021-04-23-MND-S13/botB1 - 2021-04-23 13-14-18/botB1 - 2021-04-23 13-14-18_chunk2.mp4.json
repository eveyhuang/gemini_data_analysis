It's like really uh tightly coupled way to control how the information is transmitted. Um, but I think about like a microbial community, I don't I mean like I don't know where that synapse is to even get the bacteria signal there was a serotonin part on here. Like how does the bacterial signal get",

Um, so I think that the field is is taking more of a reductionist approach because it's easier to wrap your head around, you know, what one metabolite might do or what one family of metabolites might do. But I think that we really should be thinking systemically. I think you're getting at the question of there's as somebody alluded to earlier thousands of metabolites and they all if they all have activities, what is the summation of all their activities? And so I think that's probably more likely that what's going on in vivo, um, although, you know, I think that we're as a field just coming toward that um that question.

Um, you can stimulate the um kind of the internal endocrine cells to actually make and in turn they make, you know, different types of hormones um that affect other the activities of different tissues.

I don't have a good sense of um how dopamine is or is not able to stimulate dopaminergic neurons themselves to then actually influence that um like the transmission of dopamine in the synapse uh as a neurotransmitter. I don't know if anyone has um perspective on that, but I think there is a a uh in a few different context, some from Emily's lab of of dopamine being produced through bacteria um uh from levadopa, which is the drug, but also a metabolite in vivo.
