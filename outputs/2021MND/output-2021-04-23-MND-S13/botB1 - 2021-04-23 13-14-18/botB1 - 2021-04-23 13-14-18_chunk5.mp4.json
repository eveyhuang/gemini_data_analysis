Uh you use magnesium, but if you spoof in manganese, you screw up the polymerase and it gets error prone, right? Can if you substitute or or or put in like some cobalt or something, uh you know, in the in the microbiome, I wonder how that would change I'm not saying we don't dose people with heavy metals, right?
