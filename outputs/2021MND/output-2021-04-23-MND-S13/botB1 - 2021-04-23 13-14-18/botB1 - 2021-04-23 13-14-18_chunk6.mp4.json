Um, so even if you measure that there's a difference, say between again like a healthy versus a disease state, what is the impact of that? So you know you have a difference, but is the disease state, say if it's got a reduced level of short chain fatty acids in the circulation, is that still saturation for that that person? Um, and is there a way that we can overcome that? Uh or would the way that we deliver said drug, if it's a short chain fatty acid for example, if we just feed that into the diet versus uh changing the microbiota so that we increase short chain fatty acid capability from the from the microbiota itself, does does that have an effect on the pharmacokinet pharmacodynamics of the drug's stability or access to a different tissue site. Um, and then finally, this conversation about metal ions, there's a lot that sort of was happening while I was trying to get these notes um together, but it sounded like ultimately really there are indications that the microbiota has something to do with uh heavy metal metabolism. There's a lot that we don't understand and technically we don't we don't understand it because there are so many technical challenges just in terms of measurement, reporting across studies and one thing that could really advance the field here would be sensors for metal content and species uh in vivo in real time. And then within that looking for whether or not these heavy metals are acting as electron acceptors or versus enzyme cofactors. How do we feel about this?",

Uh but the two examples that were in PKU PKU where there's accumulation of fetal fetal alanine and as well as in hyper anemia, kind of the idea of engineering bugs to scavenge those since they are circulated through the gut. Um, and it's kind of very indirect. They are um associated with neurological diseases. Um, but they're not necessarily associated with the microbiome, but it's at least another thought of maybe we don't even need to understand really what's going on and really just use the microbiome as an agent through which we could engineer the metabolome of the host.

I I thought his idea was great, but I worry about regulatory regulatory issues uh with genetically engineered microbes. Um, and I I worry strongly about that because I have I have worked in the bioremediation field for more than 20 years and if we're not allowed to inject a microbe in the soil that is genetically engineered, um, it kind of steers my mind to think that we would be allowed to do that in a human, you know, so I don't know any any thoughts on that.",

            "transcript": "I mean, I've had a couple conversations with some folks at the FDA and it actually seems like the FDA is much more risk tolerant than the EPA. So I think the um, I think the thing is if someone's sick and they're going to die, uh there's a lot more tolerance for trying to save them in whatever way possible, even if that means introducing an engineered bug. Um, and for most of these engineered bugs, there are a number of either kill switches or oxytrophies that are put in to make sure that they won't get released. Uh, but usually the concern there is like it's fine for the person, but after they excrete it then where does it go? And that's where the EPA gets in and that's where the concerns uh really are. And also for the ethical dilemma of like, well, you could spread a microbiome from one person to another if you're in the same household and even if person A is sick and is perfectly fine with eating an engineered bug, but you know, their brother or sister or spouse or kid is not and it transfers to them, then they've been unknowingly dosed with a drug. So there's definitely some ethical um issue there, but regardless it seems like, you know, they're trying to grapple with the the ethics both on the environmental and the medical side of that and it's all moving forward uh at least from my opinion. It's not something it's something that should be figured out and not something that should be necessarily a bar to the field in general.",
