And how does it get into the serum if so? And I don't know, you know, you know, there's direct activation of ENS. This is outside of my purview, right? But how would something get to the the brain by the blood brain barrier? I guess. So you have to get in the blood first.",

Uh so there's in the 70s and 80s before we were concerned about C14 carbon. There's some beautiful studies that show like the tracking of, you know, like pharmacokinetics of drugs, um which we leverage a lot um uh in our lab like going back uh to use those. When you think about the molecules that are produced endogenously, it does get really tricky to me to think about, well, even if it's getting produced, where does it go from there? Is it going between cells? Like is it across the epithelium? Is it going through a cell, which could matter in terms of um we think a lot about oxidation state. If it goes through a cell, this could change like oxidation state as opposed to between cell. And uh this is something we've struggled with in the lab, like thinking about how do you actually track those specific molecules that are getting produced where it's more obvious if it's an exogenous source that you're providing, like a carbon, we can use C13 labels too, but how do you do that in vivo um and follow where it goes? And I don't I I I love if someone could answer that or like ideas for how people think about that.",

I think it connects with what you were just saying too and this is so outside of my area, something I want to listen and get information because I have a lot to learn here, but um in terms of crossing the blood brain barrier, that might not be a major like it's certainly a question, but we don't know if there's um small molecules that are traveling that need to get past the blood brain barrier or if for example, we're talking about serotonin activation that's happening in the gut that could then um stimulate the vagus nerve and that would then send a signal to the brain and then you know, we might not have to get past the blood brain barrier based on who knows if it's a neurotransmitter like dopamine or serotonin produced in the gut. Again, I have way more questions than any answers, but we don't even know which route or both or which one matters or so it could be vagus nerve, it could be humoral, I don't know. But if someone has an answer to Elizabeth question, jump in now.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, yeah, one of the techniques that uh or that I I know Michael Fishbach has done a lot of it, but is this idea of using sort of defined microbial communities and then doing genetics within the microbes there. So at least there you can envision that if you know microbe A is responsible for the production of this molecule and you can tune that production in a germ free model and then down the line look at that phenotype, you you might depending on whether or not it's it's also made by the host, you could conceivably track like, okay, the bugs in the gut, it's making this molecule, it's, you know, it's in the serum, it's in the lamina propria. Oh, it doesn't make it into the blood brain, so it's not directly acting in those sort of contexts. And I think those models are are pretty powerful, um although, you know, scaling it to hundreds of molecules and you know, hundreds of different permutations of uh microbial communities makes that a little bit challenging.",

Um, my plan is to use precision medicine approaches to approach neurodevelopmental conditions to try to understand them better, but my PhD work was in the neuroscience of the gut, which has sort of brought me back around to this question of um, you know, sort of microbiome and neurodevelopmental conditions. I have to be honest with you, for most other sessions, I've felt I've been able to follow and it's probably because I came a little late, but um, sort of the level of the scientific discussion has been a bit above me, which is in part why I haven't jumped in yet. So it's been part of what I've really enjoyed about this dialogue is that I truly have learned so much and like my day-to-day, I think looks very different from a lot of you, so, um, I don't have anything to add quite yet other than to say like, you're so smart.",

Um, yeah, I'm I'm a developmental Pete's fellow, um, who's just offered an assistant professor position at the University of Calgary. So I'm sort of like in the very, very early stages. Um, my plan is to use precision medicine approaches to approach neurodevelopmental conditions to try to understand them better, but my PhD work was in the neuroscience of the gut, which has sort of brought me back around to this question of um, you know, sort of microbiome and neurodevelopmental conditions. I have to be honest with you, for most other sessions, I've felt I've been able to follow and it's probably because I came a little late, but um, sort of the level of the scientific discussion has been a bit above me, which is in part why I haven't jumped in yet. So it's been part of what I've really enjoyed about this dialogue is that I truly have learned so much and like my day-to-day, I think looks very different from a lot of you, so, um, I don't have anything to add quite yet other than to say like, you're so smart.",

That would be uh very unusual, but like, you know, the same a similar composition might give you totally different phenotypes in a in two hosts, right? And so like maybe there are metabolomic ways of uh of doing precision medicine that that where key metabolites are measured and you can say, okay, well, you know, if this person has a lot of build up of X, you know, it means that means something about metabolism of whatever drug of the of the line. Is is that a thing? Um, or are people really focusing on genetics and micro, you know, the first and second genome, let's say as the um",
