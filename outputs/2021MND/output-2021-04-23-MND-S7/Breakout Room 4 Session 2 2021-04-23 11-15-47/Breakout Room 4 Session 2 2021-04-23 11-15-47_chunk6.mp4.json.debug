Yeah, I mean in our experience, we found that phages are um they're unsuspecting players in modulating uh microbiome physiology that you know, the the standard paradigm is that they're these very lytic agents that could selectively remove strains.
But we've found in the dense environments of the gut that that's very that's very rarely seen that um rather you see very common coexistence between obligately lytic phage and completely susceptible bacteria without any evolution of resistance on the bacterial side.
Um but uh what you do see is adaptations of bacteria and maybe in non genetic means so that they are able to resist this phage or that bacteria are using phages as lysogens to compete with other competing bacteria.
So I think um the the the role of phages at least in my opinion is super unclear at the moment.
Um and is definitely very different than what you see in freshwater systems or what you would see in kind of in a test tube or or those sorts of things.",

But we loaded uh you know, lambda phages on a swarm of bacteria.
This bacteria, capnocytophaga live in the human oral microbiome.
And this swarm can transport phages over long distances where the phages do not infect this particular swarm.
But then we put an E coli biofilm, you know, next to it and then and this E coli biofilm is inherently protected from phage penetration because it has curly fibers on top of it.
But now this swarm can drill holes and can deliver phages and so now this biofilm gets cleared out.",

But then how do we, you know, get a read out for that in from an in vivo setting is something that I don't know.
Maybe we can look for phage genomes that are encoded but you know, that's could be one thing or we can just look, you know, do we know what exact number of phages or I think we have a this is a 15 minute warning.
So now we have 15 minutes.",

Uh and what do I mean with the uh the context?
There are observational human studies that just look at the associations.
And you may pick that one whether it is would be disease uh focus or age focus or site focus and say let me understand the uh impact of interactions whether is a host micro bacteria virus and then to tease it out to understand the the causal link.

And one of the way to overcome that, you put that relevant functional biological relevance of interaction in the context. And therefore by doing that, you make it less complex. Uh and what do I mean with the uh the context? There are observational human studies that just look at the associations. And you may pick that one whether it is would be disease uh focus or age focus or site focus and say let me understand the uh impact of interactions whether is a host micro bacteria virus and then to tease it out to understand the the causal link. That may overcome some of the daunting um uh effect of such a complex uh milieu that you guys have to experimentally tease out.", "speaking duration": 75, "nods_others": 0, "smile_self": 0, "smile_other": 0, "distracted_others": 0, "hand_gesture": "None", "interuption": "No", "overlap": "No", "screenshare": "Yes", "screenshare_content": "Marie-Claire Arrieta shared a word document.
