            "transcript": "Um, sure. So it's uh bit of, you know, preaching to the choir to to get my very biased view on why I think studying interspecies interactions is important because this is at the core of what we do. Um, my take which I alluded to in in yesterday's um session was that we're studying ecosystems and in general the core of ecology is the study of interspecies interactions because I'm focused in in um early life microbombs, this is um an opportunity to study the the process of succession. What happens when an ecosystem is is birthing and and the steps that follow. And importantly, what happens during those events that characterize in this case primary succession that can perturb that ecosystem. And we understand that ecosystem perturbance is associated with many other pathologies that we write grounds on, right? And and and that's at the core. How does this ecosystem can either prevent um that perturbance or what inherent characteristics in the ecosystem can can prevent um the the reaction to the perturbance can increase resilience to a perturbance. Um and in our case also very importantly, if we can through through very, you know, carefully serving the the succession events and all this initial process, if we can predict what features, whether they're um actual species, whether they're metabolites or genes that can that can um be that can mark the the trajectory of whether the ecosystem is going to set in what we still don't understand but what we perceive as a as a healthy initial ecosystem versus a different one. So I I do think that that studying this is is is critically important uh and that it requires at least from my point of view doing it in a in a simpler than a more complex system and and I think microbiologists have been doing that to some degree for for a number of decades now and there's some systems where where we can try and grow the species that we know now grow in this case in a young baby or in in a disease state um during a perturbance and and study the way they are communicating and how that ecosystem develops. One of the concepts that we're learning from um is and and I'm I'm not an ecologist by training. I just now work with them as I understand how important is their their take on this is the concept of um keystone species or in um ecosystem engineers. Sometimes they can a species can be both or it can be one or the other. But these are species that in the case of the gut microbomb would have really good adaptations to live in that niche and also have the the properties to to to um more efficiently um um communicate with other species and and and and grow this ecosystem into a um a more resilient one and a more functionally diverse ecosystem that as well that we at least at this point hypothesize is associated with health versus not. Um so that would be my initial take on it.",

            "transcript": "Yes, I think computational science is getting there. Uh if you want to understand at the metabolite level, we need to know the molecular structures and the lipid types of a bacterial cell membrane, uh, you know, the the porins that are in the bacterial membrane which have the the selective transport of the metabolites in and out of a cell, you know, what are you feeding a cell, what will be coming out of the cell, all those things are important and computational modeling is getting to the point that we have several species like pseudomonas, uh, pylori and other things, not all of them. Uh, but they are there now. So my lab has developed 10 different bacterial species models right to the molecular level detail. Similarly, on the uh mammalian side, uh, what is the gut epithelial membrane look like? What is the composition of the lipids? Uh, what is the cell cell junctions in the gut, tight junctions and such. Those uh structures are now getting available. So now it's a matter of time to find the experimental collaborator who's looking at those specific questions and which species to put together and what are the metabolites you would like to model. Uh, because there has to be some evidence coming from the experimental groups that these are the two species that do that do coexist or this is the main metabolite that is responsible for the communication and then we can model and give the mechanistic insight or the kinetic aspect of it and those things. So, you know, computational science is only I I just like to say that it's not more than 30 years old when everybody started doing, okay, we have the model. So we are like behind in catching up to the complexity in an experiment, but it's getting there. Um, and I'm happy to say that within uh within maybe next 10 years, we will have, you know, all these data sets available for multi species interactions. But if we start small, given that this question is very new and that's what the log is all about. Uh, I think if we start with that uh basic level that you know, these are maybe say two species of bacteria that are important. Um, and we go down to the atomistic molecular level details of the interactions, I think with a good collaboration, we can start making a difference. And then uh I was speaking to my group yesterday that ultimately it's a big data problem. When you have multiple species with multiple metabolites, uh, and they evolve in time, what we really need to do is have like a map of what are the communication lines between the bacterial species. And that is a big data problem and we need to build that database. We need to uh be able to make that network with somebody was saying that it may be not it's not a linear interaction between two things. There could be many things going back and forth. We need to build that network map and just like, you know, um big data is being used, artificial intelligence is being used to predict that if these are the two species in play, these will be the metabolites. We can get to that point. Uh, it needs to again be built up. So the short answer to your question is yes, but work needs to go on.",
