I think those approximations need to be made if you're getting, you know, one big number, this is two times more viscous and therefore the diffusion is this many times less. You you need those kind of big numbers to jump at you. But if you are trying to distinguish between water and alcohol molecule, ethanol and water, then those measurements don't work. So, as a chemist, I have a respect for water and I respect ethanol for who they are and what they are, and I don't put them in the same bag. So, so yes, the the high headline number is important. Like, you know, you want to know if I am talking about this metabolite, what's its diffusion rate versus the other. But it is really the chemical structure that started the difference in the first place. So I respect that difference.",

That there are many different interactions, hundreds of species, like thousands, tens of thousands of molecules, they change, so could be subclonal species. Um, but if you look at kind of medicine in general, often times they're taking a drug that is very specific, it's inhibiting a specific kinase, it's neutralizing a specific cytokine in a system that's equally as complex as the microbiome, which is the human body, and you can still achieve something in medicine and you know, treat disease, which I guess is the overall goal of what's going on here. Uh so the question is in the microbiome, in order to translate these sort of findings, do we really need to make this comprehensive map either temporarily or dynamically to understand how all these interactions are feeding together or would it be more productive to figure out which one of these interactions are important and instead designing experiments that are trying to find that, you know, there could be a trillion interactions, but there are only these hundred ones that we should really be focusing on in this particular disease state and in these conditions, this is what we should focus to modulate. And maybe in that in that case, you know, the spatial structure doesn't matter. It's really just luminal bacteria that are the really main contributors and there's a single genus of bacteria or even just a single set of bacteria that have these sets of genes that are ones that we should eliminate or ones that we should try to upregulate those genes certain things. Um, so I don't really know how to do that, but kind of this question of how do we pair down and figure out what the important interactions are instead of figuring out what all of the interactions are would be kind of the question that I pose.",

Uh, we may not need trillions of interactions that could be going on. But then the opposite end was the keystone uh metabolite, right? That those are the two things. You are advocating in the sense that identify the keystone metabolites, uh, maybe not one, but many, but a hundred or a thousand. But which are those? So keystone could be one or two, but what I'm saying is that there could be a collection of important molecules or metabolites that you want to do. So in yesterday's presentation, uh, we heard that uh small molecules, um, short chain fatty acids were the the important ones and their influence was very important in the uh in the age of the microbiome.",

I think of microbiome if you for a moment give indulge is like, you know, the ecosystem on the earth. Right? We we live on different continents, we have different uh you know, countries have different foods that they grow and crops that they grow and so on. We consume different things.",

So, if you're looking at the evolution and seeing how the snow caps are melting, uh, we have narrowed down the keystone problem. The keystone is get the carbon emissions down. No matter what we we synthesize on earth and you know, local um local environments are different. We have very cold places and very hot places. So if you take that analogy down to the gut now and you say, okay, there are all these species living in the gut in doing different things and you know, so many metabolites are crossing, all that is happening on earth as well, we produce all these exhausts from the companies, but ultimately we've identified which is the main main few gases that we need to uh tap into and stop. I don't know, my analogy might have gone too far, but that's how I want to think about things.",

That the drug based approaches or or or the core pharmacology, that historically also involved a very exploratory survey of the physiological systems in the body and understanding endocrinology and biochemistry to try and select the right molecules to hit and then experiment in a more reductionist way if it would be effective. I think that we're just, you know, fast forwarding decades when we look at microbiome biochemistry and we know very little of it. I think that there's needs to be a more exploratory approach. I would argue that this is the phase where we're in. Um, and that that will hopefully select some candidates, it may not be just one, two or three, maybe a few of them that can lead to this more um drug based or or or drug um or pharmacology align approaches that that would follow.",
