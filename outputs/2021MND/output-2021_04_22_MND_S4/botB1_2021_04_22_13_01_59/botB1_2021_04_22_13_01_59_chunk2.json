At the same time, they can look at the bile acids that are produced by the metabolic activity and they can measure the metabolic activity and the bacterial cells, their motion and their adhesion and their propagation in in in situ without needing to disrupt nice cell of and also via inter interhepatic regulation. So I don't know, maybe that helps. So in a non-destructive way, they can actually look at that. You know, lipids that could be produced by liver and then in turn fed to the microbiome. Who knows what happens to those um",

Um, you know, as you know, you know, usually we think about the brain and microglia as intrinsic, you know, macrophage of the brain, but we also know that peripheral macrophages, uh, and T cells are also able to cross the BBB.
