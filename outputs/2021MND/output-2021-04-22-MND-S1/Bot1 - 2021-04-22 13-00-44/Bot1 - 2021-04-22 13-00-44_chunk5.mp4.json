So I'm wondering whether some value could be derived from thinking about it more from a network perspective instead of a list of things perspective one and two whether tracking uh the development in in in individuals uh over time uh to kind of map out the space of configurations uh that form that ecosystem uh and understand how external perturbations perhaps modulate it because ultimately it seems the complexity is so big it might make sense to to understand the the constraints uh and I'm just thinking if we compare across individuals or you know groups of one type versus another uh we'll we'll we'll never have enough statistical power to understand what's going on and if we should shift back almost like to individual cases and see how things develop there. But um that is a complete outsider's perspective so tear it apart in the hope it leads to something better.",

So if you were able to capture the metabolites at the young stage and then progressively watch them change uh in the network that you said uh that will be a very important information and I think that also refers to what Erin was saying that you know her research is on multiple sclerosis and she would like to go upstream and say uh what why did this disease happen and I'm able to detect the disease once it is uh too late but how did we arrive here uh that is a longitudinal study and I think uh that will we we will not have the statistics if we start with a naive experiment and grow the the complexity but maybe longitudinal is the way to go in those cases disease models.",
