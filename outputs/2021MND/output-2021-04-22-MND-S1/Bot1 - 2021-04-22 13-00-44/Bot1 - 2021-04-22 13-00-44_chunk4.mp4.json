I think we report out, or sorry, I'm I'm looking at central time, but basically 15 minutes before we have to report out, we'll like talk together and decide what we want to say. So don't feel like it's all on you.",

            "transcript": "I would appreciate that. Um, I guess the thing, the thing that I keep coming back to and I think always comes up in these types of conversations is, so for the things that we know about, for the metabolites we know about, like glutamate, short chain fatty acids, right, we have ways to detect those already. What I'm particularly interested in is like what other metabolites, what other small molecules are important that we're missing because they end up in that like, you know, if you've seen a metabolomics data set, like half of it is unknown, one unknown to unknown 300. And those can be, you know, the most significant ones based on whatever analysis you're running, but if it's an unknown, you're kind of stuck. The same is true for hypothetical genes in in a metagenomics data set. Um, the techniques are are getting better to get annotation and to ascribe um particular genes to a particular organism, but I'm still not sure how you can pick that out of the complex community De novo. So what I keep wrestling with is is there a way to use some kind of maybe big data approach to identify those unknowns that are really important that you can then maybe use some computational spectra analysis machine learning to try to predict what that metabolite might be. Um that's all out of my realm of expertise, but the unknown problem is really tricky.",

So you have, as Amina was saying, you have the local effects on the bacterial community itself and how that interacts with the host. Then you have effects on, let's just say, epithelial and epithelial cells that are like neighboring cells. But then you also have what can be potentially be important effects on immune cells which circulate and affect the rest of the body. You could potentially have effects on nerve endings with neurotransmitters that are in the enteric nervous system and have impact on this. So in order to really ask the question of how can we identify these novel or biologically important, you know, I think you have to think about like where are we measuring our outcome on on what.",

            "transcript": "So that gave me an idea, you know, the discussion that is going on. So suppose, I'm just going to hypothetically come up with an experiment. Uh, suppose we have mice which have no uh microbiota in it, like proper showing initially. And then we say, okay, can we uh uh in uh plant specific microbiota of say one or two species that we know, you know, particular species that we know. And then we go and uh identify the metabolites both at the level of uh what's in the in the blood, uh the immunological responses. Again, I I'm not an experimentalist, I will not use the right terms. Uh, but what I was trying to say is that we sort of uh fingerprint uh all the chemicals that we need at various stages or in various uh nerve endings, whatever have you. I don't know how much that is feasible, but what then we can do is a correlation that introduction of these particular two species, one species, whatever bacteria resulted in these metabolites. And then we can progressively uh increase the complexity of the microbiota that's introduced and see how the metabolite uh big data grows.",

That can also be useful if we have this kind of thing, we can also then use it for disease models like Aaron was mentioning that uh if you recognize this metabolite uh that means it is coming from this particular bacterial species because we've seen it over and over again in different. So it's a hypothetically big uh you know, wild idea, but I think we need to grow that database of uh which bacterial species is responsible for uh a particular metabolite and then the interdependence because I'm sure one uh one kind of bacterial species affects the other.",

So again, going back to that hypothetical experiment, you have a mouse with no bacteria in the beginning and then you introduce one, then in not just looking at the other metabolites, you also want to see if any other species colonize just because of the diet or the environment the mice is in and uh check for that.
