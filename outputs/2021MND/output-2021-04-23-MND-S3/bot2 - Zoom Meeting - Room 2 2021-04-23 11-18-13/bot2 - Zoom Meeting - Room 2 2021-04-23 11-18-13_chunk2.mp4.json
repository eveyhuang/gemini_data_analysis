I understand you guys are right. One of our problems is we get a lot of changes that we see. But identifying those bacteria that are responsible for the changes is is a different task. And let's couch this in terms of uh neuroinflammation. How do you guys go about uh identifying the group or small group or individual bacteria uh that are good or bad.",

And again, at least with Parkinson's disease, there's a a plethora now of of samples. So on the order of thousands, I think now that have been sequenced pretty deeply. So we can see not just associations and the presence or absence of particular microbes, but actually enrichments and correlations with different aspects of disease severity, uh things like the constipation phenotypes that happen in in these patient populations. Um, things like severity of the motor symptoms, uh rapid we don't quite have progression yet. Um, you know PD is is a pretty long disorder that takes a long time to progress. So to my knowledge, we don't have that sort of temporal resolution, but we do have sort of that um cross-sectional uh resolution of of disease severity.",
