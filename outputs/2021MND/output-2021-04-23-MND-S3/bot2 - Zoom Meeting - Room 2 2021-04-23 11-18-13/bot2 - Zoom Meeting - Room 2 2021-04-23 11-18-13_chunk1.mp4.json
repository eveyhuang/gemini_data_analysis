And uh, you know, it's it's cast a whole new light on the developmental process and I'm someone who believes that the developmental process sets the organism up for the kinds of things that are going to happen later, such as the kinds of things that that uh Bob has talked about. And so we're uh in my lab also interested in interactions between the microbiome and other tissues, um uh and the nervous system. So in the gut, we look a lot at immune cells in the gut and in the brain, we look at microglia, which are the resident immune cells in the brain. I don't know the best way for people to introduce themselves because we probably all have uh each other in different places on our screens.",

Uh my lab studies mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease uh like Alzheimer, Parkinson and Huntington disease. We try to understand the molecular basis of mitochondrial quality control uh in this across of neurodegeneration in neuronal cells and glial cells. And we also develop therapeutics targeting mitochondria. Uh we use uh the all kinds of therapeutic approach to targeting mitochondria to uh to see if this is a uh the useful target for uh preventing the course of neurodegeneration. Uh recently we started to look at the the role of mitochondria in the uh gut and the brain access, especially in the context of Alzheimer disease and the Parkinson disease. We try to understand uh we want to test the hypothesis that if mitochondria in the gut system could actually serve as like Asian bacteria and they communicate with the immune system which actually released the factors and uh the message to the brain and and also trigger which trigger the neuroinflammation in brain. Uh this is our hypothesis. We also started to look build up the model system to work on this uh big questions. Yeah.",

Um, and we are focused on understanding how microbial metabolites are being sensed by the host and what are the downstream consequences of such sensing. Um, so we are trying to identify the function of unknown metabolites and and on the host side we are trying to identify new receptors that can sense these metabolites and we use different tools like germ free mice and different transgenic models to to knock out these receptors or potential receptors that we have identified to understand these these communications better.",

I'm interested in trying to understand um that kind of mechanistic pathway that explains how oral disease, particularly periodontal disease is linked to extra oral conditions. I look at that in maternal populations, so the association between um periodontal disease and pre-term birth and I've also looked at it in older adults, um association between periodontal disease again and um mild cognitive impairment and um have begun looking at it in a population of vapors um to see what the impact of e-cigarette use is on oral health and then the oral microbiome. I'm particularly interested in the oral microbiome and associated inflammatory pathways.",
