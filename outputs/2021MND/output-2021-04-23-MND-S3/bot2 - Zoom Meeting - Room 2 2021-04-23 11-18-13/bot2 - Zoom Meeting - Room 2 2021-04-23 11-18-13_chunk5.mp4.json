So there's no there's no evidence to my knowledge of gut bacteria being viable and trafficking via these anatomical pathways to the brain. But I do think there's some experimental data at least from the oral or nasal microbiome showing that bacteria that are present at those epithelial surfaces uh can traffic across the the barrier and into the the brain and can actually be viable and live there. So it's not coming from the gut. Um but it's another microbiome surface uh that that can directly at least shows as an example that that bacteria can can do this. Okay.",

So that's kind of a cool thought that it it is possible but you know, no one's ever shown it. So I think that's also a really cool idea potentially um for for a a grant idea that's kind of far out there. But anyways, um the other yeah, so I was actually talking about this yesterday uh with a couple people that if you because we've done this taking out different um um sensory neuron populations and done some some sequencing and we see um depending on the disease state or pathological state that your sensory neurons can look like, you know, neurons or they can have signatures that look like immune cells and have upregulation of a of a wide variety of different receptors that are typically um uh immune and in nature. We call it like topic immune expression.",

And I just want to tell you about an experiment we did unpublished. We took a a genetic hypertensive model and and a control. And we gavaged a a fluorescently labeled E coli that's antibiotic resistant into the parents to be of these mice. And we let them grow up for 15 weeks and we could find this E coli uh throughout the body including the brain. So it definitely in my opinion gets there.",

We've just taken the brain out, chopped it up and put it on media. But we've also taken the brain out and and sectioned it. Okay? And then poured media on top of the brain sections. And we could see bacteria growing in the brain as well. Now that there's potential for contamination there, I I must say. I I think the where we chopped the brain up and and plated. I I think that's that's pretty good.",
