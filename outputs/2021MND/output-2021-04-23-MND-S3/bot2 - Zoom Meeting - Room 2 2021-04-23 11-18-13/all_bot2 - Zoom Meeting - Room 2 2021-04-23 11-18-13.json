And again, at least with Parkinson's disease, there's a plethora now of of samples, so on the order of thousands, I think now that have been sequenced pretty deeply. So we can see not just associations and presence or absence of particular microbes, but actually enrichments and correlations with different aspects of disease severity, things like the constipation phenotypes that happen in these patient populations. Um, things like severity of the motor symptoms, rapid we don't quite have progression yet in PD is a pretty long disorder that takes a long time to progress. So to my knowledge, we don't have that sort of temporal resolution, but we do have sort of that cross-sectional resolution of of disease severity. And so I think that is that's been the first kind of low-hanging fruit that that we can then test experimentally in some of these animal models. So for instance, asking if those microbes that are enriched in patients that have the worst symptoms, do they induce the worst or a significant amount of inflammation or pathology in the brains of gnotobiotic mice? So I think that's at least the way that my lab approaches that conundrum. And it really is just these association studies, which again for PD are are pretty powerful, but for other disorders, maybe not as much.",
