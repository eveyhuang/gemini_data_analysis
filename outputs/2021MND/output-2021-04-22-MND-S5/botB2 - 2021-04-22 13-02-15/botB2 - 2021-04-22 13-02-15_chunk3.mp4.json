Um so so that way we have well accomplished two things. One is it's uh it it greatly reduced the testing burden so that just you know, we have a panel of say 90 90 in this case small molecules. Uh but the second the second part of is we know what these molecules are. Uh so obviously short chain fatty acids, um bio acids among many other things and then also give us concentration as a as opposed to um just some spectral value.",

Um and each of them um pertain to specific peaks in the mass spectra. Only about 10 only about a thousand of those are annotated. And definitely when we do when we run the statistics, it's like, okay, like there is a lot majority of the peaks that are found to be significant in in the context of a particular, you know, case control study are unannotated. I mean, we know these are, you know, some of them may be junk or like, you know, adducts and stuff, but um these are like really important stuff and no one knows how to annotate them and as Stephanie was mentioning to, like it takes a long time.

Um, and also uh, you know, the the hunger hormones from the gut uh like leptin and grelin. You know, those are kind of uh, you know, produced in the gut as well, but also can be stimulated for production by the gut microbiome. So kind of like not how not the how the gut microbiome directly, you know, makes chemicals to impact the brain, but also it affects the uh those these hormone secreting cells in in the epithelium of our gut to make um, you know, these hormones like uh you know, grelin leptin um serotonin dopamine to affect kind of behavioral, you know, neural behavior and decision making.",
