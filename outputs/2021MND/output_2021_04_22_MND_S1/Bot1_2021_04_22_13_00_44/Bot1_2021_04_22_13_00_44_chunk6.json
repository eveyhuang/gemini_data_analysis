It's really, you know, patient control comparisons and then leveraging useful reference databases, you know, reference libraries to figure out what those metabolites are.

And so we know we know I think I would go for something like that, right? Where we have a perturbation that we know has a clear measurable effect in the microbiome because I think all the probiotics and the nutritional that part this is just so hard to find a a real signal in the microbiome. That's at least my surface level understanding of the matter.
