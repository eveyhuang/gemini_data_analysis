Uh, so given that the short chain fatty acids we talk we heard Bob tell us about and also the serotonins and the hormones that we just are talking about, we can study how they enter the epithelial cells or how they are secreted uh across and how they transport across the membranes or through the epithelial layers which will contribute to the communication part of this question. Uh, how does the communication happen? But is are the molecules small enough or the metabolites small enough to just penetrate through the cell membrane versus the receptors. And question is that, you know, if you knock off the receptors, does the communication still happen? So identifying part of it is not my expertise, but if given the data that these are the metabolites that are found, uh, we can talk about the communication part of it because there is enough uh details available now about the epithilia of the gut uh and also the bacterial membrane itself and the bacterial porins that really transport the metabolite in and out of the material cell also. So sort of you know the walls of the two uh, you know, the the epithelial cells and the bacterial cells and the the if you know the metabolites then the communication piece of it, how that is happening can be model at a molecular level at the atomistic level. And that can provide a lot of information. The other piece that is now growing that if we have a body of data that given these are the microbial species in a in the gut and the associated metabolites, there is uh this whole uh new computational tool of big data where we can start putting together that, you know, what is the correlation between having a list of bacteria and having the metabolites and what is that correlation?

And those can be, you know, the most significant ones based on whatever analysis you're running, but if it's an unknown, you're kind of stuck. The same is true for hypothetical genes in in a metagenomics data set. Um, the techniques are are getting better to get annotation and to ascribe um particular genes to a particular organism, but I'm still not sure how you can pick that out of the complex community De novo. So what I keep wrestling with is is there a way to use some kind of maybe big data approach to identify those unknowns that are really important that you can then maybe use some computational spectra analysis machine learning to try to predict what that metabolite might be.
