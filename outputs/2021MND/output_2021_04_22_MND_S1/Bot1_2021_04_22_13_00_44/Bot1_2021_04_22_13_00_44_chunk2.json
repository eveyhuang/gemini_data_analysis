So I cannot comment much on how to identify these species, perhaps folks with the expertise more on microbiome, metabolomics and things like that, they can help us. But in terms of I was thinking like does the gut micro microbiome basically if it is if it modifies or metabolizes some of those neuroendocrine signals.",

And so definitely it would be something that we we can develop multiplex diagnostics that they can probe each one of these individual factors, like they can probe the level of those neurochemicals for example, or hormones and at the same time they can look at the metabolic activity and they can measure the metabolic activity of the bacteria cells, their motion and their adhesion and their propagation in in in in situ without needing to disrupt, you know, lyse the cell or takes the I don't know, nucleic acids or RNA out. So in a non-destructive way we can actually look at that. So yeah, these are some of my thoughts.",

So we can monitor the level of that um metabolite externally and whatever the cell is producing, uh depending what it is, we can make a sensor, have if it is released if if it is permeable. That's the question. But if they are, if their amount is changed in the environment, in the extracellular solution, uh because of these interactions, we can monitor them. We can monitor the level of those neurochemicals, so",

We can also monitor um we can build sensors that they can monitor the permeation of let's say uh uh BBB, the blood brain blood barrier.

So um like both malian and bacteria cells, uh we can integrate our sensors with those um what the question would be what are we targeting exactly? Uh in terms of small molecules, we know some of them. Um, like one example was the you know, the short fatty acid uh short chain fatty acids. Uh, there are also others that, you know, studies show the norepinephrin, epinephrin, serotonin, dopamine, um, they can actually uh in in Parkinson disease patients, I think I was reading. and again I apologize, I'm not the expert in that thing. I'm I'm more like a technology an engineer to build diagnostics. I was reading that all of these um hormones and neurotransmitters, they are studies that they can actually they can uh pass and they can get to the gut and they uh can affect how cells are behaving. Um the virulence factors go up, uh they grow more um and vice versa. What cells produce, like let's say again, these uh short um fatty acids is one of them. How they affect the brain stuff uh brain uh related mechanisms.",

            "transcript": "So, I'd like to talk about sort of taking a computational approach to all the things that have been discussed. Uh, so given that the short chain fatty acids we talk we heard Bob tell us about and also the serotonins and the hormones that we just are talking about, we can study how they enter the epithelial cells or how they are secreted uh across and how they transport across the membranes or through the epithelial layers which will contribute to the communication part of this question. Uh, how does the communication happen? But is are the molecules small enough or the metabolites small enough to just penetrate through the cell membrane versus the receptors. And question is that, you know, if you knock off the receptors, does the communication still happen? So identifying part of it is not my expertise, but if given the data that these are the metabolites that are found, uh, we can talk about the communication part of it because there is enough uh details available now about the epithilia of the gut uh and also the bacterial membrane itself and the bacterial porins that really transport the metabolite in and out of the material cell also. So sort of you know the walls of the two uh, you know, the the epithelial cells and the bacterial cells and the the if you know the metabolites then the communication piece of it, how that is happening can be model at a molecular level at the atomistic level. And that can provide a lot of information. The other piece that is now growing that if we have a body of data that given these are the microbial species in a in the gut and the associated metabolites, there is uh this whole uh new computational tool of big data where we can start putting together that, you know, what is the correlation between having a list of bacteria and having the metabolites and what is that correlation? Uh, and just to sort of to give you an example like, you know, when we buy stuff on Amazon,",
