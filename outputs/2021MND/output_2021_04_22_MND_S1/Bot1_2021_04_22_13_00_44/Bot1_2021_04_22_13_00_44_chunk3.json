That is also machine learning artificial intelligence where you are putting two things together, you're putting trends together. And I think having enough data on the species and the metabolites can start help us build that big data point of view and say, whenever this specie occurs, uh, this is the result or this is the metabolite that's in the system. And so the patterns that we cannot see, uh, because we are looking at one molecule or a group of molecules, those patterns will emerge if we have a lot of information on this. So I think the answer to the diversity of the microbes in the gut, uh, could be solved from the big data analogy in uh, in the, you know, commercial world of uh, selling products.",

Um, and and is very difficult because the populations used for the research were so heterogeneous or because there wasn't enough information. And I I agree with you, um, about the potential for big data and machine learning. I think that has tremendous potential, but just would say that part of the what we would want to I think feed into those models would be enough clinical information to kind of um, have downstream measures. I don't know how helpful that is, that's that's my bias.",

And I see what you're saying, you know, in if you are talking about personalized medicine, you need to know a particular patient's uh in detailed uh, you have you have to have detailed information to say, okay, this is what we need to cure this disease. Uh, and so yes, maybe the bottleneck is getting that big data right now because the tools of artificial intelligence are getting developed in other fields, not uh microbiota, but they will become available once we have the data that we need. So, uh, the I think in this question identifying uh the species is the bottleneck right now. I think there might be solutions past that bottleneck.",

            "transcript": "you know, it's uh you you mentioned uh in other fields. Uh, for example, so we work a lot on material engineering and uh like a lot of nano materials. So I know I personally don't work on energy for catalysis, but I know for example, uh there are a lot of computational works starting from the first principle calculations and then uh coupling them with AI uh to really screen a bunch of different transition metal dicalcogenides and chalcogenides to uh see how they interact with hydrogen or oxygen, very simple um molecules to um for energy, for hydrogen evolution reaction or you know, basically for catalysis, you know, catalyzing those reactions. And there has been a lot of uh discoveries actually that way. Um, like um again, I I like in terms of like super conductivity, that's also the same. They were actually started with computational works that they predicted that this is going to be like with this given like just a specific angle. Like if you have two graphene sheets, if you rotate them by 1.1 degree, for example, you are going to get super conductivity. It started with theory, but then people try to do that because you know, think about it. How many different angles can we really try? And we are talking about 1.1 degree. It's it was so specific and actually then people could do it. They just focus on it, finally people one group could get it and it worked. Uh so it seems to be in some sense similar. Meaning we have really the see ocean of different things that could be of um, you know, could be the biomarkers and the only way that could work is machine, AI, which can tell us what are potential biomarkers. And perhaps AI and all these big genomics omics data, they can narrow down. Maybe they are doing it. I'm not the expert in that field. So maybe there is already there, so um, so we we know uh some uh you know, we have some answers, but I I'm not in that field, so I don't know. Is there someone who knows that, you know, how much progress",
