So whatever that design is, then we have to have some path to be able to at least that is um one of what one of the things that we discussed is in real time monitor level of those small molecules or those biomarkers in real time without the need to kill them or slice the tissue things like that which is really totally different. Of course those approaches are needed as a standard to compare with. But if we want to see in real time what is going on then those sensors can be integrated or embedded in that in vitro or in vivo model. Of course it needs to make sure for being more complex but there are in my opinion that's what I think you have to have access to all those genomics metabolomics all the omics.",
