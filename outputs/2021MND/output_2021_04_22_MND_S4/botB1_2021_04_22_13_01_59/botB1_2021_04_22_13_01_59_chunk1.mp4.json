So we are interested in understanding how you know both genetic environmental influences so for example in the gut microbiome and how different gut microbial compositions and gut dysbiosis can very much shape and alter what we used to think were quantitative imaging biomarkers. So that really is sort of switched our lab's focus to understand the biology behind imaging so that we can drive a lot of these innovations from the bench to the bedside.\",\n      \"speaking duration\": 57,\n      \"nods_others\": 0,\n      \"smile_self\": 0.0,\n      \"smile_other\": 0.0,\n      \"distracted_others\": 0,\n      \"hand_gesture\": \"None\",\n      \"interuption\": \"No\",\n      \"overlap\": \"No\",\n      \"screenshare\": \"No\",\n      \"screenshare_content\": \"None\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"speaker\": \"Richard Wiener\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"06:22-06:24\",\n      \"transcript\": \"Great.\",\n      \"speaking duration\": 2,\n      \"nods_others\": 0,\n      \"smile_self\": 0.0,\n      \"smile_other\": 0.0,\n      \"distracted_others\": 0,\n      \"hand_gesture\": \"None\",\n      \"interuption\": \"No\",\n      \"overlap\": \"No\",\n      \"screenshare\": \"No\",\n      \"screenshare_content\": \"None\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"speaker\": \"Alda Ebrahimi\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"06:24-06:28\",\n      \"transcript\": \"I can go.

I'm Sarah. I'm a developmental pediatrician in training. Um I was recently introduced to this group and my research focuses on precision medicine for developmental pediatrics. So um using precision precision medicine approaches like machine learning to better understand neurodevelopmental conditions um in children with neurodevelopmental conditions essentially um applied to big data. Um so this would include children with autism intellectual disability that sort of thing. Um I think I'm here because my PhD which is well before all my clinical training was in the neuroscience of the gut and the enteric nervous system and so um I have this I have this fantasy to combine this very basic science work I did in my early 20s with what I do now seeing patients with neurodevelopmental conditions and seeing if some of the strategies um that are coming out of science these days might be able to help my patients with some of their conditions. So yeah, I'm I'm excited to be here.\",\n      \"speaking duration\": 62,\n      \"nods_others\": 0,\n      \"smile_self\": 0.0,\n      \"smile_other\": 0.0,\n      \"distracted_others\": 0,\n      \"hand_gesture\": \"None\",\n      \"interuption\": \"No\",\n      \"overlap\": \"No\",\n      \"screenshare\": \"No\",\n      \"screenshare_content\": \"None\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"speaker\": \"Richard Wiener\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"07:30-07:32\",\n      \"transcript\": \"Thank you.\",\n      \"speaking duration\": 2,\n      \"nods_others\": 0,\n      \"smile_self\": 0.0,\n      \"smile_other\": 0.0,\n      \"distracted_others\": 0,\n      \"hand_gesture\": \"None\",\n      \"interuption\": \"No\",\n      \"overlap\": \"No\",\n      \"screenshare\": \"No\",\n      \"screenshare_content\": \"None\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"speaker\": \"Richard Wiener\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"07:33-07:36\",\n      \"transcript\": \"All right, who who needs to go next?\",\n      \"speaking duration\": 3,\n      \"nods_others\": 0,\n      \"smile_self\": 0.0,\n      \"smile_other\": 0.0,\n      \"distracted_others\": 0,\n      \"hand_gesture\": \"None\",\n      \"interuption\": \"No\",\n      \"overlap\": \"No\",\n      \"screenshare\": \"No\",\n      \"screenshare_content\": \"None\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"speaker\": \"Richard Wiener\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"07:41-07:43\",\n      \"transcript\": \"Who hasn't gone?\",\n      \"speaking duration\": 2,\n      \"nods_others\": 0,\n      \"smile_self\": 0.0,\n      \"smile_other\": 0.0,\n      \"distracted_others\": 0,\n      \"hand_gesture\": \"None\",\n      \"interuption\": \"No\",\n      \"overlap\": \"No\",\n      \"screenshare\": \"No\",\n      \"screenshare_content\": \"None\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"speaker\": \"Michael Burton\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"07:43-07:44\",\n      \"transcript\": \"I think that's everybody.\",\n      \"speaking duration\": 1,\n      \"nods_others\": 0,\n      \"smile_self\": 0.0,\n      \"smile_other\": 0.0,\n      \"distracted_others\": 0,\n      \"hand_gesture\": \"None\",\n      \"interuption\": \"No\",\n      \"overlap\": \"No\",\n      \"screenshare\": \"No\",\n      \"screenshare_content\": \"None\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"speaker\": \"Richard Wiener\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"07:46-07:51\",\n      \"transcript\": \"Okay.
