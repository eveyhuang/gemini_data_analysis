And then AI coupled with first principle calculations identify what are the type of defects or what transition metals that can actually be thermodynamic stable to make them and they are good to um for that application. And so then they guide the experimentalist that you know, don't build your material, molydenum disulfide for example with manganese. It is good, it is it is good for HER process for this catalytic process. And there has been a lot of discoveries actually that are like um again, I I I think in terms of the super conductivity that's also the same. They were actually started with computational results and they predicted that this is going to be like with a 1.1 degree for example you are going to get super conductivity. It started with and then people could do it. So you just focus on it.",

And we're able to show that you know, certain areas of the brain, there was structural change may actually say that's because we had this rosemary and we had this microstructural change over here and that's due to, you know, bifidobacterium in the gut.

I'll take the example of uh you know, gut microbiome data that people are looking into. So there are ways to do some type of permutation analysis, an over analysis. There's various statistical ways to kind of see what variance in particular microbial contributes most to uh the the clinical end point you have in mind. So let's say you have uh I'll just go back to my point earlier. Let's say you have like a thousand microbes. Yeah, you could kind of bin them down to particular principle components.
