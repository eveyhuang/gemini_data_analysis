And that they can mine the data, existing data. Um, there are a lot of reports that they I was actually looking at some review papers like studying germ free um mice and then uh uh some specific SPF mice. So uh those data are out there.

Of course those approaches are needed as a standard to compare with. But if we want to see in real time what is going on then those sensors can be integrated or embedded in that in vitro or in vivo model.
