I don't know, circulation or enterohepatic circulation and that helps. So in an on this structure we can actually look at that, you know, lipids that could be produced by liver and then in turn fed to the microbiome. Who knows what happens to those um",

And it's not just the the BBB in of itself, you know, there's been the recent discovery of the lymphatic system and how, you know, the lymphatic system acts as a conduit for a lot of these peripheral immune factors. Um, you know, as you know, you know, peripheral macrophages, uh, and T cells are also able to cross the BBB. Um, we don't really have the sensitivity to image the BBB except to say like, you know, if I had a giant gleoblastoma, we can tell you that it's ostensibly pretty leaky at that point.",

Is it the short chain fatty acids that are generated by the gut microbiota that just that drive a lot of these physiologic changes that we see. Or is it the intrinsic physiologic things that are mediated certain metabolites. Um, so I'm trying not to leave out trimethylamine oxide. And actually trimethylamine oxide is generated by uh FMO oxidation. So that's kind of getting to the sort of system. So if you know the walls of the two, you know, the epithelial cells and bacteria, but if you know the metabolites, the communication",
