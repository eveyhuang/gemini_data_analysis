So we have a few questions cued up. Um, what is the diversity of messages that pass back and forth between the gut microbiome and the brain? Are these unidirectional or bidirectional channels of communication? Are there ways to perturb neuronal function to watch the microbial response and how can these communication signals be monitored, hijacked or interrupted to drive desired outcomes. ",

Um, for example, so one of my colleagues here at Yale recently had a really nice paper showing this isn't gut brain in this case, but uh but brain uh immune connection where he showed actually that stress can lead to um uh a nervous system mediated activation of adipocytes to release IL6, um an inflammatory cytokine. Um, I think there's also some really interesting, I was talking about this in the last group as well actually. Um, you know, examples of uh even uh conditioning of immune responses, so classical conditioning of immune responses, again suggesting true bidirectional communication because basically uh, you know, what what one of the things that was shown a couple decades ago, um is that you can condition allergic responses. Uh, so if you give a neutral stimulus, ring a bell and give an allergen, ring a bell and give an allergen, ring a bell and give an allergen, eventually you can ring the bell and all the mass cells in the body will degranulate um without the allergen being present. Um, so that really truly does suggest bidirectional because this type this information had to be encoded from the immune cells being the initial responders, um presumably, although could be direct neuronal sensing as well. There's now evidence for that, but at least the model at the time was that it's initially the mass cells that are sensing, talking to the neurons, the neurons talking to the brain, eventually the brain learning that the proper response to this stimulus um is uh is an allergic response and then encoding that as a learned behavior. Um, and becomes almost an anticipatory behavior and you have these kind of anecdotes of people who are the the famous story my PI used to tell was that he had a uh he had a friend who who insisted that she was allergic to the sight of her of her ex-boyfriend. Um, that she would see him and start to, you know, break out in hives. And um, yeah, so anyway that I probably other people on this can comment maybe even better than I can, but I I think definitely there's lots of opportunities for that kind of bidirectional communication and you can imagine that happening in the gut as well.

So so the methodology uh we we actually this is not a big direction my lab. So we are um developing nanometer positioning platform, which is scanning probe technology. You can position the sensing probe with nanometer resolution. Um so so we did that with the colinergic transmitters from California model. So we basically learned that the concentration of colinergic transmitters is like two molar. It's really dynamically changing. It's not like a flat level. So the highest level we get is like two molar. Um, so overall, you know, there are studies also uh based on like extracellular studies and simulation also tells that information as well. But I you know, I totally agree with like you know, Judith just mentioned besides synaptic transmission, there is also like volume transmission as well. like release from the cells, those also matters a lot. in the brain, so.

I I think one thing one other maybe related somewhat to at least what what um Judith is alluding to um of you know, again bioavailability, controlling bioavailability. I think it's important to remember that most of these things are actually absorbed via active transport um via channels. It's not that they're just magically going across the barrier and so um small intestinal versus large intestinal organization is also really critical because many more chemicals will actually be absorbed um in the small intestine and so the you know, you can imagine scenarios where if you have aberrant expansion of taxa in the small intestine that are making chemicals bioactive compounds that that may have very different effects than that than they would have if they had stayed in the colon where that that chemical just isn't transported or absorbed at all. Um so I think it's a really important point that we need to always keep in mind that all plays into this question of, you know, the key million dollar question of are these things actually make it to the making it to the places where we think they might be biologically relevant at concentrations that are sufficient to engage whatever host systems.
