Um, what is the diversity of messages that pass back and forth between the gut microbiome and the brain? Are these unidirectional or bidirectional channels of communication? Are there ways to perturb neuronal function to watch the microbial response and how can these communication signals be monitored, hijacked or interrupted to drive desired outcomes.",

So how uh how does the nervous system initially get wired up? I think one of the big revelations of the let previous decade is that it's not just mom's genes and and then the your genes, but there all these other organisms with genes that are associated at least with vertebrates and they uh make molecules that uh certainly have effects on the process, not just in the nervous system but other parts of the of the animal. But um and and we don't know very much about that. I think we we've learned uh much more at this point about later effects of the microbiome on the nervous system in terms of disease states and so forth, but we don't really don't know very much about the initial initial wiring and how that might set the animal up to be predisposed or not to what happens later.",

Uh one of them is methodology development and we are interested in developing electrochemical sensing probes that can monitor the neurotransmitters at the time scale of reoccurrence, like break communication, like namely at like millisecond um time scale. And we are also interested to make this sensing probes to be pretty small, like nanometer in size. So for example, we have a published paper where we can make them to be like 15 nanometer in radius. So we can probe synaptic neurotransmission. And currently we we are interested in prove multiple groups of neurotransmitters. Uh and very often those are like involved in neurological disorders and also um look into new methodologies to monitor uh electrical as well as chemical break communication at the same time. Yeah, I'm interesting Alzheimer's disease as well. Nice to meet you all.",

Um, for example, so one of my colleagues here at Yale recently had a really nice paper showing this isn't gut brain in this case, but uh but brain uh immune connection where he showed actually that stress can lead to um uh a nervous system mediated activation of adipocytes to release IL6, um an inflammatory cytokine. Um, I think there's also some really interesting, I was talking about this in the last group as well actually. Um, you know, examples of uh even uh conditioning of immune responses, so classical conditioning of immune responses, again suggesting true bidirectional communication because basically uh, you know, what what one of the things that was shown a couple decades ago, um is that you can condition allergic responses. Uh, so if you give a neutral stimulus, ring a bell and give an allergen, ring a bell and give an allergen, ring a bell and give an allergen, eventually you can ring the bell and all the mass cells in the body will degranulate um without the allergen being present. Um, so that really truly does suggest bidirectional because this type this information had to be encoded from the immune cells being the initial responders, um presumably, although could be direct neuronal sensing as well. There's now evidence for that, but at least the model at the time was that it's initially the mass cells that are sensing, talking to the neurons, the neurons talking to the brain, eventually the brain learning that the proper response to this stimulus um is uh is an allergic response and then encoding that as a learned behavior. Um, and becomes almost an anticipatory behavior and you have these kind of anecdotes of people who are the the famous story my PI used to tell was that he had a uh he had a friend who who insisted that she was allergic to the sight of her of her ex-boyfriend. Um, that she would see him and start to, you know, break out in hives. And um, yeah, so anyway that I probably other people on this can comment maybe even better than I can, but I I think definitely there's lots of opportunities for that kind of bidirectional communication and you can imagine that happening in the gut as well.",

There's just a huge overlap, this kind of common chemical languages. Um so what you really want to know is what's actually coming from the microbes in the gut. And so Andrew Mcpherson did this experiment where they did heavy labeling of um of microbes and then did a colon irreversible colonization of germ free mice. So these were auxotrophic bacteria that um couldn't grow on their own unless they have, you know, the the right supplements. Um, so basically they were able to put in these bacteria that were heavy labeled and then track all of the metabolites specifically that had come from those bacteria across the body. Um, this was maybe a year ago or something that they published this. So I thought this was to I think this is a yeah, one very, very elegant, expensive but elegant way to actually prove uh a microbial origin um for those kinds of compounds. They didn't really do it and I don't think they actually looked in the brain at all. They only looked in circulation.

So you could you could certainly think of all sorts of desensitization processes going on and every every neurotransmitter has some sort of re uptake process. So you can imagine that uh systemic neurotransmitters that could get through the blood brain barrier maybe rather than working synaptically are are altering um re uptake. So altering levels of excitation or inhibition or ratios of excitation and inhibition which I thought to be very, very important in in many sort of uh neurodevelopmental disease processes, probably other processes too.",

So so the methodology uh we we actually this is not a big direction my lab. So we are um developing nanometer positioning platform, which is scanning probe technology. You can position the sensing probe with nanometer resolution. Um so so we did that with the colinergic transmitters from California model. So we basically learned that the concentration of colinergic transmitters is like two molar. It's really dynamically changing. It's not like a flat level. So the highest level we get is like two molar. Um, so overall, you know, there are studies also uh based on like extracellular studies and simulation also tells that information as well.

It's small intestinal tough tough cells that respond to succinate. And that actually makes sense. So the organization of the system is such that we've evolved to avoid sensing the microbial succinate and segregated the expression of the receptor to sense it away from the bacteria. And I think actually that's mostly the design principle is for us to try to design in the majority of cases uh systems where we're not being manipulated by these constant signals or noise. Um the same goes for actually this is a subject I've been fascinated by for a while is that, you know, we secrete tons and tons and tons of um monoamine oxidase into the lumen of the gut. Um mostly this isn't really taught, but actually in the gut lumen there's tons and tons and tons of monoamine oxidase. Um which presumably is there to basically degrade all of these signals before they even get to us. Um of course on the flip side there are going to be those instances that we've evolved to sense things to either to monitor the structure or function of the microbial community or the integrity of the barrier. But I think actually those are the exceptions to the rule. The rule is that we try to not have this these things muck with our gears. Um and then choose a small subset of them to actually monitor and respond to that's kind of our our the sentinel signal.

Um I mean I think there's been some there are kind of anecdotal ways that people have somewhat done this where you do track particular bugs by fish in terms of where they get um you know, are they going into the intermucus layer but you know, kind of the more fine scale resolution is difficult. I I think one thing one other maybe related somewhat to at least what what um Judith is alluding to um of you know, again bioavailability, controlling bioavailability. I think it's important to remember that most of these things are actually absorbed via active transport um via channels. It's not that they're just magically going across the barrier and so um small intestinal versus large intestinal organization is also really critical because many more chemicals will actually be absorbed um in the small intestine and so the you know, you can imagine scenarios where if you have aberrant expansion of taxa in the small intestine that are making chemicals bioactive compounds that that may have very different effects than that than they would have if they had stayed in the colon where that that chemical just isn't transported or absorbed at all. Um so I think it's a really important point that we need to always keep in mind that all plays into this question of, you know, the key million dollar question of are these things actually make it to the making it to the places where we think they might be biologically relevant at concentrations that are sufficient to engage whatever host systems. Um which is one that yeah, again is often hard really hard to answer and we answer it using the proxies of some sort of um change in phenotype. But often those are just proxies.",
