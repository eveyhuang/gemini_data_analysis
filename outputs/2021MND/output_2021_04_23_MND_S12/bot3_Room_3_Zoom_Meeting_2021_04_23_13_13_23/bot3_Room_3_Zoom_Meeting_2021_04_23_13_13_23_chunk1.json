So we have a few questions cued up. Um, what is the diversity of messages that pass back and forth between the gut microbiome and the brain? Are these unidirectional or bidirectional channels of communication? Are there ways to perturb neuronal function to watch the microbial response and how can these communication signals be monitored, hijacked or interrupted to drive desired outcomes.",

So how uh how does the nervous system initially get wired up? I think one of the big revelations of the let previous decade is that it's not just mom's genes and and then the your genes, but there all these other organisms with genes that are associated at least with vertebrates and they uh make molecules that uh certainly have effects on the process, not just in the nervous system but other parts of the of the animal. But um and and we don't know very much about that. I think we we've learned uh much more at this point about later effects of the microbiome on the nervous system in terms of disease states and so forth, but we don't really don't know very much about the initial initial wiring and how that might set the animal up to be predisposed or not to what happens later.",

So I have appointment in Department of Chemistry as well as Neuroscience program and the Department of Bioengineering. So my interests are in two folds. Uh one of them is methodology development and we are interested in developing electrochemical sensing probes that can monitor the neurotransmitters at the time scale of reoccurrence, like break communication, like namely at like millisecond um time scale. And we are also interested to make this sensing probes to be pretty small, like nanometer in size. So for example, we have a published paper where we can make them to be like 15 nanometer in radius. So we can probe synaptic neurotransmission. And currently we we are interested in prove multiple groups of neurotransmitters. Uh and very often those are like involved in neurological disorders and also um look into new methodologies to monitor uh electrical as well as chemical break communication at the same time. Yeah, I'm interesting Alzheimer's disease as well. Nice to meet you all.",
