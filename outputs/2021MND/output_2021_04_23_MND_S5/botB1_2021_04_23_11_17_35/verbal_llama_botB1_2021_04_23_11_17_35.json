And I think, I mean that's what like the basic science mind thinks about. I mean that's I guess what I used to do in grad school, right? You like break something down and then try to understand it. Now, as a clinician, I think and some of the other um people, I'm sorry, I can't see your names right away, but um we're just talking about, you know, talking from the sort of top like top down. So you take the whole person and what can you detect in the whole person that gives you a biomarker. And I've been thinking about this a lot in autism because I've been doing some neuroimaging work trying to find like a neuroimaging biomarker in autism. I mean first of all, autism is not one thing. I think there's in 10 years we're going to know there's like 15 things we used to call autism and there's genetic autism, there's idiopathic autism, there's blah blah blah, right? But anyways, so you take this top down approach and to me a biomarker is not necessarily one thing, it's a collection of things that's almost like a fingerprint, you know, like the biomarker is a signature that's not that's not one thing you do a lab test for.

So how does the microbiome um either changes following exposure to all these cocktails of contaminants that we are adding to the environment that humans are now exposed to that they weren't exposed to and how does this microbiome both changes as a results of that, um, impact in fact impacting your development and uh, and then the other way around too, how does the microbiome changes those contaminants and what is the output um compounds from that and then how do these impact uh the the health of the individual.

So it's not representative of of your sample. So I mean the trick is just to try to your best to work in the same conditions as so if you're like in anoxic environment, obviously you have to keep your your sample anoxic and um it's it's it's timing too have to be fast. You know, you can't let it sit around for two weeks before you do the measurements has to be done uh as soon as possible. So you try to mitigate, you know, a change in conditions in order to maintain that. Uh for the speciation itself, it really depends on which metals you're working with.
