Um just a snippet of what we kind of do in the in the intersection of microbiome and neurobiology. We're looking at the role of gut bacteria in causing alpha synuclein aggregation in the gut. We know that alpha synuclein the alpha synuclein aggregates are involved Parkinson's disease. Those aggregates um there's a lot of evidence suggesting that they originate in the gut before they um end up in the brain and they get there through the vagus nerve. We're studying the role of dopamine and iron, specifically iron speciation um in the gut um in order to actually um sort of map how how alpha synuclein happens and which bacteria are involved and what the specific chemical environment is.

So we have electrochemical methods and uh colorimetric methods. But that's how we try to do it.

So so I guess it would be more interesting more useful in that context, like ex vivo um context. I don't know how that would work in vivo. I mean, there are ways of there there are ways of engineering uh wearables and pills that you can, you know, you can take orally and then uh they have the biosensors incorporated and and they can sense as they go through the GI tract um and report on what they're sensing.

To me, you start with the disease and you start with patient cohorts that have have that early stage disease and you start with screening those patients for give us a few hits, something that's either taxonomically or metabolically different or worth uh pursuing in those things. So to me it starts out with clean cohorts of patients. Um perhaps you choose a disease that has a fairly well defined early phenotype that you can detect it early. Um so some of what Elizabeth is doing with alpha for example. Um and then once you have that disease specific information, I think then you jump into models and you put those things in in mice or in dishes and try to manipulate from there. But as long as the question is directly tying to early stage neurological disease, there's so many caveats with models. I think you have to start with people and then go backwards.

And I think, I mean that's what like the basic science mind thinks about. I mean that's I guess what I used to do in grad school, right? You like break something down and then try to understand it. Now, as a clinician, I think and some of the other um people, I'm sorry, I can't see your names right away, but um we're just talking about, you know, talking from the sort of top like top down. So you take the whole person and what can you detect in the whole person that gives you a biomarker. And I've been thinking about this a lot in autism because I've been doing some neuroimaging work trying to find like a neuroimaging biomarker in autism. I mean first of all, autism is not one thing. I think there's in 10 years we're going to know there's like 15 things we used to call autism and there's genetic autism, there's idiopathic autism, there's blah blah blah, right? But anyways, so you take this top down approach and to me a biomarker is not necessarily one thing, it's a collection of things that's almost like a fingerprint, you know, like the biomarker is a signature that's not that's not one thing you do a lab test for.",

Is this something that is more widespread and then begin to like map mechanism back up and I Sarah I love this about like, yeah, how can you intervene then early? It's like this early biomarker where you see this is the beginning of a process that ends somewhere we don't want to go and how can we know what that process is so that we can kind of intervene right at the beginning of it. and yeah, I um yeah, I love that.",

And then in some cases like in the ASD models, they actually develop sort of some of the stereotypic behaviors as translated to mice like marble bearing and ultrasonic vocalization and stuff which are typical I guess in that model system of ASD, but they use that to mine metabolomic uh data for microbial metabolites that are say very high in the ASD recipient animals versus the typically developing recipient mice.",

Um, and and dogs too have been trained for many of these things. And I I think about this as well just for uh, I mean this is slightly different tangential, but we study H pylori and some of you may know there's a breath test for that, which is based on bacterial urease production, which can break down urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide, which can be detected using a breath test and I wonder about those as I mean those are again metabolites but small molecule volatiles that can be, I don't know, in terms of biomarkers I think are really fascinating too.",

So in that case, maybe we can also start from for example, this epithelial cell, um, what type of receptor they express? Do they somehow have more preference for certain ligand? Again, that ligand might be the product from the microbe, either protein peptide or metabolite. Um, and then I was looking at the question of our group, seems like what we what we're discussing was a a two-step process. Um, like starting from human patients, that's more like identification of what might be the more relevant biomarker. And then can this knowledge be used to diagnosis or or even treatment. That seems like what uh Starla was describing making uh basically transfer this uh different population of for example, fecal samples to the germ free animal and then see whether that actually recapitulate the pathology. And then maybe going back to the to the human uh study to validate or even predict. Um, seem seems like it's it's like it's like a two step to to first identify and then um validate and predict.",

So when you have a system that function and there are things are produced within the system, which we call like kind of like gross rates, right? Things are just happening within the systems and it doesn't really affect the net output. So, um, you you have your your microbiome any other system and you're exposing it to food and environmental conditions and there are things happening within it, but that necessarily doesn't affect the outside world. But then you have a set of outputs that are the ones that you're actually looking at as your biomarkers that would potentially impact something else in the organism. So that's the way I see this and I am really focused on how do human beings um in general respond to environmental contaminants. So how does the microbiome um either changes following exposure to all these cocktails of contaminants that we are adding to the environment that humans are now exposed to that they weren't exposed to and how does this microbiome both changes as a results of that, um, impact in fact impacting your development and uh, and then the other way around too, how does the microbiome changes those contaminants and what is the output um compounds from that and then how do these impact uh the the health of the individual. So I think that the the way I'm the thing I'm thinking about is a little bit kind of feels like outside of what the discussion here it was going on about.",

This is something that we deal with when we work with sediment or sea water or any any type of matrix where a slight change in redox conditions just going to completely change the species of the metals that you're looking at. So it's not representative of of your sample. So I mean the trick is just to try to your best to work in the same conditions as so if you're like in anoxic environment, obviously you have to keep your your sample anoxic and um it's it's it's timing too have to be fast. You know, you can't let it sit around for two weeks before you do the measurements has to be done uh as soon as possible. So you try to mitigate, you know, a change in conditions in order to maintain that. Uh for the speciation itself, it really depends on which metals you're working with.
