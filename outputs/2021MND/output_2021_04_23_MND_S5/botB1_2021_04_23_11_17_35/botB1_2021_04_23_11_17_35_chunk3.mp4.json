Um, I I guess like when I first saw this question, I think I was thinking sort of like what you were talking about just now Kai, like where you think of this kind of like bottom up approach, like where you say like, okay, you have this cell, this microbiome, it you know, whatever, it's excretes something, we can measure that, that gives us a biomarker. And I think, I mean that's what like the basic science mind thinks about. I mean that's I guess what I used to do in grad school, right? You like break something down and then try to understand it. Now, as a clinician, I think and some of the other um people, I'm sorry, I can't see your names right away, but um we're just talking about, you know, talking from the sort of top like top down. So you take the whole person and what can you detect in the whole person that gives you a biomarker. And I've been thinking about this a lot in autism because I've been doing some neuroimaging work trying to find like a neuroimaging biomarker in autism. I mean first of all, autism is not one thing. I think there's in 10 years we're going to know there's like 15 things we used to call autism and there's genetic autism, there's idiopathic autism, there's blah blah blah, right? But anyways, so you take this top down approach and to me a biomarker is not necessarily one thing, it's a collection of things that's almost like a fingerprint, you know, like the biomarker is a signature that's not that's not one thing you do a lab test for.",

Is this something that is more widespread and then begin to like map mechanism back up and I Sarah I love this about like, yeah, how can you intervene then early? It's like this early biomarker where you see this is the beginning of a process that ends somewhere we don't want to go and how can we know what that process is so that we can kind of intervene right at the beginning of it. and yeah, I um yeah, I love that.",

There've been a couple with like cancer immunotherapy trials um and usually it's a group like with ASD, the studies have been, you know, people who have typical however that's defined clinically symptoms of ASD versus typically behaving controls or for cancer immunotherapy responders versus non responders and so they have those two cohorts and then they collect fecal samples from those, they sequence them, they do all the metagenomic analysis at the human level and then they transfer those samples into germ free animals. And then in some cases like in the ASD models, they actually develop sort of some of the stereotypic behaviors as translated to mice like marble bearing and ultrasonic vocalization and stuff which are typical I guess in that model system of ASD, but they use that to mine metabolomic uh data for microbial metabolites that are say very high in the ASD recipient animals versus the typically developing recipient mice.",
