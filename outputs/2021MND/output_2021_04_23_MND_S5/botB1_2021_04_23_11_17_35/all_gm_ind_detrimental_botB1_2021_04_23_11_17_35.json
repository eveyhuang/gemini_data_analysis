So at the time skill of the occurrence of the neurotransmission. So we also developing uh platforms that can probe different kinds of neurotransmission like chemical transmission as well as electrical transmission. And the third focus is to probe multiple groups of uh small neurotransmitter molecules as well. So for example like in neurodegeneration it all often like involves more than one kind of neurotransmitter.

And I think, I mean that's what like the basic science mind thinks about. I mean that's I guess what I used to do in grad school, right? You like break something down and then try to understand it. Now, as a clinician, I think and some of the other um people, I'm sorry, I can't see your names right away, but um we're just talking about, you know, talking from the sort of top like top down. So you take the whole person and what can you detect in the whole person that gives you a biomarker. And I've been thinking about this a lot in autism because I've been doing some neuroimaging work trying to find like a neuroimaging biomarker in autism. I mean first of all, autism is not one thing.

And then in some cases like in the ASD models, they actually develop sort of some of the stereotypic behaviors as translated to mice like marble bearing and ultrasonic vocalization and stuff which are typical I guess in that model system of ASD, but they use that to mine metabolomic uh data for microbial metabolites that are say very high in the ASD recipient animals versus the typically developing recipient mice.",

This pathway might involve both the microbe intermediate epithelial cell and neuron. So in that case, maybe we can also start from for example, this epithelial cell, um, what type of receptor they express? Do they somehow have more preference for certain ligand? Again, that ligand might be the product from the microbe, either protein peptide or metabolite. Um, and then I was looking at the question of our group, seems like what we what we're discussing was a a two-step process. Um, like starting from human patients, that's more like identification of what might be the more relevant biomarker. And then can this knowledge be used to diagnosis or or even treatment. That seems like what uh Starla was describing making uh basically transfer this uh different population of for example, fecal samples to the germ free animal and then see whether that actually recapitulate the pathology. And then maybe going back to the to the human uh study to validate or even predict. Um, seem seems like it's it's like it's like a two step to to first identify and then um validate and predict.",

But um and then move that system into germ free mice um and ask now they're notobiotic now they're colonized to ask like does this um specific state induce alpha aggregation to a greater degree in the intestine of this animal versus another animal. And I think that's the first step and then I think it allows you to then go back to the humans to say, okay, we found this thing that is an early um at least it can push a system in this direction, can you go back to the human population now and say, well was that actually more prevalent in humans in early stages of disease. Um, and then kind of like cut like go back and forth between those two is how um how we've been working on that.",

So when you have a system that function and there are things are produced within the system, which we call like kind of like gross rates, right? Things are just happening within the systems and it doesn't really affect the net output. So, um, you you have your your microbiome any other system and you're exposing it to food and environmental conditions and there are things happening within it, but that necessarily doesn't affect the outside world. But then you have a set of outputs that are the ones that you're actually looking at as your biomarkers that would potentially impact something else in the organism. So that's the way I see this and I am really focused on how do human beings um in general respond to environmental contaminants. So how does the microbiome um either changes following exposure to all these cocktails of contaminants that we are adding to the environment that humans are now exposed to that they weren't exposed to and how does this microbiome both changes as a results of that, um, impact in fact impacting your development and uh, and then the other way around too, how does the microbiome changes those contaminants and what is the output um compounds from that and then how do these impact uh the the health of the individual.

This is something that we deal with when we work with sediment or sea water or any any type of matrix where a slight change in redox conditions just going to completely change the species of the metals that you're looking at. So it's not representative of of your sample. So I mean the trick is just to try to your best to work in the same conditions as so if you're like in anoxic environment, obviously you have to keep your your sample anoxic and um it's it's it's timing too have to be fast. You know, you can't let it sit around for two weeks before you do the measurements has to be done uh as soon as possible. So you try to mitigate, you know, a change in conditions in order to maintain that. Uh for the speciation itself, it really depends on which metals you're working with.
