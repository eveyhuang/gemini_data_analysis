Um, I don't know if you guys have heard about these some student of mine did it for a journal club like super smelling humans who can smell like volatiles produced by people with Parkinson's and certain other neuropathologies. Um, and and dogs too have been trained for many of these things. And I I think about this as well just for uh, I mean this is slightly different tangential, but we study H pylori and some of you may know there's a breath test for that, which is based on bacterial urease production, which can break down urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide, which can be detected using a breath test and I wonder about those as I mean those are again metabolites but small molecule volatiles that can be, I don't know, in terms of biomarkers I think are really fascinating too.",

Um and in Parkinson's disease they're triggering uh an uh neuroinflammatory response in the brain. And so um it's also kind of interesting to think about like the duality of these different metabolites and how they can be beneficial in some context but not in others. And I think that kind of goes back to this idea of this it's it's not we're not looking for one thing usually, but like it's a fingerprint, it's a collection and what do all of these things mean together um rather than than than individually.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I just I just had a thought, you know, echoing what just Elizabeth said, it's typically a circuit, maybe a circuit or a subset of the pathway. This pathway might involve both the microbe intermediate epithelial cell and neuron. So in that case, maybe we can also start from for example, this epithelial cell, um, what type of receptor they express? Do they somehow have more preference for certain ligand? Again, that ligand might be the product from the microbe, either protein peptide or metabolite. Um, and then I was looking at the question of our group, seems like what we what we're discussing was a a two-step process. Um, like starting from human patients, that's more like identification of what might be the more relevant biomarker. And then can this knowledge be used to diagnosis or or even treatment. That seems like what uh Starla was describing making uh basically transfer this uh different population of for example, fecal samples to the germ free animal and then see whether that actually recapitulate the pathology. And then maybe going back to the to the human uh study to validate or even predict. Um, seem seems like it's it's like it's like a two step to to first identify and then um validate and predict.",

Like for for instance release of neurotransmitters from the cells again some information about some of this process as well. Of course, right, control experiments can be carried out between like you know health and disease models. Um, yeah, so I know like you know we we just talked about like genetic factors, also have mentioned about some like environmental like you know diet, right, history, exercise, all of those do matters, right? So this is really add like you know another level of complexity when you try to look for the biomarkers because it varies from people to people, right? Um, yeah, perhaps we have don't know, maybe some kind of more complex strategy can be developed to normalize those environmental factors. I don't know if that is possible.",

So what we want to say um what we're doing is saying, we have a a very um precise mechanism that shows how gut bacteria are specifically triggering alpha in this instance. But um and then move that system into germ free mice um and ask now they're notobiotic now they're colonized to ask like does this um specific state induce alpha aggregation to a greater degree in the intestine of this animal versus another animal. And I think that's the first step and then I think it allows you to then go back to the humans to say, okay, we found this thing that is an early um at least it can push a system in this direction, can you go back to the human population now and say, well was that actually more prevalent in humans in early stages of disease. Um, and then kind of like cut like go back and forth between those two is how um how we've been working on that.",
