I I don't know how to do it. Um but yeah, the this complexity is is is something that that we need to address.",

I'm curious, um, because we, um, have seen with different kinds of like dietary manipulations that certainly there is like some still variation even in in the the response or the activity. Do people know what the exact activity even we want to modulate for, um, benefiting, um, you know, neurobiology?",

I I don't think there's one thing we can point to that's that's universal for a neurological outcome. But there's definitely examples of specific things. So like ketogenic diet for epilepsy for instance is shown to modulate uh glutamate and glutamine ratios in the brain. And so that's one very specific thing. But I don't think we can generally make some argument that modulating the microbiome in a certain way will always have a neurological effect.",

            "transcript": "I mean, I'm a bit curious about the term modulation over here. Like if you think about electronics and telecommunication and you know, things like that, you have a periodic waveform and then you, you know, try to change the, you know, amplitude of it or, you know, the frequency of that in a time in a temporal fashion. Okay. So are we, you know, going to follow a line of thought where we think that the signals that are generated by the microbes that are present in the gut vary as a function of time and do we then want to change those signals as a function of time and do we think there is a, you know, cyclic repetition of those of the production of those signals?",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I may may I think, you know, to that point, I think there's the there's a potentially difference between, you know, modulating the composition or the function, right? I think, you know, if we if we define what are the functions, you know, functional modules that are interesting or targets for for perturbation, um, I think that's going to be really key to to all of this because then you can define the the genetic material which you can then for example, drop into a microbe or uh identify microbiota that, you know, exists in in in in a natural community as a source for probiotic supplementation, right? Um I I do think there's a whole component of spatial temporal variation and and how we think about delivery that's important. So, um, you know, for example, a lot of the the analysis are are done on like fecal samples, right? If you if you actually want to get it into the small intestine, like that's going to be, you know, potentially much more challenging where you you you need to require complete different tools. So, um, I think both like very, you know, how do you control that in space as well as in time, um, and there probably just different ways to think about that.",

Um and then try to supplement with this specific molecule rather than trying to change microbial composition because this is this is challenging. Um yeah.",

            "transcript": "I think another thing to following up on that is to consider the timeline of an intervention that would modulate the microbiome, for example, supplementing with metabolites and and um what's the permanence of that versus so for example, like I think a lot of early probiotic data at least suggests that, you know, even like the the bacteria in yogurt, for example, that will only transiently colonize your gut for a couple days and then pass through. So if you're thinking about effective strategies for modulating the microbiome, what kind of time scale are we talking about? Um this is more of a long-term question and like if you were thinking of a clinical intervention or something, but would this be come in the form of a supplement that you would have to administer like multiple",
