One is we study the well we try to study the structure of the microbiome and we are focused on the oral microbiome at this point, but we are also dabbling into the gut microbiome a bit. And we try to understand what are the factors that shape the microbiota essentially. And then the other project is on the type nine secretion system, which is a secretion system found in bacteria of the phyla bacteroidetes and we are trying to understand what are the, you know, sensory regulators of that secretion system and how secretion of proteins via that secretion system in and with animal model would lead to physiological changes downstream.",
