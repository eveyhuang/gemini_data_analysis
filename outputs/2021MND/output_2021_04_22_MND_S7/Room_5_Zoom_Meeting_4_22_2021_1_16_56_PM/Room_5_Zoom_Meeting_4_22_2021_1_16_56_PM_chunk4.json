Um so maybe picking something that can be present in normal healthy states but also those same mechanisms that go array in disorders. Does that make sense? I don't know if that's fully formed or fleshed out but something that's consistent across.",

We don't know which disease this is we have just identified two states and we do a metabolic profiling of somehow their gut which I don't even know how it's possible but maybe some sort of blood samples could be drawn and we can do their metabolic profiling and we compare what sort of metabolites are present or absent in the two samples, okay? And then we go back to see which of these metabolites could be produced by microbes, okay? So that would at least give us a sense of you know how this disease could be you know at least can have a correlation with microbial metabolites, okay? And then we can think about modulating those. Is that a decent approach or is that are there flaws in this approach? I mean I just thought it on the fly so there might be some.",

So let's it sounds like what we've talked about is that let's assume that you know there's a hopefully a small number of metabolites that are um associated with disease. The approaches that I guess I've heard so far include things like um if you're lucky and some of these are specific enough to be associated with known genes or pathways for production, you can um potentially introduce those genes if you wanted to make more of it or I guess um maybe if you knew what um metabolized or or degraded those metabolites, maybe you'd have genes that go in that actually sort of hopefully like lower their abundance. Other ideas are if you could introduce like probiotic organisms that um might also be associated with levels of those metabolites. The one that comes to mind for me is like a a dietary to link if any of them are sort of associated with breakdown of known nutrients or dietary nutrients. Um and then there are also I guess pharmacological interventions if some of them are known to be um at the very least even like uh or as Deborah mentioned like antibiotics at the very least to just show that there's like bacterial manipulation of those things.",

And then you're essentially treating that microbe is is like a drug production or delivery vehicle, right? And that could go into the the challenge with that is that you have to do dosing and then the pharmacal kinetics of that is really hard. Um and the variation between people is really challenging so that, you know, what works in one individual may not work in another, right? Um and then so there's the, you know, FMT transplantation uh approach uh but that's mostly just based off of the natural microbiota variation that exists. So one could I I suppose uh combine that with some type of engineering approach where you now you're engineering some natural member of the community um uh with this new functionality and so either given given that as a single strain or multiple collection of strains that then hopefully could could graft. I suppose you could do this autologously in a personalized way as we've mentioned, right? maybe either Xvo so that could you know help you um with some of the, you know, colonization resistance, you know, uh issues. Um yeah, I think kind of probably the biggest challenge in this is is really kind of getting the therapeutic kind of doses right uh and and getting it to the places that needs to go whether it's in the small intestine and you know, in in the large intestine, um, you know, need to get enough, you know, in the mucosal uh regions for it to be uh bioactive, for example, um, yeah.",
