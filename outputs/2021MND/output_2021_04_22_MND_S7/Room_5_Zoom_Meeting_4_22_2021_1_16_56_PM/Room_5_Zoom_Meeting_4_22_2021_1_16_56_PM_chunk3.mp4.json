We just don't have the equivalence of that um here I feel like and so maybe that's a potential input that would be useful um you know, for the microbiome.",

Uh and and certainly like whether you collect it in one um population is that the same as the next one? you know, it's it's it's and it's also a very kinetic, you know, it's a dynamic process.

And and that's why I think that the targeting the downstream activity of bacteria is something that is that um holds maybe more potential compared to to try and and target specific species or colonize with specific bacteria and then you bypass any issues of colonization and and complexity of the microbiome and and effect on the community and and so on. So it's not like a huge kind of uh drug screen that you can do, but you can do some screening in in in tissue culture or in organoids model or in um cultured neurons.",

I I think that that seems like it's it's one of the bigger challenges uh which is why I was saying even in the animal model, you know, I guess if you run human clinical trials, you can at least ask people for that kind of feedback versus in in animals then you you're resorting to these, you know, behavioral studies which are are really kind of labor intensive and uh you know, the cohorts that you have to deal with um, you know, especially if you're doing kind of daily dosing of your, you know, intervention um it it's uh it's it's it's quite challenging.
