But how is that signal, that inflammatory signal being potentiated from the gut to the brain. And I think there's probably a session tomorrow uh on neuroinflammation specifically that we can all talk about. Um, but there's you know, these cell dependent effects where peripheral immune cells are getting are being trained in the gut or getting signals directly from the gut and then crossing to the brain. But there's also the fact that uh the the descending signals from the brain from the spinal cord and from the Vegas are actively also receiving these inflammatory signals. And we don't quite know how inflammation in the gut is telling those pathways um to become dysfunctional or or have altered function.

And then you're essentially treating that microbe is is like a drug production or delivery vehicle, right? And that could go into the the challenge with that is that you have to do dosing and then the pharmacal kinetics of that is really hard. Um and the variation between people is really challenging so that, you know, what works in one individual may not work in another, right? Um and then so there's the, you know, FMT transplantation uh approach uh but that's mostly just based off of the natural microbiota variation that exists. So one could I I suppose uh combine that with some type of engineering approach where you now you're engineering some natural member of the community um uh with this new functionality and so either given given that as a single strain or multiple collection of strains that then hopefully could could graft. I suppose you could do this autologously in a personalized way as we've mentioned, right? maybe either Xvo so that could you know help you um with some of the, you know, colonization resistance, you know, uh issues. Um yeah, I think kind of probably the biggest challenge in this is is really kind of getting the therapeutic kind of doses right uh and and getting it to the places that needs to go whether it's in the small intestine and you know, in in the large intestine, um, you know, need to get enough, you know, in the mucosal uh regions for it to be uh bioactive, for example, um, yeah.

Uh one thing that we kind of touched on, but may we may want to mention here also is specificity of of whatever intervention we're considering. So I know we narrowed it down to thinking about one particular metabolite, but the interventions that we're potentially proposing, these diets or just adding the metabolite back. Um or even genetic engineering with something like a phage, either ex vivo or in vivo might have we run into the specificity issue, whether we have something that's not specific enough or something that might be so specific, like a phage that may not necessarily work in the exact strain within that's in that individual. So I think that might be part of that inter individual variation component. ",
