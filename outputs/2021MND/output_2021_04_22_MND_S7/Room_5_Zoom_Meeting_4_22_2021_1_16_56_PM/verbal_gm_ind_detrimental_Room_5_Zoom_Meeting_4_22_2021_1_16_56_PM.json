And for sure, in the future they they might work. And so far we haven't seen any very successful probiotic pill design to decolonize CD even for this very uh simple scenario. For very complicated disease like the uh the neuro uh neurological disorders, uh the printers disorders we are talking about in this conference, I don't think there is a kind of one direction collision.

And so we we definitely know the microbiome modulates systemic immune responses, it modulates neuroimmune responses. But how is that signal, that inflammatory signal being potentiated from the gut to the brain. And I think there's probably a session tomorrow uh on neuroinflammation specifically that we can all talk about. Um, but there's you know, these cell dependent effects where peripheral immune cells are getting are being trained in the gut or getting signals directly from the gut and then crossing to the brain. But there's also the fact that uh the the descending signals from the brain from the spinal cord and from the Vegas are actively also receiving these inflammatory signals. And we don't quite know how inflammation in the gut is telling those pathways um to become dysfunctional or or have altered function.

Other ideas are if you could introduce like probiotic organisms that um might also be associated with levels of those metabolites. The one that comes to mind for me is like a a dietary to link if any of them are sort of associated with breakdown of known nutrients or dietary nutrients.

So one could I I suppose uh combine that with some type of engineering approach where you now you're engineering some natural member of the community um uh with this new functionality and so either given given that as a single strain or multiple collection of strains that then hopefully could could graft.
