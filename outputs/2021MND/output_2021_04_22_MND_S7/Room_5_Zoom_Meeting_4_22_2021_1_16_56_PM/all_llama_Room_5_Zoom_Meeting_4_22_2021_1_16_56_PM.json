But in many cases, that's that's not the case because um I think for the very simple uh um infectious disease like a CD infection, they are very successful uh treatment like the fecal micro transplantation and many other people including many company they are working on probiotic pills try to decolonize this particular pathogen. And for sure, in the future they they might work. And so far we haven't seen any very successful probiotic pill design to decolonize CD even for this very uh simple scenario. For very complicated disease like the uh the neuro uh neurological disorders, uh the printers disorders we are talking about in this conference, I don't think there is a kind of one direction collision. It's very likely is bidirectional. So how can we make sure modulating microbiome will indeed uh benefit the host. Um so very likely you have to do the perturbation in a very consistent way and the in terms of probiotics maybe you have to do the uh administration on on a very um um um in a constant way like on a daily basis for example. Uh I'm not sure if this this is the right way to uh move forward. Um I'm sorry, I'm not very positive on this because I consider this is really a chicken egg problem.

Um, I forget where my thought was going here. But oh, the the mechanism of action by which inflammation might be mediating these these different effects. And so we we definitely know the microbiome modulates systemic immune responses, it modulates neuroimmune responses. But how is that signal, that inflammatory signal being potentiated from the gut to the brain. And I think there's probably a session tomorrow uh on neuroinflammation specifically that we can all talk about. Um, but there's you know, these cell dependent effects where peripheral immune cells are getting are being trained in the gut or getting signals directly from the gut and then crossing to the brain. But there's also the fact that uh the the descending signals from the brain from the spinal cord and from the Vegas are actively also receiving these inflammatory signals. And we don't quite know how inflammation in the gut is telling those pathways um to become dysfunctional or or have altered function. So I think inflammation could be playing a role kind of in those two different two different ways. But also then if inflammation is playing such a big role, then maybe the microbiome we can bypass it if we can, we don't need to necessarily modulate the microbiome if we can modulate inflammation, which there's a lot of really good pharmaceuticals that can do.",

Um, you know, just people have done a number of these probiotic studies and and look at potential effects, but uh very few actual mechanistic kind of, you know, down to the molecule level um insights um, you know, are or at least the ratio of those is is very poor. And so, um are there ways for example that we can drastically increase the throughput at which we can discover new, you know, uh neuromodulatory microbiota um without going through, you know, testing individual strains and then, you know, measuring uh brain activity or other systemic activity because I think that that that cycle seems so slow that um I feel like a lot of effort is going towards that, all right?

Um, it's just impossible to really kind of do at scale um, um, you know, uh, so, you know, certainly we've been thinking about like Xvo experiment where you can kind of do that even though it doesn't faithfully recapitulate all of the vivo um, uh, you know, uh, implications, but it just, you know, at least gives you some uh component because otherwise I just feel like there's so much, you know, variation even for animals, right?

I I think that that seems like it's it's one of the bigger challenges uh which is why I was saying even in the animal model, you know, I guess if you run human clinical trials, you can at least ask people for that kind of feedback versus in in animals then you you're resorting to these, you know, behavioral studies which are are really kind of labor intensive and uh you know, the cohorts that you have to deal with um, you know, especially if you're doing kind of daily dosing of your, you know, intervention um it it's uh it's it's it's quite challenging.

So let's it sounds like what we've talked about is that let's assume that you know there's a hopefully a small number of metabolites that are um associated with disease. The approaches that I guess I've heard so far include things like um if you're lucky and some of these are specific enough to be associated with known genes or pathways for production, you can um potentially introduce those genes if you wanted to make more of it or I guess um maybe if you knew what um metabolized or or degraded those metabolites, maybe you'd have genes that go in that actually sort of hopefully like lower their abundance. Other ideas are if you could introduce like probiotic organisms that um might also be associated with levels of those metabolites. The one that comes to mind for me is like a a dietary to link if any of them are sort of associated with breakdown of known nutrients or dietary nutrients. Um and then there are also I guess pharmacological interventions if some of them are known to be um at the very least even like uh or as Deborah mentioned like antibiotics at the very least to just show that there's like bacterial manipulation of those things.",

And then you're essentially treating that microbe is is like a drug production or delivery vehicle, right? And that could go into the the challenge with that is that you have to do dosing and then the pharmacal kinetics of that is really hard. Um and the variation between people is really challenging so that, you know, what works in one individual may not work in another, right? Um and then so there's the, you know, FMT transplantation uh approach uh but that's mostly just based off of the natural microbiota variation that exists. So one could I I suppose uh combine that with some type of engineering approach where you now you're engineering some natural member of the community um uh with this new functionality and so either given given that as a single strain or multiple collection of strains that then hopefully could could graft. I suppose you could do this autologously in a personalized way as we've mentioned, right? maybe either Xvo so that could you know help you um with some of the, you know, colonization resistance, you know, uh issues. Um yeah, I think kind of probably the biggest challenge in this is is really kind of getting the therapeutic kind of doses right uh and and getting it to the places that needs to go whether it's in the small intestine and you know, in in the large intestine, um, you know, need to get enough, you know, in the mucosal uh regions for it to be uh bioactive, for example, um, yeah.",
