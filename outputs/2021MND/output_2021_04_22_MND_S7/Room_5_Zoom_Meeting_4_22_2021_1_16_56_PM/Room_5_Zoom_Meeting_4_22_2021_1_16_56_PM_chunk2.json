Um, are we thinking about, you know, brain function in terms of activation, are we thinking about cell signaling within different neurons, oxidative stress and is it going to be localized, are we thinking more generalized and you know, inflammation is something that I'm really interested in, like kind of neuroinflammation specifically, you know, like astrocyte active and microglia, like how are like those activated and maybe picking targets that would, you know, have outcomes or looking at those outcomes as opposed to something more broad.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I agree. I think inflammation could be a really great target because it is of the many disorders that I think this this group of people is probably thinking about inflammation does seem to to pop up kind of consistently. Um, I forget where my thought was going here. But oh, the the mechanism of action by which inflammation might be mediating these these different effects. And so we we definitely know the microbiome modulates systemic immune responses, it modulates neuroimmune responses. But how is that signal, that inflammatory signal being potentiated from the gut to the brain. And I think there's probably a session tomorrow uh on neuroinflammation specifically that we can all talk about. Um, but there's you know, these cell dependent effects where peripheral immune cells are getting are being trained in the gut or getting signals directly from the gut and then crossing to the brain. But there's also the fact that uh the the descending signals from the brain from the spinal cord and from the Vegas are actively also receiving these inflammatory signals. And we don't quite know how inflammation in the gut is telling those pathways um to become dysfunctional or or have altered function. So I think inflammation could be playing a role kind of in those two different two different ways. But also then if inflammation is playing such a big role, then maybe the microbiome we can bypass it if we can, we don't need to necessarily modulate the microbiome if we can modulate inflammation, which there's a lot of really good pharmaceuticals that can do.",

            "transcript": "I think one of the other um kind of challenges at least from from my perspective is is that um you know the the microbiome is so complicated, right? And there's so many effectors that are uh that that, you know, whether it's actual individual strains or communities of strains or specific metabolites, how do we go down to the mechanistic level to be able to, you know, find those those specific actors to be then go back for for the engineering component, right? Um, you know, just people have done a number of these probiotic studies and and look at potential effects, but uh very few actual mechanistic kind of, you know, down to the molecule level um insights um, you know, are or at least the ratio of those is is very poor. And so, um are there ways for example that we can drastically increase the throughput at which we can discover new, you know, uh neuromodulatory microbiota um without going through, you know, testing individual strains and then, you know, measuring uh brain activity or other systemic activity because I think that that that cycle seems so slow that um I feel like a lot of effort is going towards that, all right? And so we're almost kind of like if something we see something and then then there's this lamp post effect where, you know, basically all of the work is focused on in those specific areas. The way that we can accelerate that process.",

Do you build, do you trust all the genome scale metabolic models and do you try to put them together and build a network and then predict what is the overall flux of the community going to be and then try to change the balance of that flux or how do you go about doing that? And are are are the genome scale metabolic models actually trustworthy at this point? I don't know the answer to that. Maybe you guys can enlighten a bit.",

So suppose you have a bunch of uh steady roughly steady state samples, then the idea is that the interspecies interactions somehow are encoded in the difference between different steady state samples as long as they share some common species. And mathematically you can you can prove that the the interspecies interactions are somehow encoded in the statistic sample difference. But the point is that this require a large number of samples. Suppose you have 1000 species, then this require more than 5,000 samples with different species of collections. This is a big number and also we require abundance. And suppose you can provide this type of data, then we can reconstruct the network for you. It's ecological network, it's a direct and weighted sign graph.",

There's so many possible targets for many different kinds of types or disease. Um, maybe like another angle on it would be um for a form of like dimensional reduction, like do we have a sense for like even the nature of the interaction that we could target because, you know, is it going to be a signaling hormone or an antigen or a metabolite because even if we have a sense of that, you know, the when you think about manipulating a microbial community, that also kind of constrains how you might think about your your intervention.",

So um yeah, be curious to hear what you all sort of think about about sort of learning from from those types of um uh studies.",

And then Rosie also did a clinical study. So yeah, we do have population diversity data. You know, what sort of diversity you want in the samples if you want to reverse the symptoms for ASD, I say. But then, you know, how do you get them to colonize? How do you get them to adhere? How do you want get them to be long term stable in the gut? So, you know, is colonization something that we want to target if you want to modulate the microbiome? Do you just want things to be planktonic in the gut and maybe some hope that they will colonize? I mean, how do we go ahead with that idea?",

Um, it's just impossible to really kind of do at scale um, um, you know, uh, so, you know, certainly we've been thinking about like Xvo experiment where you can kind of do that even though it doesn't faithfully recapitulate all of the vivo um, uh, you know, uh, implications, but it just, you know, at least gives you some uh component because otherwise I just feel like there's so much, you know, variation even for animals, right? Like, you know, one animal you get from from uh a core is not the same as the next one you you potentially could get and so and different strains of mice will have different kind of challenges. So, um, yeah, I mean, germ free animals is uh is one way to do that, but it's really hard to do like, you know, 100 experiments. It's really",
