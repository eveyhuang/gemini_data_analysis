You know, have a particular to the pathway of interest as long as you one can define what that is. Um, and then put that into specific strains that are already resident in in the microbiome. And uh, you know, as a way for um, you know, the community to be endowed with the function uh while still keeping the rest of the intestinal milieu as consistent as possible. And so, you know, this these type of I think these emergent in situ engineering approaches, it could be quite useful. And so, you know, in terms of the technical side of how could you could do that, you could certainly deliver these genetic material either by phages or potentially by bacterial conjugation.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, one thing I want to discuss with you guys is that uh I think uh when we during the discussion so far, we are assuming that modulating the microbiome somehow can um um um um treat the disease. But in many cases, that's that's not the case because um I think for the very simple uh um infectious disease like a CD infection, they are very successful uh treatment like the fecal micro transplantation and many other people including many company they are working on probiotic pills try to decolonize this particular pathogen. And for sure, in the future they they might work. And so far we haven't seen any very successful probiotic pill design to decolonize CD even for this very uh simple scenario. For very complicated disease like the uh the neuro uh neurological disorders, uh the printers disorders we are talking about in this conference, I don't think there is a kind of one direction collision. It's very likely is bidirectional. So how can we make sure modulating microbiome will indeed uh benefit the host. Um so very likely you have to do the perturbation in a very consistent way and the in terms of probiotics maybe you have to do the uh administration on on a very um um um in a constant way like on a daily basis for example. Uh I'm not sure if this this is the right way to uh move forward. Um I'm sorry, I'm not very positive on this because I consider this is really a chicken egg problem. How can we make sure modulating microbiome will help.",

            "transcript": "I'll piggy back on that because I also while I'm I'm pretty biased that I do think we'll be able to find some things with the microbiome being able to modulate outcomes, I fully agree with this chicken and the egg issue whereby the disease itself is likely undoubtedly causing changes in the gut that is then potentiating some change to the microbiome composition. And so changing the microbiome composition almost no matter how we're going to do it is likely going to have those top down signals that are still detrimental and still selecting potentially for this this pathogenic environment within the gut. So we we have to come at it potentially from from both angles.",
