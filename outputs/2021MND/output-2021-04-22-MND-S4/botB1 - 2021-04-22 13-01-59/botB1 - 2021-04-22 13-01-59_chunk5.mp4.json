Because all those pathways, you say have 50 pathways, they're not all going to contribute to and understand how. Okay, how do we use statistical methods and biological prior knowledge to find the top three that could actually be linked to phenotype. And then that's when you start talking with biologists and then begging them to um to do like experimental validation. Um also something uh JP, you would know this like since you're in radiology, um you know, looking at brain images. I mean brain images of like maybe possibly areas of depending on what areas light up in a particular patient. I'm very new about how brain imaging works, but you know, people start have started you know, some of the recent Alzheimer's papers that I've just I've just reading just out of pure interest. I mean they do FM fMRI imaging and see what areas light up and does that have any statistical correlates with um you know, gut microbiome features or other features in the blood.",

That is the longitudinal study, which is what you just basically it's like large data set home and you just basically mash them together. So we did uh we did a K fold uh validation uh random forest supervised learning study. And we're able to show that you know, certain areas of the brain, there was structural change may actually say that's because we had this rosemary and we had this microstructural change over here and that's due to, you know, bifidobacterium in the gut. Which can make those statistical associations between gut microbial populations in the brain. The the problem with that as you know is these are pure statistical associations and actual biology is a little bit opaque. Like why do we see that? So it's hard to validate uh this sort of studies.",

Uh you were talking about ranking these pathways in order that would be quite stable in the adults over time. What do you use to rank the pathways? Uh I think it's a challenge because there's so many ways to um you know, for example, there's many statistical ways to do this. I'll take the example of uh you know, gut microbiome data that people are looking into. So there are ways to do some type of permutation analysis, an over analysis. There's various statistical ways to kind of see what variance in particular microbial contributes most to uh the the clinical end point you have in mind. So let's say you have uh I'll just go back to my point earlier. Let's say you have like a thousand microbes. Yeah, you could kind of bin them down to particular principle components. Um which I'm sure many in the audience are familiar with that. And then see which principle components um correlates the most with uh with the clinical phenotype that you have. There's various statistical ways to do that.",
