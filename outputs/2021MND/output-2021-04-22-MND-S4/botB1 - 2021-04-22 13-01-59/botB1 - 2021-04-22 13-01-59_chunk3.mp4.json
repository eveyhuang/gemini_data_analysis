So I know I personally don't work on energy for catalysis, but I know there are a lot of computational works that are starting from the first principle calculations and then coupling them with AI to really screen a bunch of different transition metal chalcogenides and chalcogenates to see how they interact with hydrogen and oxygen, very simple molecules to um for energy, for hydrogen evolution reaction or you know, basically for catalysis, you know, catalyzing those reactions. And then AI coupled with first principle calculations identify what are the type of defects or what transition metals that can actually be thermodynamic stable to make them and they are good to um for that application. And so then they guide the experimentalist that you know, don't build your material, molydenum disulfide for example with manganese. It is good, it is it is good for HER process for this catalytic process. And there has been a lot of discoveries actually that are like um again, I I I think in terms of the super conductivity that's also the same. They were actually started with computational results and they predicted that this is going to be like with a 1.1 degree for example you are going to get super conductivity. It started with and then people could do it. So you just focus on it.",
