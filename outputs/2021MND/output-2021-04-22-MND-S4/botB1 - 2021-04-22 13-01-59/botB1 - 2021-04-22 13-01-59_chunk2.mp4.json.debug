I don't know, circulation or enterohepatic circulation that helps out. So in a non-destructive way we can actually look at that. You know, lipids that could be produced by liver and then in turn fed to the microbiome. Who knows what happens to those um",

Um, you know, as you know, you know, usually we think about the brain and microglia as intrinsic, you know, macrophage of the brain, but we also know that peripheral macrophages, uh, and T cells are also able to cross the BBB.

I think that's I think what you're really hitting on is sort of the challenge question, right? Is it the metabolites that are generated by the the gut microbiota that just that drive a lot of these physiologic changes that we see. So the short chain fatty acids we talk about to the receptor on microglia does that cause them to have that effect in the brain. So identifying part of it is not my expertise, but given the data that these are the metabolites that are found, we can talk about the communication part of it because there is enough data available about the epithelial of the gut and how they transport across the membrane or to the epithelial layers which will contribute to the communication part of this question.",
