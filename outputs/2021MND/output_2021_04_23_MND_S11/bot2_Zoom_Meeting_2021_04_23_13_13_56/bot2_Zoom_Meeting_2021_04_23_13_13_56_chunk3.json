So they're kind of mysterious molecules that still have to be studied and so you don't really find much in terms of receptors that they act on or whether they diffuse into the cell and act that way. And so those are more difficult um to study. Um and then other ones that are microbially modulated are pretty common. So a lot of kind of tryptophan derivatives for example and they would be acting on endogenous pathways um that are already available and it's really hard to kind of um target them specifically to study only the microbially derived population.

And so some microbes can make serotonin de novo and then also microbes can stimulate the host to make serotonin. And that could you know, that gets into the bloodstream and it could either diffuse, you know and you know, go to other organ systems or it even could act locally on vagal neurons, which all have serotonin receptors. And so I think it's just complicated by the fact that all of these pathways are co-occurring at the same time that you have probably neuronal acting going on at the same time as diffusion of serotonin and other serotonin related derivatives um and it's kind of um difficult to account for the complexity of these happening in tandem.",

So I think it would be really interesting to study whether or not those types of intervention can impact the the gut and and something that stands that just came to my mind right now is something like transcranial magnetic stimulation. Um, that's commonly used as treatment for depressive disorders and other um psychiatric illnesses that could be really interesting to see how that changes kind of enteric or or gut functioning.",
