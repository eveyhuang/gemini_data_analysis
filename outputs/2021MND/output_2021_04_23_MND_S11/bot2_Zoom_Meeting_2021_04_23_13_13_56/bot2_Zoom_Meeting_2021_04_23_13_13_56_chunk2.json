And I think about this a lot in terms of the Vegas nerve for example, you know, if you go in and you have molecules that are activating or suppressing activity, is there a limited number of kind of messages that are transmitted across this nerve that have a defined functional output like, oh, eat or, you know, change cognition or yeah. And so I wonder, you know, this also aligns with Sarkis you were mentioning of bins. Like I wonder if there are at a physiological level only um, you know, bins or discrete numbers of um of messages that are um being sent.",

            "transcript": "You know, I I I could imagine for if you think about the the multiple ways that the gut and the brain communicate through for the Vegas, you know, I would imagine that there's a limited there's a finite number, I don't know what that is, but of of physiological responses. And maybe for the immune system as well, right? There's going to be certain functions, you know, that can be transferred and maybe we can understand what the what that what the array is. But then when you talk about small molecules, right? You know, I think that that path it's going to be harder to you know, to understand what is that what is a repertoire of of you know, physiological responses. I I agree with you. I mean that that to me is the next like the next step, right? I mean, you know, because ultimately something activates that physiological response, right? And and and then maybe putting this together is that, you know, the the chemical and this is intuitive, but the the chemical um the destination of particular chemicals from my doesn't have to be the brain, right? In fact, it's probably hard to get it, but it could be an enteric neuron or or some other cell in the gut that then once you've, you know, sort of, you know, you're on the on ramp to the freeway and and and you can, you know, access that, you know, these these connections then the host does the rest, right? And so thinking about it's a combination of the two, right? So what's the chemical repertoire and what are the physiological repertoires, but those can be, you know, at at some point a chem there's a chemical initiation to the physiological response and then that can then go up to the brain either directly or indirectly.",

Um and then Elaine discovered many years ago molecule that we now know enters the brain of mice for sulfate, which is derived from tyrosine. Um and it's produced in the gut. And and so certainly the the molecules can get everywhere, but I think the point is that I think maybe this is the takeaway is that they don't have to get to their their their, you know, target or or their organ that they're going to ultimately affect.",

I'm not sure that that that brain uh that that population of of metabolites in the brain is what's mediating a behavioral effect, right? Just because it's in the brain doesn't mean that that's until we like identify receptor and knock it out in a particular brain cell, if that's even how it works. Um and you can show that yes, brain localization of metabolite um I'm just using the brain as one example, right? of of an organ, but that that that's the yeah, that mediates the effect versus the fact that again, in this one isolated case that that we know a little bit about, you know, the percentage of the molecule that gets in the brain is a fraction of what's circulating in the body, right?",
