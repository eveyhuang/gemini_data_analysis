Um and the idea was at least initially that it was chemicals released from the brain in response to stress, presumably anxiety with the similar yet different mechanisms, but that that would cause increased ion transport, it would affect the the transporters on the epithelial cells, cause water efflux into the gut uh and then impact the tight junctions and that this was transient. So it was temporary for an acute stress and it was more permanent with the chronic stress. Um and things like corticosterone increase rapidly with the stressor and then they kind of flat line. So if you're going to do chronic stress, you'll still get activation but it's much lower and then that's associated with immune responses, um inflammation, damage, all those things. So there's and then that is associated with a dysbiosis. So acute responses to stress or anxiety are not associated with immuno immune activation and and microbiome changes. Those are more chronic. Um we studied most of those using using chambers and things like that. I don't know if that really answers the question but",

And we were doing it for trying to get navy personnel to recognize when they were under stress so that they could have some control over their next behavioral move. So by helping them identify what was happening in their thinking and connect it to what physiologically was happening, did their mouth get dry, did their heart start to race, did their stomach cramp up. So all of this physiological scanning, we were trying to train 18 year olds to do this on their own so that they could see how their thinking and their body response were connected. And then they could make an informed decision knowing that they were experiencing some kind of stress. So it was very much an observation and",

But there's another theory where the physiological response starts and then we try to attribute what it is in our environment that is causing that response. Um, and it's likely bidirectional, I think, depending on, you know, depending on if there's like a mood disorder, let's say where there's a constant feedback loop where sometimes people are kind of unaware of their physiologi or their kind of um emotional or thought processes and therefore detect kind of the physiological response first and and vice versa.",
