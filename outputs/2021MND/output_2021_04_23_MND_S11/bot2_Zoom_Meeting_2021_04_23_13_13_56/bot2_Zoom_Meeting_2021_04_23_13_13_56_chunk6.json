And what are just like some responses that need to happen really fast versus other responses that are slow. Maybe the immune, especially if it includes adaptive, would be the slowest right now.

The the response. So for example, let's say a person, you know, is going you know, having problems at work or something, right? They're more sensitized to now worry about picking up their kid at the right time. But it's it's not, you know, that something happened that's, you know, chronically affecting the person and then it raises their threshold to for that acute response.

So something like primary emotions, like fear, anxiety, those might be driven more by neural connections, whereas cognition, which takes a little bit longer, you know, long-term potentiation and the hippocampus and between neurons, that may be kind of a slower process through other mechanisms and likely interactions, you know, with chronic stress that we know that that can impact cognition.

Um talked a little bit about um the bottleneck about detection versus identification of um metabolites, small molecules, uh issues about abundance, small amounts may have a big impact. and the limitation of chemical libraries.
