I was just um, so experiments that JP was talking about, um, so it wasn't with human, it wasn't with humans, it was actually with aged animals where they did this um, uh, kind of symbiotic approach where they, they um, they fuse two animals, a young animal and an aged animal together. Um, and saw that it was in fact the humoral components um, in the blood that influence microglia from, from, from aged animals. But the problem with that is, right, it could be not just the whatever's in the blood, cytokines, etcetera, it could be the fact that it's, you know, in aging the there's leakiness of the gut as well. So, um, so I think that's a really cool idea. That's that's what I wanted to say, JP. I think that's a great idea to do with humans. So. Should I, should I share my screen so you guys can see what I'm saying so you can help me out with this because I'm",

So I've often looked at uh genetic predisposition just waiting on some type of inflammatory response to kick it off. Is that uh what do you think about that? Is there more to it?",
