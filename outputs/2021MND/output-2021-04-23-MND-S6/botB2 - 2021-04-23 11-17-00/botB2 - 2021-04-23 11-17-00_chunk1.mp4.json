And ever since then I got the idea I've I've been in a really rich environment to pursue this, uh, at Baylor and the Texas Medical Center. I'm not sure I could have done what I've done at other schools, but I've I've been ever since I've just indulged in this gut brain axis and it's been exciting.",

I'm interested in understanding how the nervous system gets wired up in the beginning. Um, and until a very few years ago, what developmental biologists knew was it's mom's genes and then it's your genes, at least when you're talking about vertebrates. And now we suddenly know that there are all these other associated microbes with many, many more genes that are influencing the process from very early stages of development. And, uh, you know, it's it's cast a whole new light on the developmental process, and I'm someone who believes that the developmental process sets the organism up for the kinds of things that are going to happen later, such as the kinds of things that that, uh, Bob has talked about. And so we're, uh, in my lab also interested in interactions between the microbiome and other tissues, um, uh, and the nervous system. So in the gut, we look a lot at immune cells in the gut, and in the brain, we look at microglia, which are the resident immune cells in the brain. I don't know the best way for people to introduce themselves because we probably all have, uh, each other in different places on our screens. So people could volunteer, and if they don't, uh, maybe we'll start calling on them.",

We try to understand the molecular basis of mitochondrial quality control, uh, in the course of neurodegeneration in neuronal cells and glial cells. And we also develop therapeutics targeting mitochondria. Uh, we use, uh, the all kinds of therapeutic approach targeting mitochondria to, uh, to see if this is a, uh, the useful target for, uh, preventing the course of neurodegeneration. Uh, recently, we started to look at the the role of mitochondria in the, uh, gut and the brain access, especially in the context of Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease. We try to understand, uh, we want to test the hypothesis that if mitochondria in the gut system could actually serve as like ancient bacteria and they communicate with the immune system, which actually released the factors and, uh, the message to the brain and and also trigger we to trigger the neuroinflammation in brain. Uh, this is our hypothesis. We also start to look build up the model system to work on this, uh, big questions. Yeah.",

And so hoping to identify potential neurogenic factors that are derived from the gut microbiome to promote recovery after these injuries.",
