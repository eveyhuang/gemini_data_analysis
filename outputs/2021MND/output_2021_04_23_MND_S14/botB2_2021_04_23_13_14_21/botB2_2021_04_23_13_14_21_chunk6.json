And so timing gives you maybe some candidates for what that would be, right? Because you're right. I mean if it for example, if it is a brain to gut signal, or I guess it works back to right, right? Uh you know, if it's very rapid, I agree, it's probably neuronal, right?",

The response. So for example, let's say a person, you know, is going, you know, having problems at work or something, right? They're more sensitized to now worry about picking up their kid at the right time. But it's it's not, you know, that something happened that's, you know, chronically affecting the person and then it raises their threshold to for that acute response.",

So something like primary emotions, like fear, anxiety, those might be driven more by neural connections, whereas cognition, which takes a little bit longer, you know, long-term potentiation and the hippocampus and between neurons, that may be kind of a slower process through other mechanisms and likely interactions, you know, with chronic stress that we know that that can impact cognition. So that might be bringing in different mechanisms aside from the initial neural ones.",

I don't know what what people's thoughts are on on what, you know, what can we how can we intervene essentially is is the I think the heart of the question in the gut brain connection.
