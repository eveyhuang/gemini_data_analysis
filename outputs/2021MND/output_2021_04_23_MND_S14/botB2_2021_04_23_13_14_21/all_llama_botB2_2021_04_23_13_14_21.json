Because you know, microbiome is producing has a metabolic capacity of the liver, right? It produces just so many molecules, not all of them are going to be relevant in a particular context. So again maybe it's the way you set up your experiment that you already have a an output of interest in one group of humans or one group of mice and not another and so you can do sort of combinatorial or use combinatorial approaches, but there were improved ways of saying, you know, in addition measuring molecules, like I believe these molecules are the ones that are most bioactive.

And maybe for the immune system as well, right? There's going to be certain functions, you know, that can be transferred and maybe we can understand what the what that what the array is. And then when you talk about small molecules, right? You know, I think that that path it's going to be harder to you know, to understand what is that what is a repertoire of of you know, physiological responses. I I agree with you. I mean that that to me is the next like the next step, right? I mean, you know, because ultimately something activates that physiological response, right? And and and then maybe putting this together is that, you know, the the chemical and this is intuitive, but the the chemical um the destination of particular chemicals, for example, doesn't have to be the brain, right? In fact, it's probably hard to get it, but it could be an enteric neuron or or some other cell in the gut that then once you've, you know, sort of you know, you're on the on ramp to the freeway and and and you can, you know, access that, you know, these these connections then the host does the reps, right? And so thinking about it's a combination of the two, right? So what's the chemical repertoire and what are the physiological repertoires, but those can be, you know, at some point there's a chemical there's a chemical initiation to the physiological response and then that can then go up to the brain either directly or indirectly.

Um, but something's also going on in in in the intestines because you can measure measure diarrhea, right? Or at least bloating and and and abdominal pain.

Um, and the idea was at least initially that it was chemicals released from the brain in response to stress, presumably anxiety would be similar yet different mechanisms, but that that would cause increased ion transport, it would affect the the transporters on the epithelial cells cause water influx into the gut. Uh and then impact the tight junctions and that this was transient. So it was temporary for an acute stress and it was more permanent with a chronic stress. Um, and things like corticosterone increase rapidly with the stressor and then they kind of flat line. So if you're going to do chronic stress, you'll still get activation but it's much slower and then that's associated with immune responses, um inflammation, damage, all those things. So there's and then that is associated with a dysbiosis. So acute responses to stress or anxiety are not associated with immuno immune activation and and microbiome changes. Those are more chronic. Um, but we studied most of those using using chambers and things like that. I don't know if that really answers the question, but",
