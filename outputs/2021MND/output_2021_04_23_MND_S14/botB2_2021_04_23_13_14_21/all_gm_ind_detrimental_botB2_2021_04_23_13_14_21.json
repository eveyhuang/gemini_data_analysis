So again maybe it's the way you set up your experiment that you already have a an output of interest in one group of humans or one group of mice and not another and so you can do sort of combinatorial or use combinatorial approaches, but there were improved ways of saying, you know, in addition measuring molecules, like I believe these molecules are the ones that are most bioactive. Then at least it constrains that that chemical space, right?

And maybe for the immune system as well, right? There's going to be certain functions, you know, that can be transferred and maybe we can understand what the what that what the array is. And then when you talk about small molecules, right? You know, I think that that path it's going to be harder to you know, to understand what is that what is a repertoire of of you know, physiological responses. I I agree with you. I mean that that to me is the next like the next step, right? I mean, you know, because ultimately something activates that physiological response, right? And and and then maybe putting this together is that, you know, the the chemical and this is intuitive, but the the chemical um the destination of particular chemicals, for example, doesn't have to be the brain, right? In fact, it's probably hard to get it, but it could be an enteric neuron or or some other cell in the gut that then once you've, you know, sort of you know, you're on the on ramp to the freeway and and and you can, you know, access that, you know, these these connections then the host does the reps, right? And so thinking about it's a combination of the two, right?
