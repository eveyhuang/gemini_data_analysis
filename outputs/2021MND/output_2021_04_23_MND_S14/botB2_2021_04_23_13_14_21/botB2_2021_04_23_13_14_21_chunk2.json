And maybe for the immune system as well, right? There's going to be certain functions, you know, that can be transferred and maybe we can understand what the what that what the array is. And then when you talk about small molecules, right? You know, I think that that path it's going to be harder to you know, to understand what is that what is a repertoire of of you know, physiological responses. I I agree with you. I mean that that to me is the next like the next step, right? I mean, you know, because ultimately something activates that physiological response, right? And and and then maybe putting this together is that, you know, the the chemical and this is intuitive, but the the chemical um the destination of particular chemicals, for example, doesn't have to be the brain, right? In fact, it's probably hard to get it, but it could be an enteric neuron or or some other cell in the gut that then once you've, you know, sort of you know, you're on the on ramp to the freeway and and and you can, you know, access that, you know, these these connections then the host does the reps, right? And so thinking about it's a combination of the two, right? So what's the chemical repertoire and what are the physiological repertoires, but those can be, you know, at some point there's a chemical there's a chemical initiation to the physiological response and then that can then go up to the brain either directly or indirectly.

            "transcript": "I'm not sure if I have a really good answer to this, but I feel like, you know, um at least my view from the microbiome field is that there's a certain like top molecules that always keep coming up as microbially modulated or microbially derived that you can detect in the host. And many of them don't have assigned kind of physiological function. So they're kind of mysterious molecules that still have to be studied and so you don't really find much in terms of receptors that they act on or whether they diffuse into the cell and act that way. And so those are more difficult um to study.",
