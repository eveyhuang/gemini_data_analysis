So again maybe it's the way you set up your experiment that you already have a an output of interest in one group of humans or one group of mice and not another and so you can do sort of combinatorial or use combinatorial approaches, but there were improved ways of saying, you know, in addition measuring molecules, like I believe these molecules are the ones that are most bioactive. Then at least it constrains that that chemical space, right?

And and and then maybe putting this together is that, you know, the the chemical and this is intuitive, but the the chemical um the destination of particular chemicals, for example, doesn't have to be the brain, right?

Um, and the idea was at least initially that it was chemicals released from the brain in response to stress, presumably anxiety would be similar yet different mechanisms, but that that would cause increased ion transport, it would affect the the transporters on the epithelial cells cause water influx into the gut. Uh and then impact the tight junctions and that this was transient. So it was temporary for an acute stress and it was more permanent with a chronic stress. Um, and things like corticosterone increase rapidly with the stressor and then they kind of flat line. So if you're going to do chronic stress, you'll still get activation but it's much slower and then that's associated with immune responses, um inflammation, damage, all those things. So there's and then that is associated with a dysbiosis. So acute responses to stress or anxiety are not associated with immuno immune activation and and microbiome changes. Those are more chronic. Um, but we studied most of those using using chambers and things like that. I don't know if that really answers the question, but",
