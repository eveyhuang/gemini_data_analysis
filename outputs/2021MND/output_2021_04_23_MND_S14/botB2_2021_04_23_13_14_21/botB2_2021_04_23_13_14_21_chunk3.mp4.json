So you can now deliver threads and stimulate, you know, through light or through chemicals. Yeah. And then look at the rest of have those been and that would be the great, right? Again, you know, there would be maybe specific context where we know what brain region other, you know, I think most cases we may not, right? But have people done that, right?
