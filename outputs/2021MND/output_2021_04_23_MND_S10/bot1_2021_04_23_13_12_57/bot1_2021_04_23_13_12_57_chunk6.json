Um, C13 labeling, like I think it was Elizabeth was saying it's really easy if you know what candidate you're looking at, you can make a C13 label and then you can follow that in the gut, in the tissues all the way up to the brain if that's what you're interested in. But if you don't want to provide an exogenous signal, how do you get how do you have that same tracking capability? And so there was this discussion of genetically tractable microbes, either under or over expressing something or using these privileged substrates and whether or not we can I think the the idea was labeling the substrate and then following that through the bug and then through the host, is that right?",

Um, so even if you measure that there's a difference, say between again like a healthy versus a disease state, what is the impact of that? So you know you have a difference, but is the disease state say if it's got a reduced level of short chain fatty acids in the circulation, is that still saturation for that that person? Um, and is there a way that we can overcome that uh or would the way that we deliver said drug, if it's a short chain fatty acid for example, if we just feed that into the diet versus uh changing the microbiota so that we increase short chain fatty acid capability from the from the microbiota itself, does does that have an effect on the pharmacodynamics of the drug's ability or access to a different tissue site. Um, and then finally, this conversation about metal ions, there's a lot that sort of was happening while I was trying to get these notes um together, but it sounded like ultimately really there are indications that the microbiota has something to do with uh heavy metal metabolism. There's a lot that we don't understand and technically we don't we don't understand it because there are so many technical challenges just in terms of measurement, reporting across studies and one thing that could really advance the field here would be sensors for metal content and species uh in vivo in real time and then within that looking for whether or not these heavy metals are acting as electron acceptors or versus enzyme cofactors. How do we feel about this?",

Um, and it's kind of very indirect. They are um associated with neurological diseases. Um, but they're not necessarily associated with the microbiome, but it's at least another thought of maybe we don't even need to understand really what's going on and really just use the microbiome as an agent through which we could engineer the metabolome of the host provided these molecules are, you know, going through inter circulation and that's something.",

Um, that uh from Warren Stevens group uh where they uh gave mice antibiotics and they see differences in redox potential. Um, and it would be uh interesting to see like how does that actually change ironciation as a consequence of of antibiotics as well and what sort of readouts does this end up um or impacts does this end up having on the the activity of them bacteria just because now as I think you had mentioned or um I mean was Jay like uh umphores, like now maybe that we have iron three bacteria producing morephores.
