There's some beautiful studies that show like the tracking of you know, like pharmacokinetics of drugs, um which we leverage a lot um uh in our lab like going back to use those. When you think about the molecules that are produced endogenously, it does get really tricky to me to think about well even if it's getting produced, where does it go from there? Is it going between cells? Like is it crosses the epithelium is it going through a cell, which could matter in terms of we think a lot about oxidation state. If it goes through a cell, this could change like oxidation state as opposed to between cell. And uh this is something we've struggled with in the lab like thinking about how do you actually track those specific molecules that are getting produced where it's more obvious if it's an exogenous source that you're providing like a carbon, we can use C13 labels too, but how do you do that in vivo um and follow where it goes? And I don't I I I love if someone can answer that or like ideas for how people think about that.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, sorry. I apologize. I've had to do two days, you know what it's like, you know, patients come first every day. Um Um yeah, I'm I'm a developmental fellow um who's just offered an assistant professor position at the University of Calgary. So I'm sort of like in the very, very early stages. Um my plan is to use precision medicine approaches to approach neurodevelopmental conditions to try to understand them better, but my PhD work was in the neuroscience of the gut, which has sort of brought me back around to this question of um, you know, sort of microbiome and neurodevelopmental conditions. I have to be honest with you for most other sessions I've felt I've been able to follow and it's probably because I came a little late, but um sort of the level of the scientific discussion has been a bit above me, which is in part why I haven't jumped in yet. So it's been part of what I've really enjoyed about the is that I truly have learned so much and like my day-to-day I think looks very different from a lot of you. So um I don't have anything to add quite yet other than to say like you guys are so smart.",
