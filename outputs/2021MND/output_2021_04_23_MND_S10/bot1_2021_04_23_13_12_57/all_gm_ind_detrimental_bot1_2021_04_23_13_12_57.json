There's some beautiful studies that show like the tracking of you know, like pharmacokinetics of drugs, um which we leverage a lot um uh in our lab like going back to use those. When you think about the molecules that are produced endogenously, it does get really tricky to me to think about well even if it's getting produced, where does it go from there? Is it going between cells? Like is it crosses the epithelium is it going through a cell, which could matter in terms of we think a lot about oxidation state. If it goes through a cell, this could change like oxidation state as opposed to between cell. And uh this is something we've struggled with in the lab like thinking about how do you actually track those specific molecules that are getting produced where it's more obvious if it's an exogenous source that you're providing like a carbon, we can use C13 labels too, but how do you do that in vivo um and follow where it goes?

So like if you have a redox potential measured in one study, it's probably reasonable to be consistent within a study, but across studies, the numbers that they change by like or like orders of magnitude of 10 or 100, um, that are, um, that are dramatic. And one of the things that, um, I'm interested in if anyone has comments on this is, um, how can we measure metal ions better in the gut and in real time?

But if you don't want to provide an exogenous signal, how do you get how do you have that same tracking capability?

Um, and is there a way that we can overcome that uh or would the way that we deliver said drug, if it's a short chain fatty acid for example, if we just feed that into the diet versus uh changing the microbiota so that we increase short chain fatty acid capability from the from the microbiota itself, does does that have an effect on the pharmacodynamics of the drug's ability or access to a different tissue site. Um, and then finally, this conversation about metal ions, there's a lot that sort of was happening while I was trying to get these notes um together, but it sounded like ultimately really there are indications that the microbiota has something to do with uh heavy metal metabolism. There's a lot that we don't understand and technically we don't we don't understand it because there are so many technical challenges just in terms of measurement, reporting across studies and one thing that could really advance the field here would be sensors for metal content and species uh in vivo in real time and then within that looking for whether or not these heavy metals are acting as electron acceptors or versus enzyme cofactors.

And there's another one based in Boston uh called Synlogic. Um these are all in like phase two trials, all orally dosed. I know some folks that worked at Synlogic and their clinical trial was giving people a half a liter of bacterial culture at a concentration of like 10 to the 11 CFU per mill. And that was approved by the FDA. So it's like really high dosing of bugs going into people um and they've had good phase two results I think or phase 1A phase 1B sorry, phase two results and they're moving forward from there. So",
