That would be, uh, very unusual. But like, you know, the same a similar composition might give you totally different phenotypes in a in two hosts, right? And so like maybe there are metabolomic ways of, uh, of doing precision medicine that that where key metabolites are measured and you can say, okay, well, you know, if this person has a lot of build up of X, you know, it means that means something about metabolism of whatever drug of the of the line.

Um, that is, uh, when, um, there have been studies about redox potential in microbial communities for decades, but there's also a huge body of literature that talks about how hard it is to have reproducibility across experiments. So like if you have a redox potential measured in one study, it's probably reasonable to be consistent within a study, but across studies, the numbers that they change by like or like orders of magnitude of 10 or 100, um, that are, um, that are dramatic. And one of the things that, um, I'm interested in if anyone has comments on this is, um, how can we measure metal ions better in the gut and in real time?
