I mean is it does diarrhea does anxiety start in the gut, does it start in the brain? I don't know if it starts anywhere, but I mean are there particular maybe that that's that's you know, I bring that up and there's others, right? Like IBS and and others where you have a a behavioral response coupled with a GI response, right? Maybe those are systems that are primed to really try and understand the directionality of that signal, how those two, you know, locations, right? Not just tissues, you know, are are communicating with each other because at least in, you know, at face value both seem to be affected, right? I would imagine, you know, any sort of depression or anxiety is something's going on in the brain, whether or not it starts in the brain we can debate that, right? Um, but something's also going on in in in the intestines because you can measure measure diarrhea, right? Or at least bloating and and and abdominal pain. And so I just wonder if if if, you know, people know, you know, is is there any evidence of of directionality in those systems?",

Um, and the idea was at least initially that it was chemicals released from the brain in response to stress, presumably anxiety would be similar yet different mechanisms, but that that would cause increased ion transport, it would affect the the transporters on the epithelial cells cause water influx into the gut. Uh and then impact the tight junctions and that this was transient. So it was temporary for an acute stress and it was more permanent with a chronic stress. Um, and things like corticosterone increase rapidly with the stressor and then they kind of flat line. So if you're going to do chronic stress, you'll still get activation but it's much slower and then that's associated with immune responses, um inflammation, damage, all those things. So there's and then that is associated with a dysbiosis. So acute responses to stress or anxiety are not associated with immuno immune activation and and microbiome changes. Those are more chronic. Um, but we studied most of those using using chambers and things like that. I don't know if that really answers the question, but",
