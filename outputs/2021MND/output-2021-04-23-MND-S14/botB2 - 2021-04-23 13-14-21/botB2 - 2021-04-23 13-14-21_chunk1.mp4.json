I think all have been to some degree, you know, studied, right? Uh I don't know if there are other thoughts or um or what is, you know, are there specific types of communication that may in particular context be more important than others and and to what degree do we understand, you know, which mechanism is at play in a particular context. I don't know if people have thoughts on on, you know, you know, just the level of understanding we have so far.",

This is not exactly my field, but one of the general perceptions that I have is that although there are quite a bit of surveys, um, and exploratory studies on on the metabolism and the different metabolites. Um, that can interact with with the host, there's still not a ton known as to what which specific microbes or micro groups produce them and and and that would be to me would be really important to then know how the microbiome can be modulated in order to change uh the metabolic output for metabolites of host health importance.",

So when we talk about messages, are we talking about the physical um molecule that is propagating through different um systems or are we also refer to the response um or the response between these different system? Because I feel um I mean again when whenever we get into this kind of discussion, I feel it's probably um relevant to to define the message first.",

So so you know, the comment it just understand correctly is is to define that repertoire as an initial step so that we know at least what the players are and then that can inform potential responses, right? Now I know people are doing that um and people have been doing that for for some time. I think that there's always more to learn. Um, I think some of this literature goes back even a decade or more. Um, and I think a lot of this is based on small molecule detection, right? Um, but people like Jeremy Nicholson even more than a decade ago were measuring molecular outputs from the microbiome in mouse and rat models and and some human systems as well. My understanding and and you know, Kai and I think others may know more is, you know, that one of the bottlenecks um is detection, right? And identification of small molecules. We generally, you know, I know mass spec technology and other technologies are improving quite rapidly.",

So like you're asking because like mass spec is great for getting, you know, a big picture look at all the different molecules there in the tissue. Where's like I'm a sensors person. So I'm like really good at measuring one or two things but really fast temporal resolution in live tissue. So it depends on the the question you're trying to I guess ask. So I mean, and I think both are important. Um, so I guess when you're defining the messengers, it's like do you want to look at it like a snapshot in time of like all the different messengers that are um present?",

So we're we're looking at single molecule emission. So back then we were assuming all the molecule will behave the same way, but then turns out there will be a small subpopulation of molecule are doing the the the heavy lifting work, but then they were not abundant in the population. So I was curious whether there's also molecules like this in the subpopulation, they don't concentration wise they don't account for too much, but then they're doing for most important thing.",

So in addition, I'm not even sure off the top of my head other than the way an experiment set up I'm not sure how this would happen, but you know, define the chemical repertoire but somehow binning them in in a way where there's at least some initial insight as to what molecules may be bioactive, right? Because you know, microbiome is producing has a metabolic capacity of the liver, right? It produces just so many molecules, not all of them are going to be relevant in a particular context. So again maybe it's the way you set up your experiment that you already have a an output of interest in one group of humans or one group of mice and not another and so you can do sort of combinatorial or use combinatorial approaches, but there were improved ways of saying, you know, in addition measuring molecules, like I believe these molecules are the ones that are most bioactive. Then at least it constrains that that chemical space, right? And and allows you to, you know, potentially get at the the ones that are that are mediating an effect. and I I just don't know how off top of my head I just don't know what those systems would look like.",

But I was also thinking at a higher level, what is the diversity of kind of physiological and functional messages that are passing back and forth between the brain um between the gut and the brain.
