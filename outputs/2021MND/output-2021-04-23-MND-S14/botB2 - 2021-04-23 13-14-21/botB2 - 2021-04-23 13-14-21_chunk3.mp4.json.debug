So um one example is we've done some work on serotonin and so some microbes can make serotonin de novo and then also microbes can stimulate the host to make serotonin. And that could, you know, that gets into the bloodstream and it could either diffuse, you know, and you know, go to other organ systems or it even could act locally on vagal neurons, which all have serotonin receptors. And so I think it's just complicated by the fact that all of these pathways are co-occurring at the same time that you have neuronal acting going on at the same time as diffusion of serotonin and other serotonin related derivatives um and it's kind of difficult to account for the complexity of these happening in tandem.",
