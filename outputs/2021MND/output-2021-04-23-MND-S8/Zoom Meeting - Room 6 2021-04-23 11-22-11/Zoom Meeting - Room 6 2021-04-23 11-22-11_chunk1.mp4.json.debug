Um, they restore some of the characteristic defects that you see in a germ free animal. So every single one of them has the ability to induce host education, uh immune education, uh homeostasis. So putting them together, like you're just going to hit different parts of whatever immune profile you're you're supposed to be fixing. Um, and then associated with that there's intestinal vascularization, um, and that probably has impacts on gut brain access. So it's a very interesting question of what's right because I don't think anybody knows the answer to that. But each one of them each one of them has a specific niche to fix to sort of educate the immune system and everything that follows downstream of that.",
