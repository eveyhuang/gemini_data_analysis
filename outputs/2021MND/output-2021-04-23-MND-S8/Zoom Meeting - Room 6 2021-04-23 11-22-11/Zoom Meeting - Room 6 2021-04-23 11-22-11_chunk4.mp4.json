I think that um when we're thinking about phenotypes that humans get from the microbiome, it's unlikely that a single player in the microbiome or a single gene or a single metabolite is responsible for the explaining all the variation in the phenotype.",

It in my opinion, I think it comes from the the uh entirety of the system and I have a lot of doubts as to whether that complexity can be derived ground up because it seems like when you put two players in, you get some very specific interactions that may or may not have any bearing on what you get when you have 100 players.",

Much less for bacteria that we um know less about and are harder to observe.",

So like if you went to a lake and you measured the amount of like excess nitrogen, right? You'd probably know if there's like a lot of it that there's going to be like an algal bloom soon and that things are going to collapse. And so like um like um Ida was mentioning earlier too or suggesting like things like redox, right? If like the redox is really off and there's a lot of oxygen in the environment, you don't really have to know the interspecies interactions to know something bad is probably about to happen. And so like um like um Ida was mentioning earlier too or suggesting like things like redox, right? If like the redox is really off and there's a lot of oxygen in the environment, you don't really have to know the interspecies interactions to know something bad is probably about to happen. And so I guess then it comes down to as Carlino's saying on the other part, like what do you, where do you actually have to get the community to go or to actually do? I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm relatively optimistic that on the front end that you could predict somehow or you you um given at least like some environmental parameters what the community is going to do even if you don't know exactly which bugs are going to do it.",

Like you know kind of like the um the the limitation. So like let's say that there's just going to be a certain temperature at which some bacteria are not able to grow. And so if you know that you're at that temperature, you don't have to worry about those species. So like that predictability becomes absolute in that case. Or like in the case of like what we're studying in in our lab, like if you put in an a laxative and this laxative increases the osmolarity, we just know there are some species that will undergo extinction because they can't handle the that those parameters.",

So it's it's kind of we consider them implicitly, they will affect the interspecies interactions. But since we don't have a a direct measurement of those host response, so we cannot model them directly. That's what I mean. Also, oh, go ahead. I was going to say uh one thing that my PhD advisor always told us was never be constrained by the data available to you. Always go and find the question you care about and then find the data. And if it doesn't exist, then generate it. So if you think it's a good idea, you can maybe propose to Silog to generate that data. Right.",

But I think whatever your question is allows you to draw the bounds of what what you're what you're including. Um but for a simple example of how the host shapes the environment that the microbes are in, when you introduce a helminth that changes the epithelial mucus production and that's going to have an effect on the physical environment and so how close microbes can get to epithelial cells. And just by changing the glycobiology of the mucus, it changes which microbes can then compete. So it's the host response, not even talking about inflammation, but it's changing the physical environment that those microbes are now interacting in. So I think with all of this, like and I said this in the session that we were in yesterday, these are all really big questions. So whatever we're doing, we're there's going to be a specific question that your research interest is guiding towards and that's going to change or that's going to affect your ideal approach to answering said question. And I think we all have to have like a very agnostic view of this is the the question, this is the approach that they took and now we all have a responsibility to try and synthesize that to give us some information on interspecies interactions and then how that's going to affect gut brain.",
