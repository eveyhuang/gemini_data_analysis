Um and back to sorry, Caroline can probably speak a little bit more to this, but when you change bacterial composition, you're also going to see changes in phage composition. And some of that is going to be predator prey relationships, some of that is going to just be the loss of the bacteria that happen. So there are sort of bits and pieces that we know, but like a systematic understanding, I think, is still to be defined.",

I assume it's just the population goes up. Is that so or no? It's more detail like we know biochemical markers that they also change in addition to growth.",

Just general, like there's more space, so they have more nutrients, so they're not competing against the bacteria, therefore they can take off. Just a very sort of simplistic, like this is probably what's happening. Um but no real systematic test for that. We have a project sort of developing in the lab where we're trying to get a much more detailed understanding of what happens when we have a helminth and a specific bacteria and what the dynamics between the helminth and the bacteria do in the host and whether or not it's immune mediated. But I'm happy to let other people chime in on their understanding of this.",

            "transcript": "As a physicist, I think the um the interspecies interactions can be due to many different mechanism. For example, um a bacteria A can secrete some bacteri that kill bacteria B, right? This is there are many evidence. And also the different species might um compete with with uh for the same type of nutrients or they do cross-feeding, right? The metabolic product of one species will feed the other species or the interaction can be modeled by the host immune system. So uh from the modeling perspective, we consider all different kind of mechanism jointly determining the interaction strength and the sign of one species on another species. And if you are lucky and if you study bacteria that can be really cultured in vitro, then of course you can use the textbook technique, right? through the monoculture and co-culture and then you calculate the relative view. And this will give you very um convincing result regarding the interspecies interactions. But in many cases, those bacteria cannot be cultured. So we have to infer the interactions based on uh experimental data. So and they are my understanding that there are two different approach. You can either rely on high quality time series data. But the caveat is that the time series data should be really informative enough. But what do you what do I mean by informative enough? How informative is informative? Okay, in system identification or control theory, actually there's a well-defined mathematical criterion to define this kind of informativeness. It's called persistent excitation. In a sense that the signal or the time series has to be basically crazy enough. So you can calculate the eigen value of the time series and eigen value should be um much larger than zero. And in reality, you know, at least for human gut microbiome, we know that for healthy adults, if you don't change your diet drastically, if you don't take too much antibiotics, our microbiome is so stable and the temporal fluctuation doesn't mean any real ecological dynamics. It's kind of just reflecting that um our slight vibe change. So um so in that sense, the temporal data you observe from like human gut microbiome is not informative enough for us to infer the interspecies interactions. Even if you convince someone to do the sample collection on a daily basis for one year, the data still is not informative enough. And we have we have shown very clear evidence that this will not work. And the idea is very simple. If you just shuffle the time series, you largely destroy the temporal structure and use standard system identification method to infer the interaction, you will get very similar interactions. What does this mean? This just means the real time series is just like a random shuffle time series. Okay? So that's one approach. As long as you have very informative time series data, you can rely on very standard system identification technique to infer the interspecies interaction. But if you don't have time series data, you can still rely on cross-section data. As long as you see on the cross-section data roughly represent the statistic samples of the complex ecosystem and we have developed method to infer the interspecies interactions from cross-section data. And the basic idea is that as long as you have two statistic samples, as long as they have uh one common species, then the difference between the two statistics somehow encode the interspecies interactions. So in this case, as long as you collect enough statistic samples, then we can basically infer the interspecies interactions. The only caveat is that we need absolute abundance. Relative abundance will not work. The compositionality issue is really a big challenge in this interspecies interaction inference. So that's my understanding about this this topic. We we don't uh we do have methods, but we don't have very high quality data either time series data or cross-sectional data.",

And I feel like this is a really big question in the field about is it the function that matters about the microbiota? So if you add a helminth and are you providing a new member to the microbiota or are you providing new functionality? And same thing with adding, say, a community that doesn't have viruses and you add viruses in, like does it affect just the dynamics of the bacteria or does it matter to the host because there's viruses specifically? And I think that's kind of an interesting way of thinking about the different levels, too.",

How does it affect gut brain communication? And those are the main two things that we've talked about as well as a little bit about how we measure things. And so some mostly questions have come up rather than answers to these. That's good. And so some of the questions are like, how do we actually study them? Like this depends on the model approach and the sequencing depth as well as extraction approach. One of the questions that came up initially was like, what does it even mean to have homeostasis? And so there was this question about population sizes, what are the actual interactions that happen between these different organisms? Are they direct, indirect? Do they happen through the immune system? And then the question then became thinking about how is this actually important for homeostasis and um what are the time scales of homeostasis, for example.
