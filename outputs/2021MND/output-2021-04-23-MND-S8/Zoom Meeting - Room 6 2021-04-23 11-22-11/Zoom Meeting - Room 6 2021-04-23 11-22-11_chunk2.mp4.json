Um and bacteria sorry, Carolina can probably speak a little bit more to this, but when you change bacterial composition, you're also going to see changes in phage composition. And some of that is going to be predator prey relationships, some of that is going to just be the loss of the bacteria that that happen. So there are sort of bits and pieces that we know, but like a systematic understanding I think is still to be defined.",

Just general like there's more space. So they have more nutrients. So they're not competing against the bacteria, therefore they can take off. Just a very sort of simplistic like this is probably what's happening. Um, but no real systematic test for that. We have a process a project sort of developing in the lab where we're trying to get a much more detailed understanding of what happens when we have a helmet and a specific bacteria and what the dynamics between the helmet and the bacteria do in the host and whether or not it's immune mediated, but I'm happy to let other people chime in on their uh understanding at this.",

            "transcript": "Okay, is that is that physics? I think the um the inter species interactions can be due to many different mechanisms. For example, um bacteria A can secrete some bacteriosin that kill bacteria B, right? This is there are many evidence. And also the different species might um compete with it with uh for the same type of nutrients or the they do cross feeding, right? the metabolic product of one species will feed the other species. Or the the interaction can be modulated by the host immune system. So uh from the modeling perspective, we consider all different kind of mechanism jointly determining the interaction strength and the sign of one species on another species. And uh if you are lucky and if you study a bacteria that can be really cultured in vitro, then of course you can use the textbook technique, right? You do the monoculture and coculture and then you calculate the relative yield and this will give you very um convincing result regarding the inter species interactions. But in many cases those bacteria cannot be cultured. So we have to infer the interactions based on uh experimental data. So and we are my understanding is that there are two different approach. You can either rely on high quality time series data.",

Okay, in system uh identification or control theory, actually there is a well defined mathematic criterion to to define this kind of uh uh informativeness is called persistent excitation. In a sense that the the signal or the time series has to be basically crazy enough. So you can calculate the uh the eigen value of the time series and the eigen value should be uh much larger than zero. And uh in reality, you know, at least for human gut microbiome, we know that for healthy adults, if you don't change your diet drastically, if you don't take too much antibiotics, our microbiome is so stable and the temporal uh fluctuation doesn't mean any real ecological dynamics. It's kind of just reflecting that um our uh slight diet change.",

And uh we have we have shown very clear evidence that this will not work. And the idea is very simple. If you just shuffle the time series, you largely destroy the temporal structure and you standard system identification method to infer the interaction, you will get very similar uh interactions. What does this mean? This just mean the real time series is just like a random uh um random shuffle time series. Okay. So that's one approach. As long as you have very informative time series data, you can rely on very standard system identification technique to infer the inter species interaction. But if you don't have time series data, you can still rely on cross section data. As long as you assume the cross section data roughly represent the static samples of the the complex ecosystem and we have developed method to infer the inter species interactions from cross section data. And the basic idea is that as long as you have two static samples, as long as they have uh one common species, then the difference between the two steady states somehow encode the inter species interactions. So in this case, as long as you collect enough static samples, then we can basically infer the inter species interactions. The only caveat is that we need a super abundance. Radical abundance will not work. The combinationality issue is really a big challenge in this uh inter species interaction inference.",

So you know, if you add a helmet and and you are you providing a new member to the microbiota or are you providing new functionality?
