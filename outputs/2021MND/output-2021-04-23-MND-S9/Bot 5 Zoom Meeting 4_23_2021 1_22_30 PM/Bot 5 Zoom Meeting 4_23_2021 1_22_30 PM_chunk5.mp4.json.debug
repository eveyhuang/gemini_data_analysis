   "transcript": "Yeah, so what what we use to modulate specific cell populations in the central nervous system is to use adeno associated viruses to deliver light activate proteins, uh, the field of optogenetics and there are other perturbation strategies also chemogenetics. Uh, so essentially you have uh you introduce receptors that respond to some kind of physical energy uh that or a chemical compound in some case and you can then manipulate neural excitability and use essentially the gene delivery strategy to achieve specificity in terms of cell types. But I'm not sure to what extent this has been done um in the enteric nervous system. I could definitely imagine the use of these techniques to in animal models obviously to to query kind of the top down control aspect of it. Whether that will I mean it it will probably modulate uh whatever the enteric nervous system is doing and then potentially as a secondary cause modulate the the gut microbiome. I think there are bigger questions about whether we can ever actually uh cut open all these feedback loops, but I I could imagine using such techniques to identify some of the top down electrical control if you will. And perhaps also bottom up by delivering gene delivery to the enteric nervous system and kind of deliver light or whatever energy there uh for the bottom up connections.",

   "transcript": "Yeah, that that actually brings up an interesting point, right? So if we talk about the neural communication, we're talking about, you know, millisecond time scale and to the to the limited extent I understand it, if we talk about changes in the microbiome, we're probably talking time scale of minutes to hours at least. So there's some kind of translation of the coding scheme that must occur across time scales. I haven't really thought about that before, but now you say that, I'm curious how that should actually work because I cannot imagine a one to one code where neural activity is just up fire fire fire for minutes and hours to communicate the change, right? So some I've been thinking about it the other way around, you know, from the like a biologist side like, why would you want to communicate with the brain so quickly, you know, as opposed like a humoral communication that would probably take maybe minutes to longer. Right. And I I think the answer to that is a developmental perspective, right? So the digest the gustatory/ digestive system is kind of the the the essence for survival uh for for for newborns and uh that's the probably the origin of the world the mapping of anxiety and emotional states onto the gut actually derives from and I think our emotional states because they drive us to survival behavior need actually to be in a relatively fast time scale. So that would be the flip side to the coin potentially.",

So there"s some kind of translation of the coding scheme that must occur across time scales. I haven"t really thought about that before, but now you say that, I"m curious how that should actually work because I cannot imagine a one to one code where neural activity is just up fire fire fire for minutes and hours to communicate the change, right? So some I"ve been thinking about it the other way around, you know, from the like a biologist side like, why would you want to communicate with the brain so quickly, you know, as opposed like a humoral communication that would probably take maybe minutes to longer. Right. And I I think the answer to that is a developmental perspective, right? So the digest the gustatory/ digestive system is kind of the the the essence for survival uh for for for newborns and uh that"s the probably the origin of the world the mapping of anxiety and emotional states onto the gut actually derives from and I think our emotional states because they drive us to survival behavior need actually to be in a relatively fast time scale.
