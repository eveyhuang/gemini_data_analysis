            "transcript": "So, we have so we study the molecular interactions at the tight junction level, which is caused by the proteins called claudins. And the blood brain barrier is made up of claudin 5, which is belongs to the family of claudins, but that is unique to the brain. So if you are looking for transport across that, we have studied the extracellular interactions between those claudin molecules and found out the pore sizes and the chemical specificity of the pore to figure out whether a cation, for example, is going to go easy or the anion. Even at the it's very iron selective and size selective. So those are the interactions we are looking at. But if you go to the gut and try to study the same tight junction interaction, that is made up of claudin 23 and claudin 11 and 3, which is very different from the brain. So what can go through the gut epithelial layer is different than what can go in the brain. So if the metabolites are going through, they have to be able to navigate that difference in the tight junctions. And that is just the paracellular aspect of it. The receptors and other things is a completely different story and which metabolite prefer going through the receptor needs to be known in my mind to to understand this this axis.",

Uh and which ones have a receptor, known receptor and which ones don't. So those questions are unanswered and that's what I was trying to steer the conversation towards is are we interested in looking at how this communication happens and through which pathway. Uh and if it's through the blood or not. Because I was also hearing the nerve nerve interactions which I'm not aware of much of it. So that that's also that distinction there, like which is the blood driven one and which is not.",

Um and it seems like there's been, you know, some recent studies on like, you know, looking at traumatic brain injury and and its effects on the microbiome and it seems like there's some inflammatory responses, but I'm not this is not my area, so I'm curious whether people have any thoughts as to what what are the mechanisms associated with this is it through the the vagal nerves um in a bidirectional fashion. And also there's been some past studies on looking at, you know, peripheral nerve stimulation for immune modulation and and I don't think anyone's I'm not aware of any studies looking at how that might affect like, you know, the microbiome and so I wonder if people have any thoughts about that.",

Um and so many brain interventions like thinking about medications that are given to patients with neurological disorders, they also disrupt motility patterns, they you know, lead to constipation or diarrhea. And so how does that then affect the microbiome? Um it could be completely indirect just to overall physiology of the gut.",

And so after at least in mice models when they when they're injured, it's they lose some enteric neurons. And so there's this drastic slowing that happens of of gut motility. But what is interesting is the microbiome then doesn't change until so that slowing happens really early with two to four days and then microbiome composition doesn't shift until two weeks later significantly. Um and then really solidified like four four weeks later. But so so there's definitely that top down effect that's happening to shift the microbiome. But it doesn't necessarily mean then that that new microbiome's composition doesn't then affect the affect the host in some way.",
