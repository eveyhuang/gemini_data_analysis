So if you are looking for transport across that, uh, we have studied it uh the extracellular interactions between those Claudin molecules and found out the pore sizes and the chemical specificity of the pore to figure out whether a cation for example is going to go easy or the anion even at the it\'s very ion selective and size selective. So those are the interactions we\'re looking at. But if you go to the gut and try to study the same tight junction interaction, that is made up of Claudin 23 and Claudin um 11 and three, which is very different from the brain. So what can go through the gut uh epithelial layer is different than what can go in the brain. So if the metabolites are going through, they have to be a be able to navigate that difference in the tight junctions.',
