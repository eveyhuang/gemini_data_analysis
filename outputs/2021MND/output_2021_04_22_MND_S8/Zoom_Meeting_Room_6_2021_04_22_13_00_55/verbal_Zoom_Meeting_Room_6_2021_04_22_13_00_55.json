        "utterance": "Kaixiong Ye: The solution I'm proposing is using genetic data. So there's a method called Mendelian randomization, basically to use genetic variants from human host genetic variants that can control that biomarker and use that as a drug. Like you use that genetic variant, you treat the metabolite and then you see if there's an impact on the disease. So using genetic data, there's a possibility to test the possible causal relationship between one microbial biomarker and the disease. If we think about a bold suggestion is that we have many possible microbial biomarkers. We can use that same approach and then screen through them to find the metabolite that are likely to be causal for a specific disease. Try to prioritize biomarkers for disease. That's what we do recently in the lab for COVID-19. We go across a few thousand traits including biomarkers and identify the ones that are likely to be causal, increasing people's risk for severe COVID-19. I feel that we can apply the same approach to prioritize possible causal biomarkers for specific disease. And then we can flip that idea around. If you have a specific biomarker like butyrate, what kind of disease is butyrate relevant with? We start with butyrate, we can screen through any possible disease and prioritize the one that is likely has a causal relationship with butyrate. Okay, so those are just bold idea I have here throwing back out there for discussion. ",

And I would argue that a biomarker doesn't necessarily have to be directly causally related to the disease that you're studying. It needs to be correlationally related. So it may be difficult to directly measure something like a particular short chain fatty acid, either because it's short lived, like it's produced and then it's taken up and biotransformed and so it's hard to measure certain things in real time. But if you can find another marker, it could be a phenotype, it could be a small molecule, it could be a gene that is directly correlated with that thing that's biologically important, that can be used to help you monitor disease, screen for it, detect it, or as a proxy to measure treatment efficacy, that sort of thing.
