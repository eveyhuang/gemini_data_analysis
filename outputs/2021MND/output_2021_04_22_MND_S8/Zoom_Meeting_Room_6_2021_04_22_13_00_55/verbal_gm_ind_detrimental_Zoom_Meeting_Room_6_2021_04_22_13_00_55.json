Uh so there's a method called Mendelian randomization, basically to use genetic variants uh from from human, host genetic variants that can control that uh biomarker and use that as a as a drug. Like you use that genetic variant, you treat the metabolite and then you see if there's an impact on the disease. So using genetic data, there's a possibility to test the possible causal relationship between one microbial biomarker and the the disease. And you you think about it uh a bold suggestion is that we have many possible microbial micro uh biomarkers. We can use that same approach and then screen through them to find the metabolite that are likely to be causal for a specific disease. Right? Try to prioritize biomarkers for disease. And that's what we do recently in the lab for COVID-19. We go across a few thousand traits including biomarkers and identify the ones that are likely to be causal increasing people's risk for severe COVID-19. And I feel that we can apply the same approach to prioritize possible causal biomarker for a specific disease. And then we can flip that idea around. If you have a specific biomarker like bute, what kind of disease is is bute relevant with? We start with bute, we can screen through any possible disease and prioritize the one that is likely has a causal relationship with uh bute. Okay? So those are the just a bold idea I have here uh throwing back out there for discussion. ",
