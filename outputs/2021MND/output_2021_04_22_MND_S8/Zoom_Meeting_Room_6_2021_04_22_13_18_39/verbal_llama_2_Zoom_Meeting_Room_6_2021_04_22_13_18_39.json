But I think one of the things they were trying to elicit from us was thinking about um early stage biomarkers that um you know predate the onset of a lot of these um kind of follow on effects on physiology which is I think one of the major challenges in in things like Parkinson's disease um where some of the you know some things like prodromal Parkinson's is associated with constipation that would obviously lead to lots of changes in microbial or ripple effects on the microbial community.

And I think that actually makes the problem harder and maybe even further pens you into a space where really the good mark biomarkers and this would be my own bias would be things that may be causal. Um and those would be the things that you would be able to detect actually early before you have the changes in physiology and a lot of the biomarkers that we use that people rely on are the opposite, right?

I must publish last year. It was started over 10 years ago when I was in Toronto. But the gem study um was just published in Gastro last year looking at prospective IBD patients and and siblings. And so they designed this study to identify whether intestinal permeability was a predisposing factor to IBD uh in and so there was all these anecdotal evidences that um people had permeability defects prior to getting IBD and this was a designed specifically to address this and so they had um siblings uh of IBD patients and they looked at stool, they looked at biopsies and all these things and were able to identify permeability as a as a precursor to IBD in a genetically susceptible population. Um and I know that they collected all the stool and they haven't analyzed it yet, but that might be one way to look at biomarkers um for people that over time developed IBD. And so I'm not sure if a similar study could be designed with a specific neurodegenerative disease in mind where there is an genetic or environmental component that can be identified prior to onset. And then following although some of these the the process is a lot longer because the disease develops later in life compared to IBD, but it's just an example of something that was could be designed in order to get biomarkers prior to and then during.

So when I'm thinking about like a causal mechanism and trying to figure out a biomarker in that pathway, then the kind of matrices I would be interested in for for me would be saliva, any any kind of tissue that would get at the oral microbiome.
