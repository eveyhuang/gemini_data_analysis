Um so maybe I'm not the best person to comment. But I think one of the things they were trying to elicit from us was thinking about um early stage biomarkers that um you know predate the onset of a lot of these um kind of follow on effects on physiology which is I think one of the major challenges in in things like Parkinson's disease um where some of the you know some things like prodromal Parkinson's is associated with constipation that would obviously lead to lots of changes in microbial or ripple effects on the microbial community.",

And I think that actually makes the problem harder and maybe even further pens you into a space where really the good mark biomarkers and this would be my own bias would be things that may be causal. Um and those would be the things that you would be able to detect actually early before you have the changes in physiology and a lot of the biomarkers that we use that people rely on are the opposite, right? They're the things that are the downstream effects of all of the ripple effects of those changes in physiology that come with that disease um on on host biology.",

Maybe there are some models that are conducive to this. But if we think about it, cohort design being coming back to um a human study, you know, how would you design that cohort, um and we just heard some discussion, the talk was on a young microbiome and old microbiome. So how do you know that you're not just getting the old microbiome effect uh as opposed to real early stage neuropathology.",

You know, we the things that we we sample are are the outputs or like sometimes like in the case of the stool is what the microbiota that didn't make it. It's kind of the end product like this averaging over a very long period of time and something that I think is exciting is some of the new tools that allow for sampling uh inside of the gut inside of the GI tract. Uh so like there's this smart pills that will grab some contents and bring them out where the actual processes are are happening. Um and that kind of goes back to uh Jenna's point about the study design uh you know, I think we need to expand our biobanks so that we don't have uh you know, for for say MRNA biomarkers, whatever ends up being in the stool is completely useless because it stopped producing that MRNA hours before and it's cyclically degraded.",

It was started over 10 years ago when I was in Toronto. But the gem study um was just published in Gastro last year looking at prospective IBD patients and and siblings. And so they designed this study to identify whether intestinal permeability was a predisposing factor to IBD uh in and so there was all these anecdotal evidences that um people had permeability defects prior to getting IBD and this was a designed specifically to address this and so they had um siblings uh of IBD patients and they looked at stool, they looked at biopsies and all these things and were able to identify permeability as a as a precursor to IBD in a genetically susceptible population. Um and I know that they collected all the stool and they haven't analyzed it yet, but that might be one way to look at biomarkers um for people that over time developed IBD. And so I'm not sure if a similar study could be designed with a specific neurodegenerative disease in mind where there is an genetic or environmental component that can be identified prior to onset. And then following although some of these the the process is a lot longer because the disease develops later in life compared to IBD, but it's just an example of something that was could be designed in order to get biomarkers prior to and then during. And then I just had a quick question about with CSF a potential fluid that could be used to look at a more direct location for biomarkers um in in neurodegenerative diseases. I'm not familiar enough to know.",

So I think I think CSF is important and I'm kind of still thinking back to what Noah said because in my mind I'm I'm also when I'm thinking about biomarkers, I'm thinking about mechanism, not kind of um symptoms of effect or signs of effect. So when I'm thinking about like a causal mechanism and trying to figure out a biomarker in that pathway, then the kind of matrices I would be interested in for for me would be saliva, any any kind of tissue that would get at the oral microbiome. And it it depends on the mechanism. So probably blood and then CSF. Like those are the three kind of um major things that I feel like could track an inflan an inflammation mechanism or even a translocation mechanism that I would be able to pick up on something.",
