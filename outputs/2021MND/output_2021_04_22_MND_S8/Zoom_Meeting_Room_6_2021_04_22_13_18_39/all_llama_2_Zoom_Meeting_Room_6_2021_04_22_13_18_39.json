But I think one of the things they were trying to elicit from us was thinking about um early stage biomarkers that um you know predate the onset of a lot of these um kind of follow on effects on physiology which is I think one of the major challenges in in things like Parkinson's disease um where some of the you know some things like prodromal Parkinson's is associated with constipation that would obviously lead to lots of changes in microbial or ripple effects on the microbial community.",

Um and those would be the things that you would be able to detect actually early before you have the changes in physiology and a lot of the biomarkers that we use that people rely on are the opposite, right?

It was started over 10 years ago when I was in Toronto. But the gem study um was just published in Gastro last year looking at prospective IBD patients and and siblings. And so they designed this study to identify whether intestinal permeability was a predisposing factor to IBD uh in and so there was all these anecdotal evidences that um people had permeability defects prior to getting IBD and this was a designed specifically to address this and so they had um siblings uh of IBD patients and they looked at stool, they looked at biopsies and all these things and were able to identify permeability as a as a precursor to IBD in a genetically susceptible population. Um and I know that they collected all the stool and they haven't analyzed it yet, but that might be one way to look at biomarkers um for people that over time developed IBD. And so I'm not sure if a similar study could be designed with a specific neurodegenerative disease in mind where there is an genetic or environmental component that can be identified prior to onset. And then following although some of these the the process is a lot longer because the disease develops later in life compared to IBD, but it's just an example of something that was could be designed in order to get biomarkers prior to and then during. And then I just had a quick question about with CSF a potential fluid that could be used to look at a more direct location for biomarkers um in in neurodegenerative diseases.

And so that presents a challenge but also an opportunity to set up systems that will fund research that can really span an entire lifetime and um and and also here, you know, the study design becomes really important of course because you you want to be uh following people for a really long time so that some of these microbiota effects can become uh evident.

So, um, when we analyze the a metabolome, we might have a decent idea of the identities of 5% of the features that we can detect in a sample. But that doesn't stop us. We're not going to only focus on the 5% we can name. We take all of those features and we look for, do these, which of these features correlate with disease? And then the next step is, beyond correlation, which of these features predict disease in a new cohort? If they check out, then we'll do the work to find out what that feature is. But even if we never know what it is, we can describe it. We can say under these conditions, we're going to see it with this mass at this set of retention times and that's still information. Um, so it's just like knowing a gene sequence even though you don't know what that gene does. You don't have to know what the metabolite is for it to be a predictive biomarker so long as you can reliably measure it and you know from sample to sample, this mystery factor X, I know where it's at, I can pick it out and I can measure it.
