Uh, you know, they detect examples that are out there are like detecting blood, right? So they'll detect heme and if they find heme in the gut, then they'll send a signal. That's pretty cool. That's uh Tim Lou's group. Mark Mimi actually probably knows a lot about that. I think he designed one of those.
