And so we can pull together biomarkers that are microbiomes, that are enzymes, that are metabolites, um, that are family history or genetics and and these can all work together to to help you find a good correlation or prediction of disease.

        "utterance": "Tom Mansell, Iowa State University: I think that's a great point and one thing I think we need to consider is how orthogonal does a biomarker need to be, right? Certain things, right, you know, blood pressure could be an indicator for stroke too, right? And you know, and so how many, how many data points do you need to resolve a disease state, um, and you know, in terms of bacteria, in terms of, you know, if you're designing sensors, right? How many uh inputs do you need? And that makes, you know, you know, in my world in synthetic biology that makes your cellular circuit much more complex when you have more than one input, right? So, um, you know, the things I would be interested in are the most orthogonal, uh, you know, now, that's a big ask, right? Um, but uh, and also detectable in the physiological range, right? So that's all I need. Um, but uh, I think it's something to consider when you're kind of thinking about the importance of these. Like for example, like butyrate, I mean, has lots of different impacts on all kinds of things. There's inflammation, there's as Bob mentioned the carbon source for uh colonocytes, right? So I feel like when you're thinking for me personally, when I'm thinking about biomarkers, I'm thinking about things that are a lot more specific to particular disease states. Um, but that's just my own interest, that's where I'm coming from. ",
