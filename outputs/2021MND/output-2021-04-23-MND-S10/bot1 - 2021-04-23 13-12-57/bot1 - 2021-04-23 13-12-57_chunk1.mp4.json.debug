I'm in chemical engineering and uh our lab focuses on uh our goal is to engineer live biotherapeutics. So uh enabling uh engineered probiotics to secrete small molecules or peptides or proteins that would have a therapeutic effect on the host. Um, and we do this using uh genome engineering in those bugs, but also uh using prebiotics to manipulate their populations. Um, and so my goal here is to uh kind of find targets. We focus a lot on the chassis uh right now and so uh my goal is to find small molecule metabolites that would be good to have around or get rid of um and uh so I think this discussion will be good for that.
