But, um, what about, you know, the same, not that anybody would have exactly the same microbial composition, right? That would be uh, very unusual. But like, you know, the same a similar composition might give you totally different phenotypes in a in two hosts, right? And so like maybe there are metabolomic ways of uh, of doing precision medicine that that where key metabolites are measured and you can say, okay, well, you know, if this person has a lot of build up of X, you know, it means that means something about metabolism of whatever drug of the of the line. Is is that a thing? Um, or are people really focusing on genetics and micro, you know, the first and second genome, let's say as the um, as the the focus for precision medicine.",

So looking at the transcriptional profile or the metabolomic profile, that might be a little bit more informative for uh for what's occurring.",
