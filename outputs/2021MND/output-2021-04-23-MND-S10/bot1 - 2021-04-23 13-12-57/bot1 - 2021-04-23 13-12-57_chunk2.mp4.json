Like how does the bacterial signal get sensed in the first place and are the are the like the abundance of these metabolites enough to like stimulate a signal and are there enough channels, specific channels that could sense one of these metabolites that the bacteria would be uh producing or is it more of an aggregate signal uh from the whole community that's being sensed or uh so be able to point out that it might be like specific molecules that are really important.",
