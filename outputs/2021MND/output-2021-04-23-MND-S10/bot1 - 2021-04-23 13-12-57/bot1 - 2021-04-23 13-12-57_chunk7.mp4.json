And that's where the EPA gets in and that's where the concerns uh really are. And also for the ethical dilemma of like, well, you could spread a microbiome from one person to another if you're in the same household. And even if person A is sick and is perfectly fine with eating an engineered bug, but you know, their brother or sister or spouse or kid is not and it transfers to them, then they've been unknowingly dosed with a drug. So there's definitely some ethical um issue there. But regardless, it seems like, you know, they're trying to grapple with the the ethics both on the environmental and the medical side of that and it's all moving forward uh at least from my opinion. It's not something it's something that should be figured out and not something that should be necessarily a bar to the field in general.",

Uh there's one company that was uh I I mean active biotics. I think it's been acquired by a bunch of different people so I don't even know what it's called anymore. And there's another one based in Boston uh called Synlogic. Um these are all in like phase two trials, all orally dosed. I know some folks that worked at Synlogic and their clinical trial was giving people a half a liter of bacterial culture at a concentration of like 10 to the 11 CFU per mill. And that was approved by the FDA. So it's like really high dosing of bugs going into people um and they've had good phase two results I think or phase 1A phase 1B sorry, phase two results and they're moving forward from there. So",
