So what the the thought is is we make an assumption in the field that iron is mostly in the reduced state in the gut because the gut is a reducing environment, but um, but there are times when there is more iron three oxidized form, which can happen through inflammation, um, through you know, production of Ross or nitric oxide species. Um, but yeah, bacteria do secrete siderophores in uh the the microbiome. The human also secretes enzymes to capture uh iron three, reduce it to iron two so that it can be brought inside of cells. But I think we have a poor understanding of the dynamics of that. Um, how much of the iron is three versus two. I also fascinated that we have that the body it's the iron is so valuable as you know, as we know, for so many processes that there's no way for the body to um, the body doesn't regulate iron levels except for excretion through stool. That's its only way to get like rid of it. Um, and it's um, but we don't understand really the dynamics of what's happening there and um what the the yeah, oxidation states are and how this changes with dysbiosis of a microbiome. Um, what does this mean at like an uh metal a metal level specifically iron is what what I'm you know wonder about.",

So whether or not um there's benefit to looking at targeted versus untargeted metabolomics and if you do have a candidate that you're interested in like really following the mechanism of how this metabolite is getting across the blood brain barrier acting locally on a Vegas nerve, um what it might be doing to the gut, which cell types might be interacting with or the opposite approach of just like this is everything that exists and they happen to be different. The metabolite black box is different in a disease state versus a healthy state. And so that means that there is something going on and then what are the next steps for characterizing and understanding what those differences mean.",
