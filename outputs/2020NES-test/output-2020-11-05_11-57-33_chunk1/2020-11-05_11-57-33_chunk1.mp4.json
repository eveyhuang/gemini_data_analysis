I'm a physicist by training, but I mostly work with computational materials design where I use atomistic level theories, uh molecular dynamics, density functional theory, kinetic Monte Carlo model. Main goal in my group is to design advanced oxides by studying defects interaction with interfaces or surfaces to understand the properties and use that knowledge to, you know, develop newer materials or technologies. And work with a lot of experimentalists, so hopefully that will also work out here. Hopefully, I look forward to that as well. Thank you.",
