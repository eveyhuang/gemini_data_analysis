I'm actually a stay at home mom and I was prior to the pandemic as well, so obviously my work situation really didn't change. Um, the I was worried at the beginning because I actually I had a baby in February 2020. So my younger son was a newborn when the pandemic started. And obviously there was a lot of, you know, concern, like if he got it, you know, what would it be like for him. So in the early weeks and months, my main concern was protecting him because I mean, normally you don't want newborns to get sick with anything. Um, but especially when it's like an unknown virus. So that was scary for me. Um, but otherwise, uh, like my my personal life didn't change all that much. My husband is an essential worker, so he went to work like he did before, you know, and he worked and continued. So in that way we were fortunate because there was no change in income or anything like that in my household. Um, and my older son's probably affected the most because he was in preschool, uh, going to school three mornings a week and then obviously that shut down in March 2020. So then he was home with me obviously every day all the time from March, you know, for the rest of that spring, the summer, but then his preschool actually reopened in September 2020 and I chose to send him back. And uh, I don't regret that at all because he's he's a smart kid, he's social and he really missed that and he had a great year. He would like eight kids in his class, you know, they had to wear masks and they had various protocols that the school had to follow. But overall he had a um a good year and he learned a lot and uh, you know, he never brought home COVID or anything like that. So it was good."

      "transcript": "Yeah, I can start. Um, so my pandemic experience um was in the beginning was very interesting actually. Um, I in February of 2020 went to China for Chinese New Year. Yeah. Yeah, and of course I was unaware of um the coronavirus at that point. Yeah. Um, on the way there like on the flight there no one was wearing masks or I mean, I hadn't really heard about it. I think if I some people who are very much monitoring the situation, they started to hear things, but I wasn't aware. Um, but then coming back, definitely that's when I realized there was something happening where the flight attendants were all wearing masks and they also required us to wear masks too. So that was my introduction um, as far as like the general, my general pandemic experience, I think I had it um pretty all right or like pretty well off compared to many other people's experiences. Um, for example, like I was already a remote worker, so I didn't have to adjust that. Um, yeah, and then my family was very like paranoid, so they just stayed inside. So we had no health scares in my family. Um, I had some roommates, so I know some of my friends experienced loneliness, but luckily I was able to like have that socialization with my roommates. Um, and the only thing I really had to hold back on or like I had to take a step back from was I was getting ready to go to grad school and I was accepted and you know, I wanted to take that next step in life. Um, but because of the pandemic, I decided to defer um and not do that because it didn't really make sense at the time. But I think overall um, yeah, my experience was not too bad in the grand scheme of things. Um, yeah, I would love to hear about yours."
