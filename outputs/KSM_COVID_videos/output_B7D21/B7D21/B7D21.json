He is also very open about his experience with COVID and the vaccine. He is also very respectful of the other participant's opinions. Participant B7D21 is also engaged in the conversation, but she is not as open as participant 1045. She is also more hesitant to share her opinions. She is also more focused on the facts of the situation rather than the emotional aspects."
