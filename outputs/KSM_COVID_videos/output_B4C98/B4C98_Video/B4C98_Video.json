He also seems to be more skeptical about the effectiveness of the vaccine and boosters. The participant 1045 seems to be more open to the vaccine and boosters, but she also had some symptoms after getting the shots. Overall, the conversation is respectful and both participants seem to be trying to understand each other's perspectives."
