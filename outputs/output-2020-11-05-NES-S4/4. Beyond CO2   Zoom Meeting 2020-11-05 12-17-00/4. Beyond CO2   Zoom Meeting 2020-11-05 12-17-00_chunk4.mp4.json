That's how you're pushing, you know, you're pushing the frontier. Jordi, if I can jump into, I've been quiet and I'll reiterate my caveat that I'm I'm the non-scientist in the room here. But I had the same question as I was as I've been listening is tying it back to the negative emissions goal. I've been trying to kind of bucket what I'm hearing into what sound to me like things that would fall into a stricter definition of negative emissions of actually removing, removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere or the ocean that have been emitted previously by some other process versus decarbonizing some existing process or replacing it, replacing an existing process that emits. So that, you know, you that I would put that in kind of the mitigation basket, not the negative emissions basket. So Jordi, I think I may be just saying what you said in a different way, but that's also where my head goes is trying to understand how what what of this discussion is more relevant to kind of reducing future emissions versus having pathways to actually, you know, quote unquote undo emissions and reduce existing greenhouse gas stocks.",
