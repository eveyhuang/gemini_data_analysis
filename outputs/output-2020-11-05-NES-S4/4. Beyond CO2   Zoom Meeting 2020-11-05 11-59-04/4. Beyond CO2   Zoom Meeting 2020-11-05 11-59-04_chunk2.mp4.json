            "transcript": "Sorry, I was muted. It's been a couple of minutes, so I think we're going to start the discussion. Just a couple of ideas/tips. My role here as a facilitator is mostly to listen and perhaps make sure that you all feel empowered to intervene and share your ideas. So please do. You don't have to wait for me to call on you, but I would like to hear from everybody. I'm interested in all that you have to say. As somebody who's been on your side and has been on Marta's position right now, which is to record, it's very helpful if you are able to build from each other's ideas and see if that converges. It doesn't have to converge, but think about it in that aspect as well. You know, how would you build your ideas on top of somebody else's? Because the goal of the recorder is to distill the big, more than just say everything that was said. It's important that the recorder finds the ideas that are gaining the most traction. That makes the report's job easier and also more impactful when you go to the report out, which will happen after we're done. So, with that, I'm just going to take a step to the side and see if somebody wants to get the discussion started by using some of the ideas that you wrote down.",

            "transcript": "I'm happy to start. One of the things, especially going beyond CO2, one of the things obviously is nitrogen transformation, nitrogen to ammonia or just ammonia, sustainable ammonia synthesis in general. I think the real thing is doing that as low temperature ammonia synthesis. That could be direct electrochemical or probably more practical is to do a low temperature hydrogenation for distributed ammonia because the issue right now is when you do elevated temperatures, you have to do elevated pressures of H2 to overcome the thermodynamic barriers of increasing the temperature to go to the kinetic barriers of nitrogen nitrogen bond cleavage. So if you can do low temperature, if you can break that nitrogen nitrogen bond kinetically at lower temperatures, then you don't need as much hydrogen pumping in. You don't need the pressures of hydrogen which allows you to use electrolytic hydrogen from solar hydrogen. Or you could do direct electrochemical, although I think that's very, very hard to out compete hydrogen evolution for electrochemical ammonia.",

            "transcript": "Can I follow this nitrogen cycle? Yeah. Yeah. So, of course, we see the demotivation converts nitrogen to ammonia. It's very important and a very good idea. But the next step, I think the first step forming formation of nitrogen ammonia is very, very challenging, right? And then next step ammonia to nitrate to other chemicals cannot be overlooked. Actually, it's also very energy consuming and energy intensive for the current processes. So the new processes, for example, electrochemical conversion of the ammonium to nitrogen is also beneficial to the whole point. And backward, the nitrate reduction, I think that's something also important because for the environmental issues, right? So current technology also use a lot of thermal treatment and separation process to reduce it. So we can also develop technology. I have one year front to monitor this. This because it's my birth.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I'll jump in there too and say in addition to like, so we're going through the I think we're all touching on all the different nitrogen transformations, but looking at like direct nitrogen oxidation, so you can skip the nitrogen to ammonia, ammonia to nitknocks, um, like doing direct nitrogen oxidation, um, has not been demonstrated from my perspective. Um, it has been demonstrated in papers, but I would say that that still has not really been demonstrated. That would be a large energy savings instead of having to go through ammonia as an intermediate. Um, with the question of the nitrogen also, um, I think that there's lots of questions on, um, I know there's lots of questions on whether like ammonia should be used as a fuel as well as like a fertilizer. Um, and I think that from a from a perspective, um, from a life cycle perspective, um, you're running into questions that mirror that with respect to ethanol. Um, and so like so my my main thing is like talking about where we really do think ammonia should be used. Like kind of needs to be something that is defined in the literature. I'm hesitant to say that it's the end all molecule. Um, and so like so my my main thing is like talking about where we really do think ammonia should be used. Like kind of needs to be something that is defined in the literature. I'm hesitant to say that it's the end all molecule for all applications, but that's starting to emerge as a topic. So I would I would agree nitrogen oxidation. I'm just adding that.",

Um, the at least at this moment, the biggest part of nitrogen ammonia use is fertilizers and you better go organic anyway because in agriculture and some of the as mentioned earlier, like nature anyway can do it, they just do it slower and without renewable source. One way we thought about is actually we are doing is just feeding electricity to accelerate nitrogenase, um, which have done pretty well in MBA environment for millions of years and you get organic fertilizer out of the buck and you just feed it spray through the ground, you don't need to separate that, um, because anyway they go to the ground in a field. Um, another thing I want to add on similarly as the messing which we haven't touched on yet, but nature has enzyme to do messing too. Maybe they just need an energy source like electrochemistry to get accelerated, um, and to fix and mitigate that. And another way can think about organism catalysis is they replicate themselves. So they can self it's it's should be long lasting enough.",

I mean, this is not like a completely new idea, but the the conversion, so basically the electro catalytic generation of food for enzymes, right? So like I mean, people have tried to make efficient system for NAD+ to NADH. I mean, I know you can use hydrogen and have some work itself, but there might be much more efficient ways if you generate the food for the enzyme, the driving force electrochemically directly. And as far as I understand, there's still huge hurdles in terms of both activity and over potential associated with that. I don't know what's the food for methane oxygenases.",
