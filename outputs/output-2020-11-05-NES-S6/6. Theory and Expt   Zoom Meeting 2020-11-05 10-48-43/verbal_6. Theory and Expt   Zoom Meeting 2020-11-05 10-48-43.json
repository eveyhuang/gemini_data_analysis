So, I think that there's like a there's a difference in strategy which gives us less information that we can potentially benchmark to.

It's just finding the right match in terms of like uh finding this one experimentalist group that is interested in going the whole way, right? Right from synthesizing what you think works to to showing that that is indeed the pathway. So, I I think it's nice that like most fields are moving towards teams of people.

I don't know if uh anybody of us really understand it. I don't think anybody does, but we can we can make it with the glasses of usefulness, right? So, it's definitely useful. It has been proven to be useful. And it's just a natural thing of um you know, a multi-dimensional analysis especially for structure property relationships. So um you can see it how it works, right? So it's a multi-dimensional thing that it's I don't know, 12, 13 dimensions, but you can reduce it to a component um that it could be understand by understood by a human brain. So, one of the things I I think I I will have to go back to the original um comment that I give, which is the negative results, right? So there was a very beautiful paper recently, well, not recently, three years ago where it was an organic synthesis, but you can train a machine learning model that takes into account the negative results of experiments. So at the end of the day, you were able to predict the the right reaction path and the right conditions that are the most optimal, right? So I think that's where um machine learning could be used because if you ever do any simple models with machine learning, you will learn that the more data, the better, right? So the more data that it's accurate, the better, the more data that it's um you know, uh that you can reproduce it better. So basically any data is good. So I think that it's something missing um that we can exploit both as experimentalists and as a computationally tradition-minded scientist that um we might be discarding um a lot of data that could be useful. Uh one quick example for theory could be, you know, when you do your your simulation of MD, you're trying to wait all these different snapshots that could be so useful. One example for experiments, those negative results um or where where we were seeing is the all these decay, maybe that decay can give you the the next design principle. But you know, those bottom line is um I think uh the current thing in machine learning probably that could be useful is just we need to find ways to get more information, more data that is more accurate and maybe look at places that we thought um you know, they were they were um rubbish, they were waste, but maybe they are useful.

Um, so, yeah, from from computation, I think the the interface is still all the methods that we're still using is, you know, um, electronic structure, uh, MD and to some degree Monte Carlo, but I think the new wave of method development that I see pretty much everywhere is just implementing machine learning for something, right? Machine learning for development, uh, for understanding the, uh, the wave function or machine learning to understanding, you know, a guess of transition state and so that's where method development I have seen, um, going in pretty much every area, you know, MD and and so on. Um, so, I don't know. My my my take on this is that is definitely the the way to go, but also because machine learning is so useful, so tempting, at the same time, we still don't understand the basics of it, right? It works. We just don't know why why it works at the fundamental level. So, my, um, I guess concern would be if all these new models or new, uh, developments or methods work, do we really truly understand everything? Because really machine learning part we don't fully understand it. We we just know it works. So it's just a question of, um, of once these method work and are developed and fully, uh, implemented, the question will be really, do we really understand all these? Because really the machine learning is still not clear there. ",
