What if we are doing electrochemical reaction of the bound CO2? Maybe temperature doesn't need to be increased. So for example, you can capture CO2 from, I don't know, cement plant or directly from air, and then put in the electrochemical reactor, which usually operates below 100 degrees C for sure, because you don't want to boil off all your electrolyte. More likely, low temperature, room temperature kind of application. And then you make products which feeds to the biological system. So now you're asking in a sense the right question, right? But you have to go even deeper. My process, does it has to be changed to tack to another technology before and after, right? Does the same regeneration technology make sense or not, right? That's where really hybrid collaboration can happen among you guys, right?",

I was recently, my lab was growing some bacteria working pH2. Um good thing about that is you have a lot you don't have much contamination at pH2 and you can add a lot of salt there, so the solution get much more conductive in terms of electrochemistry. And there are also alkaline files because I was talking to Joe yesterday. I met him in Gator and he asked me, can I put the bacteria inside the alkaline electrolyzer? And actually, if you go to literature, you can surprisingly. Um not too high. Not not pH14 but pH10, 11, no problem at all. You can get you can have bacteria in pH11 at three mole, five mole sodium chloride. Um and if you look at that, you realize um I mean, nature has a way to evolve and their multi-prongs approach how about technology handle things. It really depends and sometimes as a material people attempts by training, I feel like it's a treasure growth. Just look at it, sure you feel what do you want? You want acid bacteria? Okay, there are one. You want alkaline bacteria? There are one. But you need to find it out and find a way to use those.",

You can do do it isothermally, right? In other words, you can react your you can capture your CO2 at whatever temperature you want to do your reaction, right? And instead of regenerating material, you can just add your reactant, right? the other reactant, let's say CO2 hydrogenation, right? And do isothermally instead of you know, changing your base temperature. So I think yeah, you can do it isothermally. Yes, pressure of course, this is also challenge, but I think considering the temperature, it is possible that to do it isothermally so that we can reduce the amount of energy input.",

So maybe the optimal process for doing CO2 utilization maybe if you're combining biological systems, maybe a constant temperature, maybe pressure or vacuum swing process, right?

I was trying to get it in edgewise, but but couldn't. Um but in terms of hybrid approaches, I guess we think about ways of sort of coupling, you know, electrochemical, biological, thermal, and so on. I also think of hybrid as uh potentially a way of actually making better use of an of a resource that we are using to do separation or conversion. So, for example, we think about the solar resource, you have you know, let's say you try and do something photoelectrochemically and you have some solar cell, for example. It's going to harness a certain fraction of the spectrum. Um and then you're going to get a bunch a part of the spectrum that's you know, wasted. So let's say that's like thermal energy. If you engineer the system where you're sort of taking that thermal energy somewhere else to uh to do like a thermal you know, like a thermal separation in addition to the photoelectrochemical separation you're doing, then that's that's a hybrid approach that uses more of the solar resource to to accomplish separation or conversion. So, you know, it involves thinking about a reactor that has flow involved, so you're taking away the thermal energy. Um and then you could do like I mean, it doesn't have to be like thermoelectric, but it could be it could be thermal in addition to photoelectrochemical. So that's um another paradigm for thinking about hybrid approaches is. So so I added in the last sentence, but do you think that's the case? It's a it's a diverse portfolio in native machine science and you can better use the any solar energy source like you can use a couple with thermochemical with other native machine science, so better use the solar energy.",

That's very important when you put different types of reactors together with the grid, which is a fluctuating. Yeah. So you want integration and scale? It's called systems integration and optimization. Okay. At so you can say multi scale systems integration and optimization. So which means that you'll have grid producing power, right? If you're doing electrochemical, right? You need to use it as a power first. You're not going to drive that out and then burn additional fossil, right? So you'll have fluctuated like a province said, there's a fluctuating intermittent amount of electricity might be coming to your reactor, right? And you look at the chemical reactor and biological reactor has different rate of reactions and different size. Let's say you have a tiny reactor connected to huge reactor just because that's how volumetric flow rate is. Can we manage that? I mean, there's a lot more questions than just a plug and play, right? So how to provide energy? What kind of energy? And that's all about systems integration and optimization with both time scale and physical scale. And those are very important. And in fact, those solicitations were out there, so people are getting funding in this area, not in the hybrid technology. There was a proposed solicitation on connecting CO2 capture to storage. electricity grid market to the CCS. I remember.",
