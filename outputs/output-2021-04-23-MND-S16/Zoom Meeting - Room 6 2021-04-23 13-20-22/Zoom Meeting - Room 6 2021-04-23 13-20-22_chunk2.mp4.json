So we could collect the stool sample, but we collect blood sample in conjunction. And from the serum, sorry, from the stool, you can generate metagenome data. People can also look at fecal microRNA, which some of the microbiome are associated with. And from the blood, you can do immune profiling, transcriptomics, and so forth. And obviously, metabolomics. Um, we also have done some work looking at circulating DNA, looking for methylation profile, which is trying to basically use as little sample that we need from humans to infer a lot more information. So from the circulating DNA, we can infer tissue of origin. And specifically looking using single cell reference maps of methylation and so you can infer is there compared to the control level background, is there elevated level of say brain cells or or OPC cells or etc. That's in your circulating blood, that's beyond the normal turnover. This sort of work has been done primarily in cancer liquid biopsy, but we're trying to develop into biomarkers for neurodegeneration.",

It was by first author Ujkovic Sivision where it was published in nature and they found that a lot of these association studies done with microbiome data are confounded by host attributes such as smoking, obesity, etc. I see a lot of you nodding. So you guys have probably seen it. So, um, recently with a collaborator, we were trying to discuss what data do we need to collect apart from the stool data? And we took a look at that paper because we didn't want to be running into trouble with these confounders ourselves, though obviously noise correction methods and so on are needed. So that may be a useful resource.",

            "transcript": "I was going to add two comments to the discussion, although I'm wondering now if I remember both of them. Um, so one about utilizing specimens and like the expense of collecting from humans. I feel like, well, the vast majority of the expense is actually doing the collection, you know, employing research coordinators and recruitment efforts and things like that. Then, but I feel like, and this was sort of mentioned earlier, just even about the data, Stephanie mentioned this, the data and a data set, you might focus on one metabolic pathway and ignore the other 10,000 molecules that you might have collected information on. But it's even compounded by the fact that if you take a stool sample and what you're interested in or what you're interested in measuring are the metagenomes. There's so much other stuff in that stool that could be used. Maybe you don't know how to use it, maybe it's not part of your current study. But if you talk to someone who studies immune markers and stool, they could give you some idea of how could you preserve the stuff that you would be normally chucking in the garbage and put it in the freezer that they if they could, you know, find the funding to do it. The same thing goes for metabolomics. Um, there I talk with a lot of people who study transcriptomes or genomes and I'm like, you know, those cell suits that you chuck in the garbage after you spin your cells out, if you'll just put it in the freezer, there's some good stuff in there that I might be interested in looking at. And so I think that there's some opportunities for us to be able to piggy back, not just on ongoing studies to say, okay, yeah, now see if we can tag on a feces collection on top of that. But beyond just doing the thing that you know how to do and are interested in thinking about ways that you can preserve the stuff that you would normally throw away for additional analysis.",

            "transcript": "That's a really good point. I would just echo that in that when we collect samples, we follow the HMP2 protocol of collection in which they have basically one, again, we're talking about two sample collection. We have one tube that's coming from the ethanol containing vial, the other comes from a non-ethanol containing sort of a dry vial. And then we make aliquats for each. And for sequencing, we only need something like 100 nanograms from the ethanol containing tube. So, but we preserve some of the earmark for proteomics, but even though we're not really doing that right now. Um, some of the earmark for metabolomics from fecal metabolome, not just the serum metabolome, which is what I'm more interested in. And also for future experiments where you can, that's from the dry tube, you can sort of free, you know, culture potentially populate it to to to do the experiments, but even though we haven't, we've really just used, like, you know, I guess, 1/10 of the sample that we have collected so far. So that's a very good point.",

Um, so, um, just finding out, you know, just chatting with people and as you hear about weird studies that people do, um, finding out if there's anything special that needs to be done to a specimen that's different or not could be a useful thing. The second point I was going to make, and sorry if I'm monopolizing the conversation, is related to um, the confounders that Nandita brought up about smoking and and such. I feel like, um, you know, there are only a few data sets where they've done a really good job of describing the natural variation in healthy populations. And to look for biomarkers of disease, you need to ideally be looking for perturbations from natural, from healthy, from, you know, typical. Um, and so trying to at least utilize the few studies that, for instance, healthy human metabolism study that says there are massive age and sex age interactions that need to be considered in the metabolome. Are there similar things that need to be considered in other omics that need to be controlled for before you even start to look into disease versus healthy?",

And in single cell RC, we have a similar problem, but we are able to leverage the correlation between different genes and to align different data set together and kind of integrate across different assets. Can we leverage the correlation structure within microbiome or metabolome to integrate multiple data set together so that you can borrow information from different study?",
