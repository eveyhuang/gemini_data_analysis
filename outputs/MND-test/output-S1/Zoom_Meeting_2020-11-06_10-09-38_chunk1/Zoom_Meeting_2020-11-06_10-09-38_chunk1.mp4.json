Um, I'd like to add to the sentence of the introductions this morning. If there's something you'd like to see done in this breakout that, you know, as an outcome or as a process or whatever. If there's something about the way that we do this that you'd like to add, please add it. So, I'll start. I'm Roger Ames. I am the chief scientist of the energy program at Lawrence Livermore National Lab, which is one of the US National Labs. And I work pretty much full-time on negative emissions technologies. And pertinent to this breakout, one of our biggest efforts is in electrochemical reduction, although we don't do much on the actual catalysis. We build the catalysis, the catalyst into bigger reactors, mostly using additive manufacturing. So that's my background. Um, we'll go next to Fang.",

I'm a computational material scientist, studying materials and atomic scale such as the heterogeneous electrocatalysis for CO2 reduction. And my research, my group recently developed some new computational models which can give kinetic information and cannot be given by previous models and can also explain experiments which cannot be explained previously. So I'm looking forward to using this model to help you understand your experiments and atomic scale. Thank you.",

My research group has been working on both battery chemistry and electrocatalysis. Regarding the topic for this conference, we have been working on both electrochemical reduction for CO2 and N2 reductions. And recently we have got a lot of chance for interactions for CO2 reduction. We have been working on both, you know, protein-based and heterogeneous-based catalysts for upgrading of CO2 with enzymes for class study and collaboration with computational chemists. Yeah, that's what we have been doing. Yeah, we have also focused not focused on the device development for fuel cell and flow cell, something like that.",
