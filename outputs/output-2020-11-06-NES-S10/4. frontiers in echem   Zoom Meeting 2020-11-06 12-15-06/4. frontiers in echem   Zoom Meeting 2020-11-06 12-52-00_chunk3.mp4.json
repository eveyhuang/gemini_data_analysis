Um but it's, uh I mean part of it is, is obviously the, the fully oxidized thermodynamic product. The other problem is that as you start oxidizing it, the CH bonds get weaker and weaker and become easier to activate even under ambient conditions. Because if you have something that's active enough to activate methane, it, it's easier to activate the products in almost all cases. I'm not saying it's not doable.

I mean, I looked at this like years ago. Yeah. Uh but I haven't, I haven't kept up with any of that literature, but I think, but that, that was bottlenecked at that point by having a, a, a proton conductor, right? Because there are no, this, this sort of, I guess Narby gap, right? There's great conductors for protons at like low temperature and high temperature, but nothing in this sort of middle. Uh so that might be a frontier for electrochemistry also in that, you know, enabling intermediate uh electrochemistry requires actually new material sets.",
