Of course, the big challenge is that the coke in steel making has a very particular morphology, chemical properties, and so on. It's difficult to make a biochar that can directly replace it. But that's one big opportunity to decarbonize steel making. Take biochar and replace coke.",

And that's where you start to see some of those benefits too and you're substituting for the pet coke or whatever.",

So it's a type of coal in the US. Europe's been a bit ahead of us on all of this in terms of developing the types of databases you use in EcoInvent's under the big ones. The US has the US lifecycle inventory from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which has some of the processes, but it's missing. So usually you need to fill in. And the USDA NIFA actually has been putting together a lot of the agricultural databases. I mean, agriculture is a little bit interesting, right? Because like depending how you produce a kilogram of corn, it could be bad or good in terms of things like additive amendments, water, energy. So I mean, I think the US is lagging a little bit behind on the actual inventory data to characterize our systems, whereas Europe's been doing.",

But then we also have the third party verification. Right? So the third party verification needs to have experimental methodologies or simulation software or lifecycle analysis tools to verify that everything that is going on in that in that circle is is actually true. So and and that's something that we need a lot of. I'm I'm part of the peer review board member of Nori, which is the carbon market that's most active right now in the US. And what they are relying currently on is something called, I think it's called Comet. Right? So it's a software that simulates if you do this and this and this to your soil, this will be how much carbon you're sequestering. So it's based on a lot of assumptions and it's based on, yeah, a huge amount of uncertainty. But that's the best they have right now. So that's what they're relying on. But I see that this space needs to grow a lot. So you need much better tools, much better. So that's both experimental and and modeling and predictive tools to really verify that what's going on is actually true.",

And I think that there is such a diversity of opinion here that it becomes very clear that it's not only one challenge, it's just the whole convolution of and and and the streams within the economy are are not very clear. So my question then is if there would be any value or if we could come up with some with a concept that would allow us to kind of like address this problem. You see, like actually see like why why aren't we precipitating specific like solution? And then say like, well, this is most likely because we are lacking the information. So we may actually need to go and get the relevant information that allows us to then address the conversation question.",

I mean, I I suspect, I mean, I'm pretty sure that your in the US economy, the largest contribution to CO2 emissions is is land transport.
