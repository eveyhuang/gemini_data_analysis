utterance:  Alissa Park: I think it's great to talk about the source of CO2 because when you talk about CCUS, most of the CO2 capture people are trying to get pure CO2 and compress it at 150 atmospheric pressure to put it into pipeline. But if you co-locate the conversion with the capture, now you have to tell capture people what is your criteria, what your feed stock should look like. And if you look at there's a lot of funding went into national labs from BTO, Bioenergy Technology Office, and they always assume that they're going to upgrade whatever electrochemical people produced biologically. And that was really interesting when I reviewed their program because they all start with formate. So they assume this, like they're going to get CO2, electrochemists will get CO2 from biorefinery which is the cheapest CO2 and pure CO2 you can get because what you get is a wet CO2, you just need to remove water if you need to. So that's the like purest and easiest CO2 to get at this time. And then they say, okay, the older electrochemists will give me formate and that's where they started. Is it right assumption? I don't know, right? And they are saying biological pathway from formate to larger molecule is easier than electrochemistry from CO2 to larger molecule. Question.

If you would produce that by a by means that would produce more CO2, clearly this technology would contribute to to negative emission even though you're making a new carbon product from it.

utterance:  Yuanyue Liu: like CO2 reduction into elementary steps and for each elementary step they calculate the like energy difference between the products and the reactants and from there you can get some uh you can say whether the step is uphill or downhill and how uphill or downhill it is and then you can identify so called potential limiting step and then you can compare different catalysts and see which one has the like least potential limiting step and therefore the best uh catalytic activity. But but but this is just thermodynamics uh and as you just mentioned the kinetic information is is actually much more relevant to the uh reaction rate. So and when we consider the uh if you want to model the kinetics then it's very critical to consider the effect of the electrons and also effects of the salvation all these things become matter and um so I I I will give one example. So so for example I studied the single metal atom single nickel atom in nitrogen for CO2 reduction. So this catalyst has a very high selectivity and also activity for CO2 reduction to CO. But if you just look at the thermodynamics you will find that the hydrogen evolution reaction which is a side reaction is actually much more favorable than CO2 reduction which contradicts with the experimental finding that the hydrogen evolution is very uh very little for such catalyst. So this is because um like the salvation uh uh factor. So uh so so when we come this chemically unsolved CO2 and this CO2 can get some negative charge from the uh from catalyst then the negative charge CO2 can have the can form the hydrogen bonding with the with the water which it's kind of similar to the uh quantum effects that uh was mentioned uh previously. Uh but but if you just have hydrogen unsolved on the side the hydrogen would not be much negatively charged so you do not have such contribution from the hydrogen bond to stabilize the intermediate. So this salvation um will steer the pathway into CO2 reduction instead of hydrogen evolution reaction. Yes, so this is just one example to show it's important to consider I would say it's micro environment instead of just salvation. Um and also the kinetic um parameters or not sometimes reaction um is thermodynamically favorable but it's just kinetically not favorable. We also see it in uh in in in several uh situations. Yeah, I guess another critical factor which I find uh important and maybe overlooked uh in some sense is that the charge capacity of the catalyst or the site. If you could accumulate more electrons on the catalytic site then that would in general uh lowers the barrier for the electrochemical reduction and good for uh catalysis as well. So

utterance:  Zhou Lin (UMass QC) (she/her): So I would like to say a little bit more about the problem of the theory we have now. One is like the the evaluation of salvation is actually the model is actually really, really bad even for the single is hydroxide. I think we the theory all of the theory underestimate the salvation energy by 1.2 electron volt. So that's that's a very huge difference so at this stage we still have to use experimental value for that.

utterance:  Zhou Lin: will say hydroxides only carry like a half charge, but the it it it deposit the other half to the surface, but we know that it's not physical. So these are some some of the fundamental problem of the theory. So we hope like we can get better model to do that. And the other thing I want to say a little bit about experimental study which I collaborate with those people in in Germany and the paper will come out this week. So they actually use some I don't know the details though, but I know they use some terahertz spectroscopy. So they can see what's going on exactly on surface.

utterance:  Venkat Viswanathan: So I think I think this uh there are two aspects that I think could be quite interesting uh uh where machine learning can help.

Uh, so I think there machine learning could probably give you additional tools uh to analyze uh even deconvolve uh whatever kinds of measurements you're you're you're trying to fuse together, right?

utterance:  Carlos Morales Guio: And uh the the thing is that we also need to to probably do experiments in the lab scale in a in a in a system that is actually relevant to to any scale up or industrialization. So as part of the first year of the C look, we have developed a gas tight rotating cylinder electrode cell where we put the model uh copper polyline copper electrode and we rotate it at different uh rates. And as you rotate it, even though you have the same potential, you actually start to see dramatic changes in in selectivity. We already also we have the preprint in in our website. So what we see is that actually mass transport control selectivity and the the the problem is a little bit more complex. So you actually have a lot of uh CO that is a main reaction intermediate that dissolves and hangs around near the surface of the electrode long enough. So at the the near the surface of the electrode it actually behaves as a sort of CSTR, a continuous stirred tank reactor and then uh what happens is that we get a lot of high uh conversion of CO and uh theory is trying to do a lot of mechanistic understanding of of those systems actually on under high uh conversion of CO and uh typically you don't study kinetics under those conditions, right? Uh but now that I think we have a good uh system, right? Uh uh a reactor that you can control mass transport and and see the influence of mass transport in electrocatalysis, I think uh now what we see is that we can actually understand the the mechanism of CO2 reduction on copper uh much easily. Uh it makes a lot of sense and then uh what you have in gas diffusion electrodes is essentially a system where the the residence time of carbon monoxide is very long. Uh so

utterance:  Carlos Morales Guio: you have a system that has very long residence time for carbon monoxide, uh then you start to look at it more sort of a plug flow reactor. Uh so long story short, I think the challenge was to get an electrochemical cell that allows you to control mass transport and at the same time allows you to do product quantification and detection. Um so I think we have accomplished that through and I think that that that should open the the door to scale up these systems.

utterance:  Richard Wiener RCSA: All right, excellent. Uh thank you Carlos and uh folks can pursue more discussion with Carlos and some of these other points uh in the slack channel or on chat.

utterance:  Greeshma Gadikota: Hi everyone. Um my name is Greeshma Gadikota and I'm going to be uh reporting um for our team. I'd like I'm very grateful for David's support and for our facilitators Chris and Ellen as well as our excellent participants. So there were several aspects that came up uh over the course of our discussion uh particularly in the context of the need for DAC. Um so one of the nice things about direct air capture is that it can be deployed independently of point source emissions and as we continue as we continue to use fossil fuels, there is going to be an increased need for DAC, particularly from sectors that are challenging to decarbonize such as transportation.

utterance:  Greeshma Gadikota: You're going to need DAC to clean up emissions from uh such sectors. Uh one of the interesting things that came up over the course of our discussion was the fact that there is considerable geographical variability in resources and how that might actually impact the deployment of CO2 capture and DAC technologies. 
annotation:  {'Idea Management': {'explanation': 'The utterance elaborates on the need for DAC and introduces the new idea of geographical variability impacting deployment of CO2 capture and DAC technologies, contributing to the flow of ideas.', 'score': 2, 'score_justification': "The utterance introduces a novel and elaborated idea about geographical variability, which is a reasoned contribution that moves the team's understanding of DAC deployment forward."}, 'Knowledge Sharing': {'explanation': "The utterance shares specific knowledge about the 'considerable geographical variability in resources' and its impact on CO2 capture and DAC deployment, which is a relevant finding from her team's discussion.", 'score': 2, 'score_justification': "The utterance provides accurate and detailed knowledge about geographical variability and its impact on DAC deployment, which is directly useful for the team's understanding."}}
utterance:  Greeshma Gadikota: So for example, if you're in regions of the world where uh moisture contents are different or in certain locations where the compositions of air are even different, separation technologies will need to be tailored for such regions. Uh this is a challenge but it's also an opportunity because it locks it it helps us unlock many fresh ideas and innovations in the context of DAC. Uh and perhaps you can take some of that understanding and translate that for CO2 capture as well from diverse set of um emissions. So with that said, our team uh sees the challenge of variability of compositions as something that can actually unlock more innovation. So we think it's actually a positive in the context of uh innovating in this space. We also think that understanding durability, economic costs and incentive structures are crucial under real world operating conditions and this actually goes back to the point that uh Carlos had made about uh the need for molecular scale science as well as the process scale engineering to come together to inform economic costs and incentive structure incentive structures. So they so really there is a need for cross scale thinking in this particular line of work. Uh this line this approach may be unconventional for some of the other research areas but in this area, it is crucially needed.

utterance:  Greeshma Gadikota: Uh another important consideration uh which is unique to DAC is that we need to consider the end fate of CO2 and that would really dictate where we would actually put or implement DACs, is the CO2 going to be stored underground, is it going to be coupled to utilization, is it going to be coupled to mineralization, in which case the kind of DAC technology that would get deployed might need to get customized.

utterance:  Greeshma Gadikota: And also this brought up the question of uh CO2 conversion to products and our team took the view that CO2 conversion to products is insufficient from the perspective of climate. We wrapped up our discussion from a rather big picture perspective of where DAC and CO2 capture are headed and so when we look at industrial decarbonization, we're starting to see that there is defossilization of crucial commodities like ammonia, even cement and construction materials. This is something that's going to get realized over the course of the next 10 to 20 years or so. So in this context of defossilization, what is going to be the emerging role of DAC and CO2 capture?

utterance:  Kelsey Hatzell: Um we took a little bit of a different perspective from the previous group and looked at a little bit more of the upscale challenge. Um uh I think the previous group kind of articulated that uh there's opportunity for DAC to be um uh operate uh independent of point of source um applications. Um one of the things that was a pretty like well established thought process that we talked in great detail was um the value proposition of combining point of source um treatment with DAC. Um given the fact that a lot of the infrastructure can be repurposed um and having that onsite is going to be potentially an economic advantage for that approach. Um we talked a lot about Zorbins, um uh just we talked about Ecam, electrochemistry and Zorbins. Um most of our discussion was on Zorbins with a little bit of echem at the end, but from the Zorbins we talked about it'd be nice to have a singular Zorbint that operated um across various concentrations so you could um have it um very versatile in terms of operating with point of source as well as direct air capture and both of those applications where you have concentrations. We talked about the challenges again with different properties based off of geographic locations and why that might be a more of a challenge to have a singular um Zorbint. Um we talked about uh again, larger scale issues um in terms of treatment trains, um whether we want to integrate um direct air capture with point of source or we want to combine those um to produce um uh you know, fuels or integrate it with conversion applications. Um how we integrate multiple technologies is going to be a um energy systems level challenge. Um we also talked a little bit about uh kind of how we can innovative ways for um integrating direct air capture. There was a lot of discussion on um transportation um areas like planes, submarines, spacecraft, things where we have a lot of moving parts already and how can we potentially utilize these systems that have existing infrastructure that would be valuable for DAC um as a way to um excentuate DAC as it exists. Um given that the fossil fuel and DOE announced today the earth shot for $100 um per ton for DAC. Um we talked about what are pathways toward that goal. Um whether the innovation um and advancement in science and new technology will get us there. Um some of the thoughts were really about how we can just use repurposing um and potentially the less glamorous um approach of like how can we take um abandoned coal mines or abandoned infrastructure and repurpose that for DAC systems may be the fastest way to getting to that goal. Um however ambitious that is because most um DAC is around 300 to $500 currently. Um we briefly talked about policy um and uh the different opportunities and there was an a one cited evidence of of a uh positive policy um or mutualistically positive policy um where farmers if we're thinking about um carbon um capture in soils, um there's mutualistic benefit to the farmer for soil health and different ways that we can inter um interject policy to um accelerate the adoption of DAC. Um and lastly, we ended our conversation not to um let electrochemistry um not hit the stage a little bit about really um the versatility of electrochemical systems for carbon capture and carbon conversion. Um but other than that, I think that's really covers what we discussed.

utterance:  Katie Knowles (U. Rochester): our discussion and so um so we're talking about materials for separation and storage and uh we talked a lot about the challenges for materials discovery and development and I think some of these um are continuing on some themes that were discussed in other groups. So gaps between computational predictions and experiments, the fact that like if um you know if a computational study identifies a new material that might be um advantageous for uh separation or storage application, it takes time to actually synthesize that material or it might not be possible to synthesize that material. So um taking feasibility into account when doing these um these uh sort of computational uh predictions. Um we also I uh identified the the need for training sets for machine learning approaches. So um uh sufficient characterization data under the dynamic operating conditions that a lot of these um sorbents uh work under um is needed uh for for this. Um we also talked about some of the challenges with scale up so so lab scale experiments and synthesis versus application scale. Um so things that you consider to be in operando on the lab scale might not truly represent your application scale um conditions. I think this was touched on in some other groups. Um so degradation processes and reversibility or cyclability issues for the um the sorbents that you know adsorb and then we want to release the CO2 at like the storage or conversion um area. A lot of these sorbents function at non equilibrium conditions so might eventually break down. Um some of these degradation products might be sort of the active materials in the storage or catalysis that you're doing. Um and then I think this point kind of goes back into the modeling where we need to understand what the uncertainties are in the model uh uh predictions in order to um you know apply them in a useful way. Also interfaces are key in these uh sort of material applications but hard to understand. So interfaces is where most of the action happens but it's it's all these complex processes occur. The interfacial structure is dynamic and different than bulk structure and therefore hard to characterize. Um we also talked about some underexplored sort of physical phenomena related to um CO2 separation and storage um in this uh sort of the area of sorbents. We talked about light or using light or electrochemistry or humidity swings to trigger desorption might be sort of new um axes to think about um in this context. Um for storage, we talked about CO2 mineralization and some physical phenomena that needed to kind of understand or accelerate that process um or better understandings of precipitation and dissolution dissolution phenomena both sort of solid liquid so at the solid liquid um interface when you're um sort of forming these sort of solid minerals and at the liquid gas interface when you're actually dissolving CO2 into your liquid um sorbent. We also talked about um some interesting ideas about mining coupling mineralization with mining of valuable elements. And then finally we talked about some design criteria to keep in mind when when thinking about these things. So thermal conductivity especially if um you know the heats of adsorption and desorption are playing a role in the sorbents, electrical conductivity for the electrochemical materials, transparency if we're talking about using uh light as a trigger. Um materials that can accommodate self healing or assisted healing processes. Um and then just taking a lot of knowledge from the catalysis community um that they've developed about um adsorption and desorption and sort of balancing the energetics of those two processes and to inform the design of materials for um I think thinking about sorbents again in this case. So I think that sums up a lot of what we talked about.

utterance:  Kandis Leslie (CU Boulder): Yes. Um so hello everyone. Um I go by Leslie which is my middle name and I'm assistant professor at UC Riverside and I'm thankful for the conversations that we had um with our participants and the facilitator Jordy and George. Um so we talked about methane capture and valorization and one of the initial um starts of the conversation was what are the potential emitters or missions. Um and so we're thinking agricultural sites, um fossil fuels of course is a major emitter. Um but then also we have methane in the atmosphere. And so is it really conducive to uh try to capture um if we're going for negative emissions methane out of the atmosphere and you know how would that work? Will we work from point sources or do we work from dilute sources. And um it seems like we had agreement that maybe point sources would be the best option. However, um even if we try to um develop some sort of technology that can take methane from these point sources, they're actually pretty dilute in terms of they have a lot of variability um where you can have a few PPMs of methane to hundreds of PPM um for example at agricultural sources. And then there's other mediations um for removing methane um of for example from cows and that's changing their diets and and um other technological innovations like having them wear a mask or something. Um but if we talk about uh developing technological solutions that we can eventually implement here with the um people that are within this group, um we talked about a lot of different things and I say that you can probably divide it into three. So it's leaving the chemistry of methane alone, the molecule which is naturally nonpolar and then doing something with that maybe changing the pressure or temperature to try to store it. Um the second is trying to make it more reactive. And so we talked about the idea of reactive capture. And then the last thing um is actually taking inspiration from nature so using microbes. And so um the I'll go along this list of possible solutions. One of the first ones was why don't we just oxidize methane all the way to CO2. Um and even though it sounds like it might be counter intuitive, we could potentially possibly integrate this in direct air capture um technology.

On the other hand it was pointed out to me that there is an advantage of having two because you can have the two people confer at the end to make sure that they have extracted what are the main bullet points and if you have a person who's going to be reporting out they're already looking at the notes of the person who's recording all the weeds and then being able to pull out the ideas at a higher level.

utterance:  Wilson Smith (NREL/CU): Sure. One of the things that I've been trying to understand and struggling with that I think we can all benefit from given the urgency and the timeline we need to solve the problem is translating mechanisms in general but here for electrochemical CO2 reduction translating them from a lab scale to where we envision how things will be used at a larger scale. And there's issues with materials durability and functionality and then operational conditions. If we're running either computations or experiments at a really atomic level a lot of the computations are done in vacuum or with little amounts of solvent because it's so computationally intensive to do these things and then we want to be able to translate that to then how does that help us design an electrolyzer that's 100 megawatts or something. And so there's a lot of steps in between and I'm always concerned that a mechanism we find in the lab may not be the same mechanism that will be used for and so kind of closing that loop and there's a value to all of that. We need the basic science to understand the mechanisms but I think we need the input and the boundary conditions that we envision a technology that doesn't exist. We don't have a 100 megawatt electrolyzer to look at durability. We have to learn fast about other fields like fuel cells and electrolyzers water electrolyzers and start to put those boundary conditions and even operational parameters on more fundamental work because the mechanisms will change and I don't think we have the time to figure out a mechanism at one scale take 40 50 years to make that work there. I think we need to close that loop as soon as possible.

utterance:  Aleksandra Vojvodic: Yeah I think this is very very important how to bridge the scales and the understanding. So I just want to bring up one thing that I thought was very informative building off of what you just said and that was so I was in a meeting just a couple of weeks ago actually where the topic was mechanisms of surface reactions. And the chair very provocatively basically opened up and said do we honestly need to know all of the mechanisms at the atomic scale for us to make things to work? Which all of us were a little bit shaken by because that's kind of what we do for a living right. So we of course want to know as you pointed out we really want to know what is happening at the atomic scale but is it actually necessary? So I want to just kind of continue building off of your discussion is it actually necessary of course the chemical industry is out there and a lot of it does not have any or very little understanding of the actual mechanisms. So how this is exactly to your point do we need to know it how do we do the feedback loops and what is the actual knowledge that is necessary?

And so if one were to start thinking about actually implementing some of these CO2 chemistries that we've all been working on which are very well studied and established then maybe Wilson can tell us what is an operational temperature that one should shoot for and let's try to think about studying these mechanism under those conditions.

utterance:  Wilson Smith (NREL/CU): That's a great question and it's so big so to bring in process systems engineering generally putting several processes together some may be exothermic some endothermic a question to start with is is there a benefit to using some waste heat somewhere in a process to help the conversion process. It might be better I think to use the heat for the capture process from some of the discussions having the past few days in terms of concentrating CO2 but I think the general idea of process integration is is key because the outlet of one thing is the inlet for another thing and that means

utterance:  Wilson Smith: mass, that means power, that means heat. So it's a really good point and and right now we don't even know how a CO2 electrolyzer would fit in a large uh system, you know, is it coupled to a DAC or to a point source? Uh are we making a final product or making an intermediate that needs to go to a thermal process after that.

utterance:  Gary F. Moore: I I didn't want to derail the conversation with semantics, but this came up somewhat yesterday in our conversation too and and addressing this sort of provocative question of do we need to know every mechanism? I think it's also fair to ask, can we know any mechanism? And the sort of one mantra in catalysis is we don't know mechanisms, we propose mechanisms that are consistent with the available data and I guess their usefulness really then is in their predictive power. That is that if the the model or catalytic mechanisms allow us to make predictions, then they're useful and going back to Wilson's sort of question, I I guess if that mechanism that's developed at the bench scale at research for a well studied system in uh very stringent conditions, how well does that apply as you begin to uh make your system more complex or scale up to industrial scales is is is a really fair and good question to ask and I I I guess it it depends on how useful those models are at making predictions.

utterance:  Emily Carter: Fine, if I can jump in for just a second. say that, you know, that as Gary and I we had this conversation yesterday and that, you know, you can't ever prove a mechanism, you can only disprove mechanisms and and that's certainly true. However, what you can get from mechanisms is is predictions that then can be tested uh by well characterized experiments and then once you have that done, the thing that's interesting from from, you know, what you learn from understanding the mechanism is what what is the rate limiting step and how can you uh think about optimizing the system further in order to make it more efficient. And so I think that efficient or selective or or or what have you. So there are really good reasons for looking at mechanisms. It certainly is true that a lot of the, you know, processes in um in the chemical industry are Edison and uh and so, you know, we so I think to to Wilson's point though is is really important to and this came up yesterday in a different context too that that I guess in the plenary when we were having the discussion after the plenary, um that it's really important to think about these um the practical constraints um as a way to then dial go back and say, okay, if I put that constraint on my system, um then what does that also tell me about what I want to study?

utterance:  Aleksandra Vojvodic: Yeah, but absolutely like we can measure to certain extent elementary steps or certain elementary steps and study those if they are, you know, slow enough so to speak, right? But bringing it all together is is a totally different question, right? So I think it's as we're building up these important complex systems, it's as you point out Emily and others in here as well, right? It's not only about the activity, which a lot of the computational studies have focused on. It is also about the selectivity and the stability and the evolution and the dynamics, which is something that frankly we have we're ignoring, not because we we are not interested in the topics, but it's just because it's challenging as as Wilson pointing out, right?

utterance:  Charles McCrory: Okay, wrong microphone. But okay. Um, so I guess um, all I was going to say is that um, um, when we're thinking about all these mechanistic studies that we're doing and and and this is going back to what's already been said. But a lot of times even experimentally we're looking at things, you know, in aqueous or non aqueous conditions where we're limiting the CO2 delivery that's limiting the relative reaction rates of proton of hydrogen evolution versus CO2 reduction. When you go to an MEA electrolyzer with the GDE, everything is very different. Do some of the things we even care about matter at that scale?

utterance:  Charles McCrory: But my point is what's really would be really useful is a design of a test bed type reactor that would be accepted by the community where people could plug in different catalysts, membranes, polymers, etc and then use that to test things out under practical conditions, whatever the community defines those practical conditions to be. That's a really important point. It was exactly what the solar fuels hub was supposed to do. I don't know if you were around for that. Uh, but you know, didn't happen. So, but I do think if if there were enough, you know, famous people in CO2 reduction that came together and said, this is the type of test bed that run do your mechanistic studies, do all your measurements under whatever conditions you want, but then with the this geometry under these conditions with these flow rates of CO2, you know, and and water in this flow system, this is what you should be operating at to determine, you know, what your product selectivity is or these are the conditions you do to measure your relative selectivities and therefore you can get kinetic and mechanistic information from that.

utterance:  Aleksandra Vojvodic: I mean, there was you know, out of that came at least the water oxidation and hydrogen evolution protocols that I know Charles was part of of developing so that we at least have a common, you know, scale and common metrics.

utterance:  Charles McCrory: Uh we we engaged with some of the stakeholders in the community and we came up with it based on some metrics that were dictated sort of by the the Jcap proposal by higher up. Um, but but I have a lot of concern about doing metrics. One thing that came out of the benchmarking metrics was that people started gaming the system and basically the entire a flood of HEO papers came in where it was just it was very Edison. We mixed these together and we put them on a high surface area support and everything looks wonderful and we met this benchmarking criterion, which that was not the purpose of the benchmarking.

utterance:  Charles McCrory: Um, so so I'm I'm really concerned about this idea of having metrics that we're trying to achieve with CO2 because I think that what you're going to end up with is a bunch of people mixing things together under certain conditions just to hit benchmarks and it's just going to be there's not going to be any knowledge gained.

It's probably to figure out several test bed in different at at different scales, you know, so that people who work on fundamental science can have one test bed who work on the small scale industrial uh scale can have another etc. So uh that's my two points on this.

utterance:  Pratik Dholabhai: Yeah, hi. Not trying to change the topic, but I was trying to look think of more of a from a material perspective.

Is there any opportunity? This is again, I don't know know some of these things. Is there any opportunity to explore newer materials? Let's say oxide heterostructures. I have seen oxides having a lot of different kind of properties. Are we uh already fixed on okay, this is the material we are going to use and somehow try to fashion or you know, maybe the kinetics are better or the reaction, you know, rates are better or there is opportunity to also look at novel materials that could achieve something similar or maybe at a faster rate or is there something there? That's I do not know that.

Others other metals, like all metals almost can have some kind of a product distribution starting with CO2. The question is what is the ultimate product that we're interested in, right? So if our target is to make something else that that what what copper is doing, maybe there are other opportunities as well in in terms of actually looking at other materials. So just just keeping that in mind, I think it's something that the community is really targeting a lot finding something that can replace or improve copper for that specific purpose to do the exact chemistry that copper is able to do. But if we're interested in making, I don't know, I'm just going to take something out of the air, you know, um a hydrocarbon instead, not that we would want that, but just as an example, there are other alternatives, right? So just just bringing that up that from a mechanistic point of view, I think that uh there are a lot of opportunities as well.

utterance:  Caleb Hill: Yeah, um so with regards to like materials discovery, was that kind of brought up, right? Um a goal of actually understanding the reaction mechanisms would be you have to actually you you have a basis for pursuing some sort of rational materials design. Um but the problem especially with like true materials or heterogeneous catalysts is that you're not dealing with a defined catalyst structure, right? You're dealing with at a practical level millions of independent little structures in the system at an interface that are driving a reaction, will have different binding energies, will have different performances and stuff. So to me that starts to become more of an experimental challenge of how you actually differentiate what's going on within those types of complex interfaces. So something that I would just kind of point out and ask is like if there was a holy grail type experiment that you could perform to understand really and probe and test some of these different reaction mechanisms experimentally, um what would it be? And what would you actually need to do? Do you have to get down to probing individual reactive sites at an interface or what?

utterance:  Wilson Smith: We can do a lot of this with um vibrationalscopy.

So a combination of thesescopy under operating conditions is is a challenge to be able to do this because you know, you can imagine if you're aqueous system and you're evolving gases, that's going could have interference with with light and transport issues. So it's there's a technical challenge, but um there's a there's a few chemical techniques that can give this quantifiable information.

utterance:  Gary F.

But once you go to these heterogenized systems, like in some ways relates to this point you were bringing up earlier about how much does that apply what we know uh for these well defined systems when we go to heterogeneous materials, how do the mechanisms change and how do the rate limiting step change or are the rate limiting steps of catalysis even relevant when you have issues of mass transfer or electron transport or things of that nature, but it's a tough a tough challenge.

utterance:  Aleksandra Vojvodic: Other other comments on the how to probe the heterogeneity of of a heterogeneous catalyst material basically. I mean, ultimately we know that there is one or multiple active sites, right? How they're distributed, how many, where and what they're doing and then their competition with all of the other chemical processes that are taking place is obviously something that is I mean there are very few reactions that that has actually been done where we started with well defined crystals all the way up to something realistic that actually can be put in a real chemical reactor. I mean right the the ammonia synthesis, the N2 reduction comes to to mind, right? Where we actually know what the active site is and it has been proven that even though if you have very complex systems that is still the active site even if they are still in a I mean the active sites tend to be a minority sites um unfortunately. So um just just keeping that in mind. We want a lot of them, but they're still in minority. So we're wasting a lot of material, of course. Um

utterance:  Eva Nichols: Hello, thanks. Uh so I have a few points I wanted to mention uh just in in response to a lot of these comments. Uh the first is that I've heard a lot of discussion about uh you know, development of the catalyst. Uh but I think we've also learned that the reaction conditions can be just as important if not more important. And so I would be really interested, you know, to maybe map that space out much more in depth than it has been mapped out. Um you know, all of these sort of high throughput screens of different metal alloys or different ways to excuse me, combine uh materials to make the electro catalyst are useful for sure. Uh but but I think we need um larger screens as well of, you know, ions that are present or of the electrolyte of the solvent of all of the different reaction conditions that go into this. Um so so that's one thing. Um and then to the provocative statement of whether we really need mechanistic information. Um I'm not excited to say this, but I think maybe I would I would hazard a guess and say no, not always. Um because as you pointed out in in the chemical industry a lot of times I think those conditions had been uh determined just based on a large number of experimental uh attempts, right? And then people found what worked the best. So maybe that's what we need in this case as well just as Charles mentioned determine a system that will uh be potentially practically useful and then try a lot of these high throughput screens uh there and whether or not we completely understand everything uh on a mechanistic level may not matter uh given the time scale we need to make these changes.

Um and the fact that uh it's it's awesome as Wilson pointed out that we can look at ensembles of of intermediates for example or of species on surfaces, but most of the time that's done under steady state conditions. And so I think it's really limiting our ability, you know, it's nice to make claims that this is useful and and I think it definitely is useful in part, but uh those are not short-lived intermediates and you don't get kinetic information by doing things at steady state.

utterance:  Emily Carter: Yeah, those are great points, all of them.

Uh and that's that's just a much more challenging problem. It doesn't, you know, it's it's it's something that certainly has been tackled in the gas phase and and uh and you know, should be tackled in the condensed phase as well ultimately.

utterance:  Emily Carter: Right, and you mentioned the chemical industry and and I um I used to uh when I was a graduate student, so eons ago, um my work was supported by Shell development and um and so and I used to visit there and so they used to call this matrix chemistry that you basically, you know, you have different reaction conditions on on two axes and you just map out all possible ones. So it's it was a very crude way of doing, you know, high throughput screening back then and that's how they optimized uh conditions.

utterance:  Aleksandra Vojvodic: Yeah, but I think, you know, one thing that can that we can apply on everything, especially computationally kind of is the comment. Like you've all a lot of you have commented on the high throughput studies, right? They can only take us that far, but then to actually include all of that complexity that we're talking about is truly needed. That is where the actual development on the computational side is needed. So we are still lacking a lot of the computational tools for those for us to study those processes. So there's like a big big opportunity within those spaces as well. I mean, we've talked about the development of experimental tools, but it's just as equally important, I think to develop some of the computational tools, especially if they're fast enough to study some of these some of these processes that we're talking about. But it the question in the end that I find the most well, among the more interesting one is, what is the level of complexity that a computational system or a model system needs to have for me to be able to represent in quotation mark real real system. And I don't know the answer because as you as you pointed out, Eva, it's it's a question of how do all of those local effects, those local environments, the operating conditions, how are they actually changing at given system? And we don't know the answer to that. So it kind of to have that computational prediction, we need to have some kind of a benchmark with at least one system experimentally. So having that first step, I think is I mean there are groups that are working on this, of course. So I I'm I think that there'll be a lot of really interesting things coming out, but how can we do this faster is the other thing that is of course the the clock is ticking. Um but it just coming back to the short-lived intermediates was one one thing that I wanted to mention. I mean, there are there are tools. I mean, the a lot of the national labs are having x-ray capabilities and some of them are developing tools to probe some of these short-lived species in aqueous environments actually. So I think that is something that is really, really cool if we can really uh truly get get to that at some point. Um um any other thoughts? What else have did you jot down that we might not have covered so far or any comments on what anybody else has said so far? Wilson, I think Ashleigh, go ahead.

So, you know, what kind of contributions can model systems add to better understanding active sites. And it's been touched on a bit that um Alex how you just mentioned there are some national labs that are doing um not not only um experiments in aqueous solutions but also in an electrochemical cell.

utterance:  Aleksandra Vojvodic: glue an actual answer together. He's kind of how I'm envisioning this, right? So each and one of us are working on maybe the same problem, but we're bringing a specific answer to the bigger question. So how is that done? And of course, it's not only you contributing with something in me, it's also what is that small, small overlaps that what you're predicting or finding and what I'm doing actually overlap so that we have some kind of an agreement.

utterance:  Andrea Hicks: Um, the only thing that might actually be somewhat relevant contributing is way earlier, um, Pratik, you and Emily were talking about, you know, finding new materials and do we need new materials.

But to suddenly use a lot of copper in a lot of deployments, although copper is relatively abundant, we also use it for a lot of other things. So then we get to these weird bottlenecks of like electrical wires versus um these carbon technologies. So that's one another area of why we might think about um innovating new materials. You know, it's thinking about, well, you know, it's the same with like the ethanol food corn debate that's been around forever of we just need to think about what else we're doing with these and if that's going to cause issues. And I know that's tangentially related, but you can tell I mainly do like life cycle assessment and not these things.

utterance:  Emily Carter: and it it comes back to what I said yesterday in the plenary session about becks about bioenergy. We we tend it's not like we're not using these plants for other things or these trees for other things, you know, we make paper and and all all sort and we for building materials and things like that. So as you there are many examples of this and you brought up the the corn ethanol um example as well. And and so I agree. I think as scientists and engineers are moving ahead in these in these directions, it's really important to think about the life cycle analysis and understand the abundance. Now, from a, you know, there's a lot of people on this call that are have chemistry backgrounds and so what we what uh chemists tend to think about is abundance of the of the of the element and and pat ourselves on the back that we're not using iridium, okay?

utterance:  Andrea Hicks: But in general, they're not economically worth recovering because there's not enough in any sort of concentrated form unless you were maybe thinking about like the heat sinks. Um and so that gets interesting too. Whenever we're embedding something in a matrix and it's like at a relatively low concentration, often it's not economically or environmentally like viable to recover it from something. And so that's when it gets into like this interesting point of it needs to be designed actually so you can recover it or it has to be enough in it to make it um economical to recover.

utterance:  Aleksandra Vojvodic: But well, I think that just adding to this uh, you know, the the aspects that we don't typically think about the the the human aspect.

Like these things that actually all have like engineering or physical or chemical numbers that we can put on. But how do you then actually, you know, quantify the impact on a society that is dealing with this waste uh and these type of things are never or very rarely talked about and put any we don't put any numbers on them. And you know, people tend to say, well, there is an impact, but how big is the impact really or how big is the is the, you know, how large of a problem is it actually? So there are actually uh a couple of people that I know of that are trying to, you know, introduce uh metrics for these type of things that we as engineers and scientists don't typically think about, right? What is the human impact and the problem that we're that we're contributing to.

Um, you know, like top down, bottom up kind of solvents and because sometimes like what we think is a green solvent isn't. Uh there's a paper that came out a couple years ago out of Northeastern where one of them was using like this potato starch.

You know and this isn't known in the in the in the electrochemical and engineering field and the idea we started developing is that we could potentially also induce polymer breakdown with some really clever chemical tuning of the reaction environment.

utterance:  Wilson Smith: Um, so thanks Richard. Thanks to the team. We had a really great discussion. Unfortunately, we took the same question and answered it completely differently. Um, so you know, one of the pervasive themes that we had through our discussion was in terms of mechanisms of electrochemical CO2 reduction, do we even need to know the mechanism? And and this discussion was came out of um, how the chemical process industry has developed prior to this with a lot of Edison type experiments where they build things and maybe do a kind of um, high throughput or some kind of screening at a relevant industrial scale to find operational conditions or not. And so it's an open question of do we first need to understand mechanisms at an atomic lab scale. Um, and then if those do translate, um, we need to make that translation clear because both computationally and experimentally, um, looking at mechanisms are typically done on well defined surfaces or well defined systems with, you know, probably not a lot of flow or or or um mass transport. But if we look at what this technology would potentially need to be at a high TRL, um, probably the conditions would be very, very different and the mechanisms would probably change. And this has implications for both the materials, so materials durability, um, and selectivity requirements changing as a function of operation conditions, um, degradation modes will probably be different, you know, flooding happens at at larger scales and salt formations which may not need to be dealt with at the lab scale. So, um, it's the kind of the two prong question of do we need to wait or even to say, do we even have the time to wait and look at this from the atomic scale up and take every step there, or can we learn from some of the previous chemical process industry to see um, we need kind of the large scale testing and assessment there to feed the relevant conditions into the the fundamental science. So we recognize the need for both the applied and fundamental work, but I think one of the key messages is that we need that feedback loop to be much quicker and more direct and lean on what's been done with with other even electrochemical technologies. Um, you know, part of that was, you know, defining a lot of our questions here aren't even specific to CO2, they're in general for electrochemical reactions and um, you know, then figuring out if we need to translate something, what we can probe and what we need to probe. So there's a lot of um, spectroscopic and spectro electrochemical technique techniques that give kind of an averaging or an ensemble effect over a heterogeneous surface, um, and that we lose information about single sites and single atoms and how they react. And I think both of those can be useful in in determining uh what how we need to develop large scale um electrolyzer.

utterance:  Carlos Morales Guio: I think um maybe I think based on um Smith's discussion seems to to understand copper is kind of very special at the moment seems copper is a magic material uh heterogeneous uh counted for CC band formation uh seems we need I don't know I I you know uh you know Smith uh his group seems we don't need to make make the understanding but for copper seems it can be uh it's a big mystery here and uh I we think we need more understanding about copper this material it's a magic material at least at the moment. So as part of the first year of the silo we have developed a gas tight rotating cylinder electrode cell where we put the model uh copper polyline copper electrode and we rotate it at different uh rates and as you rotate it even though you have the same potential you actually start to see dramatic changes in in selectivity. We already uh also we have the preprint in in our website. So what we see is that actually mass transport controls selectivity and the the the problem is a little bit more complex. So you actually have a lot of uh CO that is the main reaction intermediate that dissolves and hangs around near the surface of the electrode long enough. So they near the surface of the electrode it actually behaves as a sort of CSTR a continuous stirred tank reactor and then uh what happens is that we get a lot of high uh conversion of CO and uh theory is trying to do a lot of mechanistic understanding of of those systems actually on under high uh conversion of CO and uh typically you don't.

utterance:  Carlos Morales Guio: study kinetics and under those conditions, right? But now that I think we have a good system, right? A reactor that you can control mass transport and see the influence of mass transport in electrocatalysis. I think now what we see is that we can actually understand the mechanism of CO2 reduction on copper much easily. It makes a lot of sense and then what you have in gas diffusion electrodes is essentially a system where the residence time of carbon monoxide is very long. So once you have a system that has very long residence time for carbon monoxide, then you start to look at it more sort of as a plug flow reactor. So long story short, I think the challenge was to get an electrochemical cell that allows you to control mass transport and at the same time allows you to do product quantification and detection. Um, so I think we have accomplished that through and I think that that that should open the the door to scale up these systems.

utterance:  Richard Wiener: Excellent. Uh, thank you Carlos and uh folks can pursue more discussion with Carlos and some of these other points uh in the slack channel or on chat.

utterance:  Greeshma Gadikota: Hi everyone. Um, my name is Greeshma Gadikota and I'm going to be uh reporting um for our team. I'd like I'm very grateful for David's support and for our facilitators Chris and Ellen as well as our excellent participants. So there were several aspects that came up uh over the course of our discussion uh particularly in the context of the need for DAC. Um, so one of the nice things about direct air capture is that it can be deployed independently of point source emissions and as we continue as we continue to use fossil fuels, there is going to be an increased need for DAC particularly from sectors that are challenging to decarbonize such as transportation. You're going to need DAC to clean up emissions from uh such sectors. Uh one of the interesting things that came up over the course of our discussion was the fact that there is considerable geographical variability in resources and how that might actually impact the deployment of CO2 capture and DAC technologies. So for example, if you're in regions of the world where uh moisture contents are different or in certain locations where the compositions of air are even different, separation technologies will need to be tailored for such regions. Uh this is a challenge but it's also an opportunity because it locks it it helps us unlock many fresh ideas and innovations in the context of DAC. Uh and perhaps you can take some of that understanding and translate that for CO2 capture as well from diverse set of um emissions. So with that said, our team uh sees the challenge of variability of compositions as something that can actually unlock more innovation. So we think it's actually a positive in the context of um innovating in this space. We also think that understanding durability, economic costs and incentive structures are crucial under real world operating conditions. And this actually goes back to the point that uh Carlos had made about uh the need for molecular scale science as well as the process scale engineering to come together to inform economic costs and incentive structure incentive structures. So there so really there is a need for cross scale thinking in this particular line of work. Uh this line this approach may be unconventional for some of the other research areas but in this area it is crucially needed. Uh another important consideration uh which is unique to DAC is that we need to consider the end fate of CO2 and that would really dictate where we would actually put or implement DACs that CO2 going to be stored underground, is it going to be coupled to utilization, is it going to be coupled to mineralization, in which case the kind of DAC technology that would get deployed might need to get customized. And also this part of the question of uh CO2 conversion to products and our team took the view that CO2 conversion to products is insufficient from the perspective of climate. We wrapped up our discussion from a rather big picture perspective of where DAC and CO2 capture are headed. And so when we look at industrial decarbonization, we're starting to see that there is defossilization of crucial commodities like ammonia, even cement and construction materials. This is something that's going to get realized over the course of the next 10 to 20 years or so. So in this context of defossilization, what is going to be the emerging role of DAC and CO2 capture? It's an open ended question but that is where we choose to wrap up our discussion. So thank you for the opportunity to present.

utterance:  Kelsey Hatzell: Yeah, thanks. Hi, uh my name is Kelsey Hatzell. I'm going to be reporting out on carbon caption in addition to DAC. Um, so um our revision too. Um, we took a little bit of a different perspective from the previous group and looked at a little bit more of the upscale challenge. Um, uh, I think the previous group kind of articulated that uh there's opportunity for DAC to be um uh operate uh independent of point of source um applications. Um, one of the things that was pretty like well established thought process that we talked in great detail was um the value proposition of combining point source um treatment with DAC. Um, given the fact that a lot of the infrastructure can be repurposed um and having that onsite is going to be potentially an economic advantage for that approach.

utterance:  Richard Wiener RCSA: not, we will go to group and I think there's more discussion that folks will want to follow up on outside of the this session, but um, group 2.3 and that's materials for separation and storage and uh, it looks like Ellen or Katie are reporting.

utterance:  Katie Knowles (U. Rochester): Yeah, so I'm Katie Knowles, I'll be sort of reporting out what we did based on the sort of detailed notes that Ellen took uh during our discussion. And so um, so we're talking about uh materials for separation and storage and uh we talked a lot about the challenges for materials discovery and development. And I think some of these um are continuing on some themes that were discussed in other groups. So gaps between computational predictions and experiments, the fact that like if um you know if a computational study identifies a new material that might be um advantageous for uh separation or storage application, it takes time to actually synthesize that material or it might not be possible to synthesize that material. So um taking feasibility into account when doing these um these uh sort of computational uh predictions. Um we also I uh identified the the need for training sets for machine learning approaches. So um uh sufficient characterization data under the dynamic operating conditions of a lot of these um sorbents uh work under um is needed uh for for this. Um, we also talked about some of the challenges with scale up. So so lab scale experiments and synthesis versus application scale. Um, so things that you consider to be in operando on the lab scale might not truly represent your application scale um conditions. I think this was touched on in some other groups. Um, so degradation processes and reversibility or cyclability issues for the um the sorbents that you know absorb and then we want to release the CO2 at like the storage or conversion um area. A lot of these sorbents function at non-equilibrium conditions, so might eventually break down. Um, some of these degradation products might be sort of the active materials in the storage or catalysis that you're doing. Um, and then I think this point kind of goes back into the modeling where we need to understand what the uncertainties are in the model uh uh predictions in order to um you know apply them in a useful way. Also interfaces are key in these uh sort of material applications but hard to understand. So interfaces is where most of the action happens, but it's it's all these complex processes occur. The interfacial structure is dynamic and different than bulk structure and therefore hard to characterize. Um, we also talked about some underexplored sort of physical phenomena related to um CO2 separation and storage. Um, in this uh sort of the area of sorbents, we talked about light or using light or electrochemistry or humidity swings to trigger desorption might be sort of new um axes to think about um in this context. Um, for storage, we talked about CO2 mineralization and some physical phenomena that needed to kind of understand or accelerate that process um or better understandings of precipitation and dissolution phenomena both sort of solid liquid, so at the solid liquid um interface when you're um sort of forming these sort of solid minerals and at the liquid gas interface when you're actually dissolving CO2 into your liquid um sorbent. We also talked about um some interesting ideas about mining coupling mineralization with mining of valuable elements. And then finally we talked about some design criteria to keep in mind when when thinking about these things. So thermal conductivity, especially if um, you know, the heats of adsorption and desorption are playing a role in the sorbents, electrical conductivity for the electrochemical materials, transparency, if we're talking about using uh light as a trigger, um materials that can accommodate self-healing or assisted healing processes. Um, and then just taking a lot of knowledge from the catalysis community um that they've developed about um adsorption and desorption and sort of balancing the energetics of those two processes and to inform the design of materials for um I think thinking about sorbents again in this case. So I think that sums up a lot of what we talked about.

utterance:  Kandis Leslie (UC Riverside): Yes. Um, so hello everyone. Um, I go by Leslie, which is my middle name and I'm a assistant professor at UC Riverside and I'm thankful for the conversations that we had um with our participants and the facilitator, Jordi and George. Um, so we talked about methane capture and valorization and one of the initial um starts of the conversation was what are the potential emitters or emissions. Um, and so we're thinking agricultural sites, um, fossil fuels of course is a major emitter. Um, but then also we have methane in the atmosphere. And so is it really conducive to uh try to capture um if we're going for negative emissions methane out of the atmosphere and you know, how would that work? Would we work from point sources or do we work from dilute sources. And um, it seems like we had agreement that maybe point sources would be the best option. However, um, even if we try to um develop some sort of technology that can take methane from these point sources, they're actually pretty dilute in terms of they have a lot of variability, um, where you can have a few PPMs of methane to hundreds of PPM, um, for example at agricultural sources. And then there's other mediations um for removing methane, um, uh for example from cows and and that's changing their diets and and um other technological innovations like having the mask or something. Um, but if we talk about uh developing technological solutions that we can eventually implement here with the um people that are within this group, um, we talked about a lot of different things and I say that you can probably divide it into three. So it's leaving the chemistry of methane alone, the molecule, which is naturally nonpolar and then doing something with that, maybe changing the pressure or temperature to try to store it. Um, the second is trying to make it more reactive. And so we talked about the idea of reactive capture. And then the last thing um is actually taking inspiration from nature, so using microbes. And so um, the I'll go along this list of possible solutions. One of the first ones was why don't we just oxidize methane all the way to CO2. Um, and even though it sounds like it might be counterintuitive, it still will get the ball rolling because we have existing technology for um direct air capture that we can possibly utilize in combination with some sort of oxidation of methane scheme.

utterance:  Dimitar Sasselov: Um I at some point may try to kind of channel Sarah. I know quite a bit about her research. I was even on her PhD committee many years ago and she's done many more exciting things. And I may try to um uh kind of put in um our discussion a few of the ideas she might have wanted to discuss about information as being uh one way to look at life and understanding the phenomenon of life in most general terms. Information that copies itself and that makes structures that makes itself. So it's a very interesting concept that it may help us look for it. But we can do that later in that discussion. We have an hour and something uh to discuss all these things. So shall we start from the chemistry, which is one way to do it or shall we start from the other side, which is the astronomy astronomy? So we can also do astrochemistry, of course, but uh um since we have a few chemists here, what do the chemists think?

utterance:  Aaron Engelhart: Just getting into it quickly that the few things I had written down is that um you know, this this kind of comes directly from the questions but water, you know, we think of it as so central to life, but like it's worth considering other solvents, you know, like if we're thinking about Titan or methane or other things like that. And I think that per Dimitar's comment about um, you know, how is this even relevant to life on earth? I think that the other solvent question could be relevant to life on earth because, you know, from some of uh for instance like McHugh's work, uh there's been work on kind of hypersaline environments and alternative solvents that come from a lot of solute from an aqueous solution that when you concentrate it, you have something that's still liquid that you can do interesting chemistry in.

utterance:  Aaron Engelhart: Um the third and there's five here just you know where I am on this. And um is uh you know, thinking about prebiotic chemistry. I think we think of it as something that happened and then there was life. But I think that it's worth considering it as we think of these questions as kind of a progress bar for the emergence of life, you know, we go from low complexity to kind of what Dimitar is talking about higher complexity. Um and I think that that might kind of inform some of our thinking about, you know, we're talking about with exoplanets. Uh and then finally the last two are kind of related. Um there's going to obviously be some geochemical constraints on what kind of protobiomolecules emerge and that's going to vary from body to body. Um and this is going to have uh you know, impacts from a chemical perspective in terms of, you know, what surfaces are presented and what kind of chemistry you can do on the surfaces.

utterance:  Aaron Engelhart: Yeah, absolutely. And I think that um there's some nice work from Lauren Williams about 30 years ago where he showed that um you can get uh nucleoside monomers if they're hydrophobic to base pair in chloroform and you actually don't get base pairing if you take like GMP and CMP and mix them together in water.

utterance:  Laurie Barge: So I I had a bullet that was just kind of a general thought about the state of this field, which is that in so as you know if like in origin of life, there's all these funding sources, but they are really specifically about early earth and it's always about trying to get, you know, at what it was the origin of life on earth. This is true for like the NASA RCNs, exobiology and everything else. And then we have all these planetary science questions about other worlds and life on other worlds, but there is no funding that I've ever found where you could study the possible origin of life on another world in a non-earthlike manner. And so that's that's been a real problem for someone who's interested in life detection like me because, you know, I want to say, well, on Mars for example, could you have life begin in some other way than earth, but you can't really do those experiments. And I think that's a real like issue in in linking these two things. So that's kind of a general thought. And then as far as uh go ahead.

utterance:  Dimitar Sasselov: Well that's good news, but um that's good news. I though I do agree with Laurie though that the funding is hasn't been sufficient in that or the interest I would say in the funding agencies or in the general community.

utterance:  Laurie Barge: It's it's totally possible and like me and all the other chemists I'm sure have thought about different experiments that we would like love to do. And there's things the things I think about are there's all the wild theories of could you have totally alternative life chemistries and maybe. But I also wonder, you know, there could just be main similarities between life here and life on exoplanets, but the but the origin of life was actually different than it was on earth and maybe the initial steps of chemical evolution were different. So it could be carbon based, it could be in water, but it's still not the same as earth. And so there's a lot of experiments that could be done, even big things early on like minerals direct reactions, but how exactly and which minerals are prevalent. And you know, you could imagine like I think on early earth, the redox state of the planet was a huge factor because you have let's say iron two very rich in the oceans and an atmosphere of mostly CO2. And what is the redox state of the atmosphere? What is the redox state of the mantle? Like these are huge drivers for what sort of reactions you might have even with all the same chemicals that we are used to. And so that's the sort of stuff that I think would deserve more experimental investigation that kind of hasn't been done.

So yeah. So like I I think the reason paper, you know, like uh the big publications, they suggest, you know, there could be some serpization process, they have enough methane and some, you know, small organic molecules, organic nitrogen compounds that maybe that the micros will be favorable, you know, using them, right?

And also the modeling would tell us stability of a product at a condition, but it didn't take into account the instability of the molecule, like we were talking about.

utterance:  Kimberly Lau: Can I ask I just mention a follow up to that. So one thing, you know, I think that speaking about these time scales, the other there's a more intermediate time scale of daily cycles or seasonal cycles and UV fluxes and changes over those, there's a balance there between the the positive and the negative parts of UV and I wonder that's something that we can also discuss.

utterance:  Liming Li: Yeah, right. Yeah, I think the photochemistry is very important for the atmosphere, that's no problem for that. Yeah. Of course, the UV, the shorter wavelength radiation is very important because it provides the energy, basically, the strong energy for the chemistry in atmosphere. So actually I want to uh explore the problem from maybe from a different perspective. I think the country, the temperature determination of the exoplanets, basically based on the spectral, the infrared spectral or maybe maybe the distance from the mother star, something like that to estimate the temperature. I think maybe there are some other way to better, you know, determine the temperature. I mean the surface temperature, not the temperature on the top.

utterance:  Liming Li: Basically, if you get the infrared spectrometer get the infrared spectral of the planet, basically you get the temperature, we call the brightness temperature, it's not the temperature on surface, it's the temperature on the top of atmosphere. So if the planet doesn't have atmosphere, that means the temperature will change a lot from daytime to night time. It's not good for life because for example, for for for Mars. Mars the atmosphere is very thin. The temperature, the daytime temperature and night time temperature, the difference can reach a couple of hundred degrees. So for for for but for if the planet have have atmosphere, so you can check the temperature on the top of atmosphere, but the top atmosphere temperature is totally different from the temperature on surface.

utterance:  Liming Li: For example, for earth is is special for earth the the difference temperature difference between surface and the top of atmosphere just a couple of 10 degrees, 20 maybe 30 degrees, not very huge. But if you check uh Venus, if you check Titan, the temperature difference is huge. So that's mean even you're current I mean actually I'm not the expert of exoplanet. I I'm not sure which method they are using to determine the temperature of exoplanets. But by my point even for the planets in our solar system, even for the planets and moons in our solar system, we don't have determine very well the surface temperature. You know, because so uh of course we have some in situ measurements for the mass surface temperature, but if you check the global, I mean global scale temperature, that's other problem. So that's mean what's the radiation budget on the top, what's the radiation transfer inside of atmosphere, then what's the precisely what's the temperature on the surface. I I mean and global scale. That's actually even for Mars, we don't have very good very good knowledge for that. Of course the for the same thing for the Venus, for the Titan, you know for maybe for yeah. So I mean if we if we can figure out one one way to better determine the surface temperature of exoplanets. That I mean it will help help us to find life help us to find liquid water and life and so on. So that's my my idea, you know I'm trying something for the planets in our solar system, not for exoplanets, but I think maybe it's worth of trying for exoplanets.

utterance:  Laurie Barge: I think with with the lab, it's you can do stuff but you have to be really specific in what you choose because you can only do a very small amount of things. So I think I always think it's most important to focus on the non-equilibrium reactions because those are not easy to model and radical chemistry is not easy to solve and anything that's kind of messy I think more easily studied in the lab. So like if planetary scientists could give us, you know, a top five list of things that would be cool to know about, that then we would go do all the experiments, but it's hard to know what to focus on sometimes because you read papers about early earth was like this or Mars is like that and then you do five years of experiments and then it's like no actually the atmosphere is this actually.

utterance:  Laurie Barge: What if we did like, you know, there's if there's a Venn diagram here, one is the conditions because we're we're really trying to answer, could life emerge on other exoplanets, right? So could could exoplanet or planetary science people make a list of which parameters are most variable between different planets, because that would allow you to say which planet could or could not do a thing. And then the chemists could make which parameters are most effective in changing the way a chemical reaction turns out, because you know, certain ones you change in the lab it is not that big of a deal. Other ones you change it, it changes everything. And where that overlap is could be, you know, a shorter list where we could focus in the lab.

That would be a thing to focus on. But then other things like maybe wouldn't.

utterance:  Meredith MacGregor: I mean like one clear thing, right? Like I mean, you know, from an astronomer perspective, UV flux changes dramatically both on short time scales and on long time scales, right? And we can I can measure that for stars that have exoplanets around them, right? So I can give you the UV flux from a star on hours, minutes, hours, days, years, right?

utterance:  Ziming Yang: In particular, I'm interested in organic transformations in the hydrothermal systems, and we conduct some laboratory based, you know, experiments to simulate some conditions, you know, in the deep earth and also maybe beyond the earth, and we try to, you know, examine the pathways, you know, kinetics and mechanisms of the organic transformations under the hydrothermal conditions and also the organic inorganic interactions that related to maybe prebiotic synthesis and origin of life.

utterance:  Dimitar Sasselov: I wrote something myself and just to break the ice, I'll tell you what it is. It's a little bit provocative. So my kind of question for this is if if the main goal of this dialogue is how to find and you know, how to go about finding if there is life beyond earth, why is this topic about the necessary and sufficient conditions for life even relevant at all? Like why even discuss this? So I think Tim Lyons kind of started answering that question, but you know, we have to think about, you know, what are the connections? Maybe that's actually about the complementarity between exoplanet research and origin of life science.

utterance:  Aaron Engelhart: So I have just a few bullet points and um honestly this might be helpful or will be helpful for me because I think that um and uh the the way that I think about this I know isn't the way that you think about it. So just getting into it quickly the the few things I had written down is that um you know, this this kind of comes directly from the questions but water, you know, we think of it as so central to life, but like it's worth considering other solvents, you know, like if we're thinking about Titan or methane or other things like that and I think that per Dimitar's comment about um, you know, how is this even relevant to life on earth? I think that the other solvent question could be relevant to life on earth because, you know, from some of uh for instance like Nick Hud's work, uh there's been work on kind of hypersaline environments and alternative solvents that come from a lot of solute from an aqueous solution that when you concentrate it, you have something that's still liquid that you can do interesting chemistry in. Um the third and there's five here just so you know where I am on this. um is uh, you know, thinking about prebiotic chemistry. I think we think of it as something that happened and then there was life, but I think that it's worth considering it as we I think of these questions as kind of a progress bar for the emergence of life, you know, we go from low complexity to kind of what Dimitar was talking about higher complexity. Um and I think that that might kind of inform some of our thinking about, you know, we're talking about with exoplanets. Uh and then finally the last two are kind of related. Um there's going to obviously be some geochemical constraints on what kind of protobiomolecules emerge and that's going to vary from body to body. Um and this is going to have uh, you know, impacts from a chemical perspective in terms of, you know, what surfaces are presented and what kind of chemistry you can do on those surfaces as well as and this kind of ties into the geochemistry, um, you know, temperature and pressure. I think that there are environments that are close enough to an earthlike environment where the chemistry could be quite similar, you know, like Mars, you're at, you know, a few millibar. I think most of the same stuff can be done there, but if you're thinking about a high pressure environment, that can have pretty profound effects on folding of biopolymers and there's been experiments done with that. So those are the few things that came to mind for me. Um and uh I'm definitely interested in hearing uh what everyone else has to say about this.

utterance:  Dimitar Sasselov: Um there is a lot to unpack there. So uh maybe we can take it one step at a time.

utterance:  Laurie Barge: I would think it's interesting but it's probably going to be done, but I think the hydrophobic question is is still relevant because you don't have to have the entire solvent be hydrophobic because a lot of life also is taking like the biochemistry of the membrane is different than the biochemistry of the inside of the cell or what would be outside in the geochemical environment. If you look at say the electron transport chain, you've got, you know, hydrophilic type reactions and then suddenly you've got stuff going on that can only really happen not in water.

utterance:  Laurie Barge: So I I had a bullet that was just kind of a general thought about the state of this field, which is that in so as you know if like in origin of life, there's all these funding sources, but they are really specifically about early Earth and it's always about trying to get, you know, at what it was the origin of life on Earth. This is true for like the NASA RCNs, exobiology and everything else. And then we have all these planetary science questions about other worlds and life in other worlds, but there is no funding that I've ever found where you could study the possible origin of life on another world in a non-earth like manner. And so that's that's been a real problem for someone who's interested in life detection like me because, you know, I want to say, well, on Mars, for example, could you have life begin in some other way than Earth, but you can't really do those experiments.

I though I do agree with Laurie though that the funding is hasn't been sufficient in that or the interest, I would say in the funding agencies or in the general community.

utterance:  Laurie Barge: It's it's totally possible and like me and all the other chemists, I'm sure have thought about different experiments that we would like love to do and there's things the things I think about are there's all the wild theories of could you have totally alternative life chemistries and maybe. But I also wonder, you know, there could just be main similarities between life here and life on exoplanets, but the but the origin of life was actually different than it was on Earth and maybe with the initial steps of chemical evolution were different. So it could be carbon based, it could be in water, but it's still not the same as Earth. And so there's a lot of experiments that could be done, even big things early on like minerals direct reactions, but how exactly and which minerals are prevalent and, you know, you could imagine like I think on early Earth, the redox state of the planet was a huge factor because you have let's say iron two very rich in the oceans and an atmosphere of mostly CO2 and what is the redox state of the atmosphere? What is the redox state of the mantle? Like these are huge drivers for what sort of reactions you might have even with all the same chemicals that we are used to. And so that's the sort of stuff that I think would deserve more experimental investigation that kind of hasn't been done.

utterance:  Laurie Barge: There people talk about this for Enceladus because they found those organics in the plume and, you know, there's I know a debate in astronomy, which I'm not as familiar with, so maybe some of you know, but is Enceladus 4 billion years old like the rest of the stuff or is it young and formed with Saturn's rings?

Because this really strikes me listening to all of you talk about this in that, you know, I'm an astronomer. So for me the time scale like point zero starts way back when we initially form a star and a disc and then the disc forms planets and eventually that planet maybe, you know, cools down and has the conditions for life, right?

utterance:  Gongjie Li: And I guess related to this and also on the stability. So I think for the dynamics of this planetary system is the same thing. So if it's too stable and then it may not be able to transfer like water or organic material to the terrestrial planets. And also from the earlier on stage. So it would be interesting to see like what's the chemical distribution along the radius of the system since the temperature difference is really large and the um metallicity or this um um not perhaps not metallicity but just um how the chemical ingredients would mix inside this proto planetary disc and form these planets and then further on how the instability of this planetary system may transfer this um um materials from outside to inside and vice versa and how this will distribute and allow complex life to emerge.

So like, do you need, for example, let's say protein metabolism to happen inside the cell membrane or can that sort of happen outside and then, you know, and so it's hard to know where in the timing that all occurs because no one really knows the order of operations. And the other the other problem from a chemistry perspective is, you know, you look at the vast timeline of Earth and then in the lab you're basically zooming in in in on one little bit and you can do an experiment, but even if you look at the whole origin of life, which is a blip geologically, then even then you're zooming in super thin. And so any experiment that anyone's doing is going to be like this much and then you have to come back out and then you have to come back in at a different point to do the next experiment because it's not it's not just not possible for one person or lab to do the whole origin of life because you have to the time scale just doesn't make sense.

I think there are two processes and they could be like competing process as well, right? Maybe like they're forming the organics, but they're also degrading at the same time.

utterance:  Laurie Barge: This is my latest modeling struggle but like it's an example of what we encounter all the time. And in the lab too you find out that things are just very messy when you start involving geology and so like if you I don't know have a reaction driven by ferrous iron and the ocean had ferrous iron and then you do your with and without salt controls you then find out that there's a different rate when you have 0.5 molar of sodium chloride and on and on it goes. And it's like this for silica phosphorus nitrogen and so you end up having to do just an infinite amount of experiments to really understand what's going on and I don't know if the models are able to predict these things or if maybe just more modeling needs to be done before we do the experiment. But we often get tied up in controls like endless controls just to know because you can't just say the earlier ocean favors formation of molecule you have to do every component of that in the lab and and we just it takes forever.

utterance:  Aaron Engelhart: Another example from our work is that um the we've gotten really interested in the impact of some of the oxychlorine salts on Mars uh in the last few years and um it turns out one thing that having perchlorate and silicates around which are thought to be present you know in a lot of high abundance in the Martian regulath is that um the perchlorate um is of a type of salt that can drive adsorption of RNA and DNA to silicates and it does it reversibly and we're kind of excited about it because it seems like that could be kind of a way to do compartmentalization because these lipid assemblies don't really work very well at high salt.

utterance:  Aaron Engelhart: So, um, I guess I'll start by saying we think about this pretty naively and I don't want to give the impression that we think about this in in more depth than we do just that um, you know, that it is a problem. Um, uh, I guess thinking about it in terms of Mars, which is probably the non-terran body that we think about the most. Um, you know, there are measurements of what's thought to be ancient Mars UV flux and current Mars UV flux based on changes in the atmosphere and the sun. Um, and there are measurements from Dimitar for instance and other labs where they've looked at um, uh, the impact of this on nucleo bases and it can be pretty profound. Um, especially with hard UV, um, you know, it can just degrade the nucleo bases and basically chew them up into smaller molecules or in kind of the more benign uh UVB UVC range, um, you can start to see things like for instance if you have a strand of DNA and if there's two Ts next to each other, there's a reaction that's UV promoted where it'll actually cross link those into a dimer. So all that stuff is going on and that UV that uh UV induced dimer formation that actually happens in living things right now. That's one of the main things that uh repair enzymes have to deal with. So it um that's just kind of what we think about as UV is generally chewing this stuff up and it can cause photochemical reactions that we don't want. That said, um, you know, there's been some work using UV as kind of a plus because it can, you know, you can photochemically promote some of these uh syntheses. But for the most part, uh we kind of think of it as a problem, you know, like assume that we get to the point where we have these monomers because like I said, we kind of live in this space where it's, you know, assume for the sake of argument that we have these molecules, what's going to happen in terms of their assembly, UV is a problem that we always have to deal with. So that's kind of how we think about it.

utterance:  Dimitar Sasselov: So one more diversity factor to what Peter was already talking about multiple environments on a planet. And uh the photochemistry of due to UV is important to the atmosphere as well as Tim Lions was pointing out that's one of the reasons why the atmosphere uh quickly tends to uh to become oxidizing in rocky planets because of the loss of hydrogen and the UV effect on this.

utterance:  Liming Li: Uh right. Yeah, I think the photochemistry is very important for the atmosphere. That's no problem for that. Yeah. of course, the UV, the short wavelength radiation is very important because it provides the energy, basically the strong energy for the chemistry in atmosphere. So actually I want to uh explore the problem from maybe from a different perspective. I think the currently the temperature determination of the exoplanets basically based on the spectral, the infrared spectral or maybe maybe the distance from the mother star, something like that to estimate the temperature. I think maybe there are some other way to better, you know, determine the temperature. I mean the surface temperature, not the temperature on the top. Basically if you get the infrared spectrometer get the infrared spectral of the planet, basically you get the temperature, we call the brightness temperature. It's not the temperature on surface, it's the temperature on the top of atmosphere.

utterance:  Liming Li: So if the planet doesn't have atmosphere, that means the temperature will change a lot from daytime to night time. It's not good for life because for example for for for Mars. Mars the atmosphere is very thin. The temperature, the daytime temperature and light time light time temperature, the difference can reach a couple of hundred degrees. So for for for but if the planet have have atmosphere, so you can check the temperature on the top of atmosphere. But the top atmosphere temperature is totally different from the temperature on surface. For example, for earth is is special for earth the the difference temperature difference between surface and the top of atmosphere just a couple of 10 degrees, 20 maybe 30 degrees, not very huge.

utterance:  Liming Li: But if you check uh Venus, if you check Titan, the temperature difference is huge. So that's mean even you're kind I mean actually I'm not the expert of exoplanets. I I'm not sure which method they are using to determine the temperature of exoplanets. But by my point, even for the planets in our solar system, even for the planets and moons in our solar system, we don't have determine very well the surface temperature. You know, because so uh of course we have some you know in situ measurements for the mass surface temperature. But if you check the global, I mean global scale temperature, that's other problem. So that's mean what's the radiation budget on the top, what's the radiation transfer inside of atmosphere, then what's the precisely what's the temperature on the surface. I I mean the global scale.

utterance:  Liming Li: That's actually even for Mars, we don't have very good very good knowledge for that. Of course, the for the same thing for the Venus, for the Titan, you know, for maybe for yeah. So I mean if we if we can figure out one way to better measure to better determine the surface temperature of exoplanets. I I mean it will help help us to find life maybe help us to find liquid water and life and so on.

So like if planetary scientists could give us, you know, a top five list of things that would be cool to know about, that then we would go do all the experiments, but it's hard to know what to focus on sometimes because you read papers about early earth was like this or Mars is like that and then you do five years of experiments and then it's like no actually the atmosphere is this actually and you're like, oh man, that would have changed everything and so it is just a difficult sometimes to know what conditions to begin.

utterance:  Gongjie Li: What I found very nice to do for exoplanets is there are so much uncertainties.

utterance:  Laurie Barge: What if we did like, you know, there's if there's a Venn diagram here, one is the conditions because we're we're really trying to answer, could life emerge on other exoplanets, right? So could could exoplanet or planetary science people make a list of which parameters are most variable between different planets because that would allow you to say which planet could or could not do a thing. And then the chemists could make which parameters are most effective in changing the way a chemical reaction turns out because you know certain ones you change them in the lab it is not that big of a deal. Other ones you change it, it changes everything and where that overlap is could be, you know, a shorter list where we could focus in the lab. Like if for example it turned out that massive differences in the amount of methane in the atmosphere are going to exist, but methane also really controls all of organic chemistry. That would be a thing to focus on. But then other things like maybe wouldn't.
