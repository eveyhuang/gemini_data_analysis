utterance:  Elaine Hsiao: Yeah, I'll give it to you. Okay, thanks. One question that I had with the neuronal models is whether it's really important to um capture spatial differences from like cell body to through axon and actual synapse because a lot of times I see that the in vitro systems just use the neuron and just dump, you know, metabolite onto it and assumes that the receptors um, you know, are the same at the cell the soma versus, you know, um the synapse. And so, yeah, do you think that um really matters to actually have to grow out the neurons and confine the interactions to actually the synapse only or the axon. 
annotation:  {'Information Seeking': {'explanation': 'Elaine asks a precise and targeted question about the importance of capturing spatial differences in neuronal models, providing detailed context about current in vitro systems and their assumptions.', 'score': 2, 'score_justification': "The question is precise, targeted, and highly relevant, surfacing a critical methodological consideration for the team's discussion on neuronal models."}, 'Knowledge Sharing': {'explanation': 'Elaine shares her observation about how in vitro systems often simplify neuronal interactions by dumping metabolites and assuming uniform receptor distribution, providing relevant context for her question.', 'score': 1, 'score_justification': 'She provides relevant background information with some detail, drawing on her observations to frame her precise question.'}, 'Relational Climate': {'explanation': "Elaine explicitly acknowledges Xin Qi's offer to let her speak by saying 'Yeah, I'll give it to you. Okay, thanks.'", 'score': 1, 'score_justification': 'She explicitly thanks Xin Qi, demonstrating a polite and positive interpersonal tone.'}}
utterance:  Faronak Fattahi: point and I guess a lot of the uh work on the microfluidic devices where you basically segregate the cell bodies from the axons or like if you have multiple cellular components that could be them or the muscle, like focusing on the synapse as opposed to the neural ganglia. Um you know, there are some devices that make that possible, but the issue in those cases is the scalability is the challenge. So you might have to start off with something that's like crude as you describe where you're just like dumping the metabolites on just in the beginning and then once you have at least some potential interesting interactions then use those more complex models to figure out signals to end up with.

Like what would be the kind of the benchmark unit? I don't know what uh whatever scale it is some middle scale. And I think we talked about if I'm answering your question correctly, maybe a single cell analysis from gut tissue, right? Um you know, unless you have again, unless it's a very well worked out system where you know that this side of kind produced by this bacteriphage, you know, uh is the effect is meeting the effect that you're interested in. If it's, you know, novel discovery, I think you just start with single cell or other other single cell sequencing or other cell technologies, right? And then see to what degree you can reproduce those in vivo results in the culture system. But it's probably not it's certainly not perfect. Um but at least you can do this with human tissues as well. And getting back to the previous question, um human versus mouse. I mean, obviously everything is context dependent as pros and cons, but I think one of the the major values of the in vitro systems are that you can use fully human systems, right? You know, if I wanted to do something in humans, you know, it's much easier for me to do you know, let's say if it's novel so it's unethical or not feasible to to actually dose a person with a molecule. Um, I might want to start with an in vitro system that's fully human, right? Because I can always argue I I I can do the mouse system.

You know it's it's surprising at least at least in terms of of theos many many of these cells live quite well under anaerobic conditions. So if you get the conditions right you can model some of the interaction but you won't be able to get all of it right?

You have a cell culture system that you're very proud of you can get it layers and all the connections right? And you have a bacteria that you add that.

utterance:  Elaine Hsiao: like kind of what we're alluding to. I am signal transduction, um ligand receptor interactions. So even just on the cellular biology level. Um but then what Judith was alluded alluding to or information flow. I see these really big physiological questions, like information flow through the vagus nerve versus immune and all of these things that are happening at once. And when I think about the complexity and if the goal is finally to understand brain and behavior, um which is big physiological response. I I feel like over overwhelmed and I wonder whether model system in vitro systems will will do it or whether actually going to in silico systems, like kind of like neural network modeling where you don't need to know all the details, but you just need to have this giant model um would um be better suited. And so um I think probably all of the approaches have um their pros and cons, but that kind of comes to mind when I think about gut brain axis.

utterance:  Xin Qi: Uh I guess the alcohol's Ellis um comments. I think for this field, um the you you will see a lot of variation between models, even between institutions before. Uh I I I still remember the the nature paper published last year from Harvard uh Kevin's lab. They actually definitely showed this ALS mice showed a difference of of of gut micro microbiome and if they if if if the animals raising hover or raising this is the other institution, they definitely showed different vulnerability to this disease as well. So I think the the for the whole field, there's a key question is what is the basis of the microbiome actually does the work and is responsible for the signal transduction in the gut brain axis communication.

utterance:  Xin Qi: And what model will be most suitable to do this sort of research. Uh that's what I thought. Um so my for my understanding the vivo model might be most suitable, right? Because but this is for this session we are talking about if there is cell culture model available, if we can establish some cell culture model, make it our research more simplified. So the thing is this is my valuable question. Um you know, we we we all work on the lab or benchmark, we use the culture models and if like we are so simplified for based on the discussion, we actually um come out the cell culture model. I just really um my question is how how great the society accept the cell culture model and is this is a model that people thought this is a really gut brain communication model or actually this is a simplified we really pick up the single cell like epithelial cells and neuronal cells stimulate stimulate with the microbiome. So this is the question I I I kind of confusing and also I I think that the microbiome species and the model system is probably the key for this whole field.

utterance:  Faronak Fattahi, UCSF: So I guess I have a question.

utterance:  Will Ludington, Carnegie Institution (HU): the other thing that we kept coming back to is like what is the question? Um Uh and is there a model that we can that lets us ask multiple questions or do we at the outset in picking the model need to focus on a question.

utterance:  Faronak Fattahi, UCSF: So like leveraging clinical data and what we know from patients from like, you know, uh that literature could prioritize actual questions to address with the neutral models.

utterance:  Sarkis Mazmanian, Caltech: as I said I I favor that approach, right? Because again it's it's grounded at least the the starting point is human data, right? And it shouldn't be at the expense of let's say De novo discovery, right? Because human data is not going to tell you everything. And so um you know, multiple labs will approach the same problem. Some will take a agnostic approach or high throughput approach. Others are more candidate approach I guess. But again, both are I favor starting with with some some data, right?

utterance:  Elaine Hsiao, UCLA: Oh, sure. So uh hopefully I will um accurately reflect when I report back. Um I think I'll start with just um giving the point that there are many models that are possible and it really depends on the question that we're asking. If we want to study a very detailed cell based model versus an organ level model. And so there's many different types that um all have their own value. And so we talked about the utility of these different types of models. Like there will be simple models that will enable really high throughput screening. Um and in those it's really important to consider cell subtype specificity, the species selection. Um and the inputs if they're microbiome if they're microbial versus a metabolite or effector molecule. Um and then we also talked about more physiological organ level interactions that can also be modeled. Um yeah, did I is there anything that I missed and I should add in there? You know, 50 seconds.

utterance:  Sarkis Mazmanian: And I think the time is right for that. Because again, even two, three years ago, we didn't have the volume of human data, right? And you can compare across studies and you know, you know, meta analysis, right? And so, you know, I think that can make together. Again, it shouldn't be at the cost of a more agnostic approach, but I think the data is out there, right?

utterance:  Jae Sung: How about we like um, a lot of these questions would be very context specific on the particular neurological disorder. So, you know, for example, schizophrenia, um also um Alzheimer's, um different types of uh you know, like compulsive eating disorder, um, I think it's called hedonic, you know, something. I mean, those are all stimulated by different branches or types of chemicals. What what do you guys think?

utterance:  Faranak Fattahi: Do we even as a field know these specific signatures or so this is completely outside of my wheelhouse. So maybe if someone can educate me a little bit about what's been done in terms of profiling the fermentation products in disease versus healthy states or like the sensing of the products, like the local response within the GI. And then is there any work being done or work published on the transmission of these products from the gut to other organ systems. Um, you know, I really don't know anything about any of these topics, but if someone could tell me a little bit more about that, that would be great.

utterance:  George Weinstock: Maybe maybe I can uh just take a second since some of you may not be remembering your your biochemistry course where you talked about microbial fermentation. You know, fermentation can mean a lot of different things. Um, there's a very specific kind of definition about anaerobic fermentation, no oxygen around. And so in order to extract energy from things, you sort of end up making ethanol or you end up making lactic acid, say in muscle or things like that. But then we also know there's fermentation, there's all kinds of foods that you you allow them to ferment, whatever that means, uh that that makes them stable, sterile over time, things like that, kimchi, you know, all kinds of great things like that. And those are supposed to have uh uh some kind of neurological or mental health benefit as well. And there's a whole gamish of things that are being produced in those. So you have this wide range of things. I I I think microbial fermentation really just sort of means um some kind of biochemical transformation that occurs without oxygen, something like that. Emily, you're probably much more of a chemist than I am. Um, what would you what would you say to add to that? 
annotation:  {'Knowledge Sharing': {'explanation': "George provides a detailed explanation of microbial fermentation, including its definition, examples (ethanol, lactic acid, kimchi), and connection to neurological/mental health benefits, directly addressing the team's need for foundational understanding.", 'score': 2, 'score_justification': "The contribution is accurate, detailed, and directly useful, especially in response to Faranak's earlier request for education on the topic."}, 'Participation Dynamics': {'explanation': 'George explicitly invites Emily to contribute by acknowledging her expertise as a chemist and asking her to add to his explanation of fermentation.', 'score': 2, 'score_justification': "This is a targeted invitation tied to Emily's specific expertise, which effectively balances contributions and leverages team members' strengths."}}
utterance:  Emily Balskus: Yeah, so I would say that's a great kind of description of of fermentation as a process. Um, one of the hallmarks of microbial fermentation versus fermentation and other or organisms such as ourselves when we do anaerobic metabolism is just the diversity of different processes that they can carry out. The just we tend to think about um metabolism often of of sugar substrates. Microbes can also in the gut ferment things like amino acids. Um, other types of of molecules could also be connected to their anaerobic metabolism, um including dietary um a more unusual dietary um molecules beyond even just polysaccharides or sugars. Um, so um, yeah, so I think I think that that's one of the things that's sort of most unique about this this setting, I think is that there's just a a huge range of metabolism, some of which we may not have even really discovered yet.

utterance:  George Weinstock: Well, I think it's uh these are small molecules.

Uh, but uh, you know, I I I think that um that could be something worth worth looking into.

utterance:  Jae Sung: Yeah, that's kind of what our group does. Uh thanks for uh uh we're not wizards, Robin. We just use basic statistics and a little bit of coding. Um Calvin, you were mentioning what type of models, but there's also what models could be used, for example, cellular tissue organisms, um to kind of prioritize, you know, which metabolites or bacteria may actually matter. I mean, we could start off by just simple um you know, uh statistical approaches. I'm sure many of you have heard principle component analysis and all that is is just like takes a high dimensional data space, reduces it down to like, you know, how small tractable number like 10 or so, most most of the time two or three. Um and these components which they're called Latin variables, they're all independent of each other or you know, based on math, they're they're independent of each other. So basically are those and then if you look at those principle components, which are just a function of all these, you know, um different types of metabolites, maybe do those map in regards to linking to like a phenotype or a disease or a clinical endpoint. I mean, there's many ways to do this from a, you know, from a bioinformatic standpoint, but you know, more of the wet lab, the bench standpoint, like for example, cellular tissue organism models, mouse models, etc. And I think Robin mentioned

utterance:  Kaixiong Ye: I have two comments. The first one is that I totally agree with Jay about using some statistical approach to summarize metabolite. But no matter how you do, no matter which metabolite or metabolite pattern you are looking at, you need the output. You need to you need to need some experimental result to help correlate the two of them. And apparently we want to start with a specific phenotype, either disease or brain imaging as the phenotype and then to screen many metabolite patterns. I'm I'm that's a question. I hopefully I'm thinking if there's an easy experimental model can help us screen many metabolite or metabolite pattern. It will be very useful at least for one specific disease.

utterance:  Faranak Fattahi: I think we have the problem is not generating the relevant cells. So you can generate intestinal epithelial cells, neurons, you know, a lot of different cell types. The question is what what's the most appropriate readout? Like, for instance, with neurons, are you looking for neuronal activity? Are you looking for secretion of a particular cytokine or growth factor? Are you looking for a switch in the metabolic state? And so, you know, the first one, the activity readout is scalable, so you can do that high throughput. But if you're looking for a global switch in the metabolic state, that's not scalable, right? So maybe you can start with some scalable readouts, you have 100 candidates, narrow that down to five, and then for those five, look at how those five affect the metabolic shift in the neurons. And then from there, test them on mouse models. So like a sequential study with different degrees of complexity.

But like, we can't, but how do we actually control that? I mean, you don't want them just be secreting butyrate like all the time. And will that have any, and how do we actually know? Like, for example, this is like a philosophical question. But what do we know? What is the actual healthy state? What is the the host healthy state? This is something my lab thinks about a lot. What is the actual state that we want to induce? And do all these chemicals and all these, you know, functions actually matter towards getting us closer to that that endpoint of normal brain activity? I don't know how you define normal, but healthy brain activity, you know?
