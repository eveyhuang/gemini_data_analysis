            "transcript": "Maybe something to add about just um your respective chemistry. Generally, we're going to be using electro chemical approaches to either replace or work in concert with thermochemical approaches. Beyond the chemistry, the mode of operation I think is really important in terms of flexibility and scale. So if you look at, you know, this example of ammonia, if you have steam, methane performing high temperature running 24/7, Haberbash, high temperature 24/7. Um one of the advantages of electro chemistry is that even a part of that can follow the load directly or have some kind of buffer, it can be a flexible way to, you know, use excess grid electricity to store hydrogen and then be able to defeat it at different time scales. And so the modes of operation for those things are not only continuous, uh high temperature and large scale. I think some of the flexibility that we get in electro chemistry is we can scale things down, which isn't always seen as an advantage, but we can scale them down and be flexible. So I think in in terms of the chemistry, there may be certain chemistries like I would think, you know, making hydrogen um as something that can load follow from the grid, take the excess renewable electricity at a given time of the day, store hydrogen, use it somewhere else. That may give us more advantages than just trying to do something directly uh electrochemically, which will be hard to compete one to one with thermochemistry. So the thing I just want to add there is that, you know, the flexibility and the scale of electro chemistry gives us a lot of advantages when we're trying to couple different types of systems together.",

And it really depends and if we think about two of the molecules we talked about nitrogen and ammonia. I'm sorry, nitrogen and methane. Um the the real question is when you want to using it, right? As as do you want to use it right on the spot or you want to and where got those model. We have a lot of nitrogen in the air, so maybe that's not an issue, but as a as today's presentation shows that methane concentration is fairly small in the air. So even and so the question is maybe one thing before we discussing what kind of technology we develop. For example, for methane question is under what scenario we should develop that technology. And that may help later for the techno life cycle analysis too. Um because when you know pinpoint on what scenario we want using those.",

One is the order of magnitude like potential for carbon sequestration. So if you think about that, like going after something like cement and steel, right? Um is really important. Um but can you do it electro can you electrify that process is unknown, right? Um and so there's the order of magnitude approach to deciding what is worth going after. Uh but then there's the the approach of we can do something we know we can engineer something to do that task. Um and so I'm curious uh about this group what they think um like it should drive the research, should be be going after things based on order magnitude um of the the potential for CO2 sequestration or should we be going more after um what we can electrify within the next five years.",

I think figuring out how to do electrosynthetic transformations that are universal to wide varieties of synthetic processes is useful is very useful because you're not targeting a specific molecule but you're target it's methodology. It's basically organic methodology using carbon-free feed stocks. And that's super important and that goes to even though the target molecule might be a small component, overall you're changing how an industry approaches that conversion. And so it's a big aggregate effect. And I think that's really important um to think about both in the scale and that so so it's complicated because there's some of those processes that could be electrified in the next five years that may not be a giant component individually, but might have a larger continuing uh impact over the next 10 or 15 years as the industry begins to shift away.",

And I think so one thing that I've been wondering about is that so we talked about lots of different types of transformations here. So nitrogen, methane and these carbon carbon transformations. And what I've wondered about is how like when you're designing a system to do a particular transformation, how um specific does that material need to be for a particular transformation or can we build um uh electrodes or electrochemical systems that can do many different types of electrochemical transformations given the same um electrochemical systems given the same electrode basically. Right? So might not be like the perfect electrode to be to do one particular transformation perfectly, but it can do many very well. Um and I think that's uh",

            "transcript": "I think information we can get about that looking at at one particular system, I do think we do need this life cycle perspective because no no one system is going to do everything. You know, that everything in the chemical process industry includes multiple steps and an example of where that can be relevant of just having that information is, you know, if you want to do uh CO2 conversion to syngas and make, you know, send send gas to a Fisher trope synthesis plant. Well, if Fisher trope synthesis is going on at like, you know, 50 bar or something, then you can start to question, well, do I want to make my syngas at atmospheric conditions, then pressurize the gas and send it in, which is, you know, several energy penalties. Or if you know the downstream processing is already at high pressure, what if we do our direct electrosynthesis at directly high pressure? And then you so so in that sense, I think getting to that question of what are the ideal conditions we want for our system to understand fundamentals and optimize mechanisms. I think we do need to know more about the up and downstream processes in terms of, you know, what volumes do they need, what again, what flexibility um do they have and and even what conditions they run at because the integration is going to be where where I think electrochemistry will win is if we can integrate with existing processes that are already very, very efficient. You know, can we can we have the same efficiency of one step without the CO2 emissions or even improve efficiency, but I think the integration is going to be essential to knowing what are the conditions to optimize an individual catalyst or electrode.",

It's it's like a tandem catalysis, but it's like food to enzyme to production. But what's cool about that is it gets back to what Katie said is is that that could be used for basically any enzymatic system. So if you can do that step, you you can do any enzymatic transformation from that.",
