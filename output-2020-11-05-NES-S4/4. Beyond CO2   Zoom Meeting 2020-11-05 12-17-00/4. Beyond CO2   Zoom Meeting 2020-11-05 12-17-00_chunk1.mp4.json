            "transcript": "Its intermediates in general, doesn't matter which small molecule we catalyze. So CO2 is like an obvious one, nitrogen is an obvious one. There are obvious problems with that. But we learn so much that, and I'm also a little bit confused honestly, and I apologize for my naivete about the proper definition of negative emission science still. Right? It reminds me a little bit of, you know, green chemistry before 1990 just dealt with the waste that was already being produced rather than preventing waste in the first place. So I'm not completely sure that there is a clear definition. So that's why I, sorry, I'm just trying still to get calibrated here. But like to me, right, if I look at the chemical industry, if you look at fine chemicals, right, the higher you go up in complexity, the more waste you produce. I mean, that translates to a bigger CO2 footprint as well. So, you know, all of a sudden we could be talking about electrochemical approaches to chiral synthesis of like building blocks or more complex molecules. So I don't, you know, I don't want to take the discussion in the wrong direction. I'm just confused about what our focus is. But to finally answer Marcus's question, I was just talking about generating the chemical fuel for the enzyme that does the reaction we don't know how to do it properly. So you spend less energy making NADH if your enzyme gives you the product you want, for example.",

So what I wrote down was more along the lines of what you were mentioning is using electrochemistry more broadly as a synthetic chemistry tool, right? So, you know, making um carbon-carbon bond formation or like doing sort of organic chemistry electrochemically. Um is there an opportunity to um to do that and would that be in terms of like the is that going to is that going to decrease um waste, make those make those reactions more efficient and more um and less expensive carbon or CO2 sense in terms of how much energy goes into um the those uh later stage chemical transformations.",

            "transcript": "I I'd be interested in building on that one a little bit. Um so so I think there's two things to think about. Uh the the first one is really like identifying what what the transformations that that make a difference are. So maybe something like the the top 10. So so there was this article maybe 10 years ago about biomass conversion and like what the top 10 platform chemicals are to to get to all the other stuff that we produce. And and so maybe like revisiting that and and sort of saying what are the targets and then which ones are kind of most amenable to to synthesis with renewable routes. And and on that uh on that point, um you know, there's there's two ways to think about it because there's the direct electrochemistry which so so that's more the area I'm involved in. Um but but there's also the argument that if you can produce H2 and CO and a couple building blocks maybe with electrochemistry, then you can kind of just drop those into existing infrastructure and and do a lot of the synthetic chemistry that we already have uh in our industrial processes. And so I I was hoping somebody in here would be like a life cycle analysis kind of big big picture thinker because we I think we have a lot of molecular people here. Um but but curious to get get input and and team with people who you know, have have the expertise to to decide what what the priority chemistries are. You know, once we say this is the reaction to work on, then I think a lot of us have the tool set to to optimize it and develop better materials and things like that, but sometimes choosing the problem is hard.",

Um, you know, I I'm not a life cycle analysis person, but I I I work with people who who are and a lot of the concern with the commodity chemical route is it it's important from a cost perspective and it is negative carbon emissions because if you're not using CO2 generated feed stocks or fossil fuel feed stocks to make those that that's good or you're not using fossil fuels to make them. But the the the amount of those commodity chemicals we make are small compared to uh the big feed stocks like methanol, like CH4, like acetic acid, things like that, which are enormous, enormous, enormous drivers of the uh fine chemical industry. Um so so it's just a matter of making sure the life cycle analysis suggests that it will not only be negative, but that it's the big uh negative emissions. And and I think things like carbon chloride, carbon nitrogen bonds, carbon fluoride bonds, or carbon halogen bonds and even small like C1, C2, carbon carbon coupling bonds are are really um from my very not life cycle analysis uh perspective are the ones that I've heard anecdotally as the big drivers uh in that more so than making the pharmaceutical products, for instance.",

And and you know, once you have a more active bond like an alkane or or an alcohol or something, then those are going to be you know, you're going to be able to do the substitution reactions like the halogenations or maybe more coupling. So, you know, taking CO2 or or CO to carboxylate or carbonyl wave and and extend the carbon chain. Um so so those kinds of chemistries are are things we've been thinking about. But but again, it's I I I'm trying to remember if there was a stat in the the keynote talks about kind of the the Yeah. what the 12,000 Yeah. what the kind of since no single commodity chemical is going to make a giant dent. Yeah. Like the But if you take the top couple dozen, uh you know, what what's the what's the upside if we could make them all in a really reducible way? Yeah. And I I I think that number maybe came there. Um but but it was it was still small compared to Because there's still some of the carbonating molecules or something like that. But uh it it was not negligible and I think uh yeah, just just getting a sense of of like what the pitch is. Um because because I think these chemistries are really exciting, but we got to like have this the selling point for it too.",

And that was something like 200 megatons equivalents uh for polymers. And so that's a real, I mean, I don't know how you're going to do like CO2 to a polymer, but that's a real uh area I think of of interest. Um Yeah, so well, so uh I don't know about getting all the way from CO2 to polymers, but uh one of the really popular chemistries is is indirect route where you're first sequestering in biomass, but then once you get uh some of the furanes that that you get from hydrolyzing biomass, you can turn those into to monomer building blocks. So uh HMF to furan dicarboxylic acid and then you could potentially get the same thing from the molecule furfural, but there's an extra carboxylating step. It's probably hard to picture all these structures right here, but there's you know, if if you have the uh you know, nature doing some of the carbon carbon coupling and then you can do some of the modifying steps afterward. I I know those are like the the biggest candidates for for green polymers.
