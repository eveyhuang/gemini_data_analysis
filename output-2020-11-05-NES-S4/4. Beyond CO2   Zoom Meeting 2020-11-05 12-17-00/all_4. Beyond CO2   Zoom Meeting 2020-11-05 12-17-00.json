But we learn so much that, and I'm also a little bit confused honestly, and I apologize for my naivete about the proper definition of negative emission science still. Right? It reminds me a little bit of, you know, green chemistry before 1990 just dealt with the waste that was already being produced rather than preventing waste in the first place. So I'm not completely sure that there is a clear definition. So that's why I, sorry, I'm just trying still to get calibrated here. But like to me, right, if I look at the chemical industry, if you look at fine chemicals, right, the higher you go up in complexity, the more waste you produce. I mean, that translates to a bigger CO2 footprint as well. So, you know, all of a sudden we could be talking about electrochemical approaches to chiral synthesis of like building blocks or more complex molecules. So I don't, you know, I don't want to take the discussion in the wrong direction. I'm just confused about what our focus is. But to finally answer Marcus's question, I was just talking about generating the chemical fuel for the enzyme that does the reaction we don't know how to do it properly. So you spend less energy making NADH if your enzyme gives you the product you want, for example.",

Uh the the first one is really like identifying what what the transformations that that make a difference are. So maybe something like the the top 10. So so there was this article maybe 10 years ago about biomass conversion and like what the top 10 platform chemicals are to to get to all the other stuff that we produce. And and so maybe like revisiting that and and sort of saying what are the targets and then which ones are kind of most amenable to to synthesis with renewable routes. And and on that uh on that point, um you know, there's there's two ways to think about it because there's the direct electrochemistry which so so that's more the area I'm involved in. Um but but there's also the argument that if you can produce H2 and CO and a couple building blocks maybe with electrochemistry, then you can kind of just drop those into existing infrastructure and and do a lot of the synthetic chemistry that we already have uh in our industrial processes. And so I I was hoping somebody in here would be like a life cycle analysis kind of big big picture thinker because we I think we have a lot of molecular people here. Um but but curious to get get input and and team with people who you know, have have the expertise to to decide what what the priority chemistries are. You know, once we say this is the reaction to work on, then I think a lot of us have the tool set to to optimize it and develop better materials and things like that, but sometimes choosing the problem is hard.",

Um, you know, I I'm not a life cycle analysis person, but I I I work with people who who are and a lot of the concern with the commodity chemical route is it it's important from a cost perspective and it is negative carbon emissions because if you're not using CO2 generated feed stocks or fossil fuel feed stocks to make those that that's good or you're not using fossil fuels to make them. But the the the amount of those commodity chemicals we make are small compared to uh the big feed stocks like methanol, like CH4, like acetic acid, things like that, which are enormous, enormous, enormous drivers of the uh fine chemical industry. Um so so it's just a matter of making sure the life cycle analysis suggests that it will not only be negative, but that it's the big uh negative emissions. And and I think things like carbon chloride, carbon nitrogen bonds, carbon fluoride bonds, or carbon halogen bonds and even small like C1, C2, carbon carbon coupling bonds are are really um from my very not life cycle analysis uh perspective are the ones that I've heard anecdotally as the big drivers uh in that more so than making the pharmaceutical products, for instance.",

        "transcript": "Maybe something to add about just um your respective chemistry. Generally, we're going to be using electro chemical approaches to either replace or work in concert with thermochemical approaches. Beyond the chemistry, the mode of operation I think is really important in terms of flexibility and scale. So if you look at, you know, this example of ammonia, if you have steam, methane performing high temperature running 24/7, Haberbash, high temperature 24/7. Um one of the advantages of electro chemistry is that even a part of that can follow the load directly or have some kind of buffer, it can be a flexible way to, you know, use excess grid electricity to store hydrogen and then be able to defeat it at different time scales. And so the modes of operation for those things are not only continuous, uh high temperature and large scale. I think some of the flexibility that we get in electro chemistry is we can scale things down, which isn't always seen as an advantage, but we can scale them down and be flexible. So I think in in terms of the chemistry, there may be certain chemistries like I would think, you know, making hydrogen um as something that can load follow from the grid, take the excess renewable electricity at a given time of the day, store hydrogen, use it somewhere else. That may give us more advantages than just trying to do something directly uh electrochemically, which will be hard to compete one to one with thermochemistry. So the thing I just want to add there is that, you know, the flexibility and the scale of electro chemistry gives us a lot of advantages when we're trying to couple different types of systems together.",

As as do you want to use it right on the spot or you want to and where got those model. We have a lot of nitrogen in the air, so maybe that's not an issue, but as a as today's presentation shows that methane concentration is fairly small in the air. So even and so the question is maybe one thing before we discussing what kind of technology we develop. For example, for methane question is under what scenario we should develop that technology. And that may help later for the techno life cycle analysis too. Um because when you know pinpoint on what scenario we want using those.",

I think figuring out how to do electrosynthetic transformations that are universal to wide varieties of synthetic processes is useful is very useful because you're not targeting a specific molecule but you're target it's methodology. It's basically organic methodology using carbon-free feed stocks. And that's super important and that goes to even though the target molecule might be a small component, overall you're changing how an industry approaches that conversion. And so it's a big aggregate effect. And I think that's really important um to think about both in the scale and that so so it's complicated because there's some of those processes that could be electrified in the next five years that may not be a giant component individually, but might have a larger continuing uh impact over the next 10 or 15 years as the industry begins to shift away.",

You know, that everything in the chemical process industry includes multiple steps and an example of where that can be relevant of just having that information is, you know, if you want to do uh CO2 conversion to syngas and make, you know, send send gas to a Fisher trope synthesis plant. Well, if Fisher trope synthesis is going on at like, you know, 50 bar or something, then you can start to question, well, do I want to make my syngas at atmospheric conditions, then pressurize the gas and send it in, which is, you know, several energy penalties. Or if you know the downstream processing is already at high pressure, what if we do our direct electrosynthesis at directly high pressure? And then you so so in that sense, I think getting to that question of what are the ideal conditions we want for our system to understand fundamentals and optimize mechanisms. I think we do need to know more about the up and downstream processes in terms of, you know, what volumes do they need, what again, what flexibility um do they have and and even what conditions they run at because the integration is going to be where where I think electrochemistry will win is if we can integrate with existing processes that are already very, very efficient.

But I had the same question as I was as I've been listening is tying it back to the negative emissions goal. I've been trying to kind of bucket what I'm hearing into what sound to me like things that would fall into a stricter definition of negative emissions of actually removing, removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere or the ocean that have been emitted previously by some other process versus decarbonizing some existing process or replacing it, replacing an existing process that emits. So that, you know, you that I would put that in kind of the mitigation basket, not the negative emissions basket. So Jordi, I think I may be just saying what you said in a different way, but that's also where my head goes is trying to understand how what what of this discussion is more relevant to kind of reducing future emissions versus having pathways to actually, you know, quote unquote undo emissions and reduce existing greenhouse gas stocks.",

I, and I'm sorry, I don't remember your name, but the gentleman who made the comment that it sounds like scientific progress in this area could equally, or at least in theory, could be applied to both mitigation and negative emissions. And if that's true, then that's just a win-win. So that maybe these distinctions don't really help. But here's as a funder in this space, I'll share, I'll share my thoughts, which is if you saw the chart that we see a lot that in the keynote that comes from the 2017 UNEP report that's showing, showing the projections decades out of, you know, even with a very aggressive pathway for emissions reduction, right? You still need this massive wedge of negative emissions of the removal of previously emitted greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere or the oceans somehow at a scale of 10 or 20 gigatons a year by mid or late century. That's what focuses my, my attention as a funder on those, specifically the negative emissions technologies that aren't getting funded and aren't getting developed that we wish we'd have been developing the core science for 10 years ago, right? Because we can't wait till 2050 to all of a sudden just, you know, reach into the closet and pull out 10 gigaton a year scaled, you know, everything. You know, like we're, we're behind there. So that's why negative emissions for me is the focus is that, you know, by comparison, the efforts to reduce our, our emissions are getting more funding and more attention, whether it's through, you know, the electrification of everything or, you know, all of this stuff that we're talking about. It's not to say that I don't think it's important. It's more just that if we don't, if we don't acknowledge that actual negative emissions is the plug that's making these climate models work in 2050 and beyond, and we don't have actual scalable negative emissions technologies, then, then the climate math breaks. So, um, it's not at all to diminish the importance of, you know, if there was a breakthrough in core science that was applicable to both mitigation and to negative emissions, that's, that's a no-brainer win-win. But, but I'll stop here because I see the time's running out. I hope that explains it. That's why funders like us are so attracted to negative emissions because it's, it's those tools don't seem to be there yet, and we're going to need them.",
