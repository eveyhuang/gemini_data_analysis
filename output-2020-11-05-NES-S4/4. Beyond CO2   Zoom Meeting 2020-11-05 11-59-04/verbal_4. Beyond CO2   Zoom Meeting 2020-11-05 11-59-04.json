As somebody who's been on your side and has been on Marta's position right now, which is to record, it's very helpful if you are able to build from each other's ideas and see if that converges. It doesn't have to converge, but think about it in that aspect as well. You know, how would you build your ideas on top of somebody else's? Because the goal of the recorder is to distill the big, more than just say everything that was said. It's important that the recorder finds the ideas that are gaining the most traction. That makes the report's job easier and also more impactful when you go to the report out, which will happen after we're done.

One of the things, especially going beyond CO2, one of the things obviously is nitrogen transformation, nitrogen to ammonia or just ammonia, sustainable ammonia synthesis in general. I think the real thing is doing that as low temperature ammonia synthesis. That could be direct electrochemical or probably more practical is to do a low temperature hydrogenation for distributed ammonia because the issue right now is when you do elevated temperatures, you have to do elevated pressures of H2 to overcome the thermodynamic barriers of increasing the temperature to go to the kinetic barriers of nitrogen nitrogen bond cleavage. So if you can do low temperature, if you can break that nitrogen nitrogen bond kinetically at lower temperatures, then you don't need as much hydrogen pumping in. You don't need the pressures of hydrogen which allows you to use electrolytic hydrogen from solar hydrogen. Or you could do direct electrochemical, although I think that's very, very hard to out compete hydrogen evolution for electrochemical ammonia. ",

Actually, it's also very energy consuming and energy intensive for the current processes. So the new processes, for example, electrochemical conversion of the ammonium to nitrogen is also beneficial to the whole point. And backward, the nitrate reduction, I think that's something also important because for the environmental issues, right? So current technology also use a lot of thermal treatment and separation process to reduce it. So we can also develop technology. I have one year front to monitor this. This because it's my birth. ",

Um, it has been demonstrated in papers, but I would say that that still has not really been demonstrated. That would be a large energy savings instead of having to go through ammonia as an intermediate. Um, with the question of the nitrogen also, um, I think that there's lots of questions on, um, I know there's lots of questions on whether like ammonia should be used as a fuel as well as like a fertilizer. Um, and I think that from a from a perspective, um, from a life cycle perspective, um, you're running into questions that mirror that with respect to ethanol.

One way we thought about is actually we are doing is just feeding electricity to accelerate nitrogenase, um, which have done pretty well in MBA environment for millions of years and you get organic fertilizer out of the buck and you just feed it spray through the ground, you don't need to separate that, um, because anyway they go to the ground in a field. Um, another thing I want to add on similarly as the messing which we haven't touched on yet, but nature has enzyme to do messing too.
