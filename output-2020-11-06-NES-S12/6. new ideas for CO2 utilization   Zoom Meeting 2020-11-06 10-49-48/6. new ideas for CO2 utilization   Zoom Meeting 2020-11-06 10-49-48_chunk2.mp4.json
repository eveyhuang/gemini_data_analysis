Is something we we think about but from my perspective, at least as it relates to the issues that have come up so far in this session, I I don't have a clear picture of what are the, you know, best avenues in terms of actual cost, economic impact. Or is that is that all the way known at this point?",

People who think it should cost a small amount of money and it's not going to. Um we're we're going to pay to have our climate fixed. It's not going to be thousands of dollars, but it's certainly going to be hundreds of dollars per ton. And so, you know, don't let the cost be the thing that keeps you from developing these processes right now. But at the same time, don't let yourself get trapped into, you know, like this discussion uh uh Batar about where you're going to get your calcium and magnesium mines. Big that's a big deal. They're heavy. You can't you know, you have to think about those kinds of things, but I would I would discourage you from thinking too much about the cost right now and more think about the overall uh systems. Land use is a big deal. You can come up with more money, but you can't get more land. Things like that.",

I think one thing that doesn't get enough attention in terms of creative ideas is now you're talking about energy inputs that vary as a function of time, right? And the question of not um set steady state chemical processes for making products, but intermittent processes that um that are that are not only uh I think flexible towards intermittent energy inputs, but also maybe take advantage of those uh spikes and you know, troughs in energy input if you will. Maybe at a process level, maybe at a molecular or atomic scale. That's something that is a question I think that hasn't been asked to the best of my knowledge and I just wonder if there were um I mean, following up on Roger's comment about trying to come up with creative solutions, right? Are those variable energy input, non-constant energy inputs, do they allow you to uh allow you to develop more I don't know, catalyst and processes and absorbents that are a traditional if you will, for lack of a better term.

Um so what it means is that if you don't provide energy source for them for extended period of time, they they they anyone use all the living organism you see here has been tested, pressure tested already. Um so so that's the nature of that. Um and so and so in that context, if you couple with electrochemistry with microorganisms, it doesn't mean you have to feed them all the time. Of course, if you stop feeding them for a year, they probably will die, but if you don't feed them for a couple days, um they once you're providing energy again, they pick up and they replicate themselves, they grow. And so they you can if you think about microorganism as a catalyst, the amount of catalyst you have is dependent on how much energy you're providing because they self replicate. You don't need to control how much catalyst you have there.",

So let's say let's say in this particular case we're talking about a hybrid capture and conversion device, right? So let's say I'm capturing CO2 using from air using an absorption process and I put in a temperature input, energy input to desorb CO2 at close to atmospheric pressure, right? Let's say that if I have an intermittent energy input, my concentration of CO2 can vary, right? If I'm doing a standard absorption process, that that would not be the case, but for an intermittent energy input, let's say that sometimes my CO2 pressure is is let's say 0.1 bar and let's say sometimes it's two bar.",

Compared to say that if you had downstream a biological catalyst uh versus a traditional heterogeneous catalyst, the biological catalyst would be less sensitive and more flexible to something like the the reaction temperature and the CO2 partial pressure that it could convert the CO2 at. So so I I I think um first of all, um I think they are very flexible about pressure for CO2. Um when we in our system when we did experiment, we have a gas tank of CO2, but sometimes we we get bored and we just blow our our breath into the reactor, it works and that's much lower concentration of carbon dioxide and it also works. Um and one tricky thing about biological system is temperature. It's much more and and because um if you heat it up too much, they die. The protein denatures. So I wouldn't say they have definite advantage in temperature, but they definitely have advantage in pressure, partial pressure of the feed stock you're dealing with.",

So and so from engineering point of view, if think about why sometimes big fermentator has an issue. You get if you if you ferment a beer, it get too big, sometimes the beer doesn't taste that good. Um partly because the heat is not uniform. The temperature profile is not uniform anymore and the change of the um process there. Um so so and that is what I would say is a consideration is um biological system are much more sensitive to temperature because 35 degree they survive, 40 degree they die. Um but beyond that um right because temperature wise that's a you need to have better control. Um but if you think about um pressure wise, they they they are much adaptive very adaptive to that.",
