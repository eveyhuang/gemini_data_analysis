I think electrochemistry, in terms of a discipline, is one where progress has been extraordinarily slow, which is because of the fact that it's a very complex system, many interacting components. Getting meaningful learning and by learning, I mean, okay, you go do some experiments, you do some simulation, and you want to answer some hypothesis, right? And often the ratio of the number of experiments or number of simulations run to test a hypothesis is very, very high. And that has to do with the fact that getting high quality data is very difficult. So I think here, I think there's going to be a significant advancement possible, especially, you know, especially in this sort of very complex space of TiO2 where you have many different control variables, many different design variables. So I think robotic experimentation and machine learning, I think is going to fundamentally alter this space. And it's going to be a frontier that electrochemistry could be very well positioned to steer head because a lot of the setups that we need actually are conducive for being able to do automated experiments and may not require, like, you know, human handling and so on. Like doing things with robotic arms and so on is much harder than being able to automate like flow through type setups. So I think that aspect I think could be one that I feel very passionately about as sort of an NSF frontier for electrochem.",

That's also depending on what we feed the catalyst and what we want out of it. So I think that these are the things that are self-similar and iterative in a very positive way that, you know, this kind of screening catalysts can also be used to screen feed stock. And then we can see what's the combination of different feed stocks and catalysts that gives us the desired product.",

Um, we, uh, focus a lot in our group on trying to understand, uh, the mechanism pathways to figure out which are the key steps because oftentimes selectivity, for example, is determined at some common intermediate. And that's what dictates what happens with the rest of the reaction. So I think, um, I'm very in favor of, um, using machine learning, uh, to help us discover catalyst, but I think right now in some cases we don't know what the question is, if that makes sense. Like what are the key bond making breaking steps? What are the key, um, intermediates in different reaction pathways, um, that we need to understand in order to improve selectivity. And for the first question, um, which is about novel materials and electrode architectures, I have two thoughts on that. One is that, um, transport for capture is important because it's dilute. And that's something I didn't appreciate until I started talking to engineers. Um, and then the other thing is that can we design architectures that can do cascades because the more I do catalyst design, I realize that, you know, it's hard to optimize a single catalyst to go through several steps. So that if you can optimize a sequence of them and then organize them, then that could be a way to get better selectivity.",

Um, but that also presents an even harder characterization problem and kind of throughput problem because once you have more complicated material structure composition, it becomes harder to tune and kind of evaluate things independently.

And what I also say is machine learning definitely can help a lot of times if you are trying to grasp a better understanding of some of these initial chemistries which are, you know, the more complex the material becomes, more challenging even from a theoretical point standpoint. Throughput computing combined with, you know, machine learning or trying to understand, you know, what targeted properties we are looking for. For example, a lot of good electrocatalysts are available, right? We also want to make sure there's a route to also find cost effective materials. For example, platinum is not going to be the only answer every time. For instance, we try to do something like this. I quite famously, you know, system here works well, but you're not going to sequester carbon dioxide using platinum. That's where probably machine learning or, you know, modeling can also work with experiment to try to optimize those kind of experiments. And I think that that could be really challenging, but I think it's a fascinating route to follow actually.",
