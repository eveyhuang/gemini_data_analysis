            "transcript": "40. That's an excellent question. I think electrochemistry is definitely very fundamental to many fields. But I think the topic here really calls for our serious consideration what electrochemistry cannot do now or in other words, what other fields that we can learn from that electrochemistry can do which really boost the outreach of electrochemistry. For example, what we can learn from the heterogeneous catalysis is that these reactions happen at elevated temperature. Can we drive electrochemistry at elevated temperature in the gas phase or in the vapor phase? I think there are quite a few work now to show we can actually do it at about the solvent boiling point but utilizing the solid state electrolyte or membrane. For example, also in terms of photocatalysis, not photoelectrocatalysis. photocatalysis means you are generating reducing along the same liquid interface, which means you can really do locally redox reactions. That is not available in electrochemistry, not just yet. So can we learn something from what photochemistry can do and really boost the the capability of electrocatalysis because because all these I think just take a very traditional field photo corrosion. corrosion is all local. That means there exists a locally different potentials during the corrosion sites. And you could oxidize the material and reducing oxygen at the same time that builds a locally galvanic cell. So can we learn something from there in terms of corrosion process and actually but these are our favorite bio and organic fuels or some other things with some useful type of statistical analysis to answer your question.

And of course, we know we know little about the electrochemical double layer, its formations, compositions, dynamics and their operating conditions, especially how that behaves not in a model to in electro fuel cell type of design or MEA type of design. So that is I know. So and and also what I think here is that um Yeah, literally I tried it and many electrocatalysts now are moving towards oxides, nitrides and carbides. Um, of course, you would like to have electrocatalysts that are conductive, which means it is metallic. But many of these oxide or sulfide or nitride, they're actually semiconductors or having a band gap. Of course, you could have defects. But how do we understand the defects and electronic structures influence the catalysis process. It's a shame because two component is very useful but at that point we don't really understand. So I think that is not discussed too much. We basically just treat electrocatalysts as a metal. What if we think differently? Um, so there's so that's also not too much discussed.",

Um, but um in terms of system integration, there's lots of sources for waste heat and so if we could take advantage of those driving forces.

I think SCI or self-formed films on top of electrode surfaces as a way to sort of allow the molecules that you want to transport inside, block other things, um being able to tune reactivity, selectivity. So really thinking about sort of, you know, self-formed films um for electrosynthesis. I think that could be one where we learn a lot from the the battery world in terms of how to control it, how to modify it, how to tune it, etc. Don't get the wrong impression though. The battery community doesn't know how to do that, but that's a different story. continue continue with the same level of misunderstanding and then bring all that misunderstanding here carefully and confuse everyone. electrocatalysis people, you're like understanding mechanisms. All right, we'll throw the complexity at you so that you can never understand the mechanism.",

And I think one thing that we're missing in understanding is um a continual model uh of of an electrochemical system that can include the double layer, they can include the diffuse layer, they can include you know, these different length scales, time scales and energy scales. So I mean just a simple model of what? understanding the SCI interface. I mean, we cannot model an electric field even at a computational level with DFT. It's it's getting better now, but to include explicit salvation, to include potential, to include transport effects. I mean, I think having that's to me a frontier of something that's that's not known that would help our understanding and optimization is if we had better continuum modeling across all the scales from the surface to the bulk.",

But as as electrochemist, we got to convince them, okay, there's another frontier that electrochemistry can play a role. But then for us, the bigger question is how does that impact the practicality? And and for example, the industry may think, okay, you have you're relying on interfaces, not the whole heterogeneous homogeneous surface area in a homogeneous phase. So you don't build much of the porous electrode as we do. I mean porous materials and the phases that we do. So what is the limitation of electrochemistry? And how can we really leverage what is already out there and play the electrochemistry strengths. So I think that's an open question that really improve or really boost the electrochemistry.",
