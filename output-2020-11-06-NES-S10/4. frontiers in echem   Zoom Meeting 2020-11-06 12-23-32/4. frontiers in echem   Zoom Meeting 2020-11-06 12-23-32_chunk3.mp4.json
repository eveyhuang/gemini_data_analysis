Uh, and then, you know, ECS, um, uh, you know, I think generally doesn't have too much heterogeneous catalysis. So, so I think there's not, it's not clear that there's an easy bridge, uh, to be, to be formed. And I think, you know, I guess, you know, in terms of communities, I think it's, it's not, they see it as competing, right? I mean, I think, uh, it's a little like batteries versus fuel cells, right? I think, uh, I think it, you know, it's, which is why I guess, you know, the DOE merit review now, they, they, the two are now no longer together, right?

Um, and so that should, that's us, you know, hopefully a misnomer. But, um, I, I do think the thermo catalysis community, there's a, you know, advent of like dynamic catalysis and people are applying biases and people are looking at how, um, Exxon Mobile and all these industries are, want to electrify these processes in some sort. So, I don't know. I, I think that, that, that may just be time and adoption. But I do think, I do think thermo catalysis people are coming around to electrochemistry.

I think it's directly a matter of the competition. There are already existing processes that are large scale that have a very cheap feed stock and relatively efficiently and stably can make something. So it's not that we can't make, it's not that we're trying to make some product that's never been made before. The problem is the competition. It is so cheap and so large scale already that are, I mean, it's, you know, I agree. I mean, there's not a thermodynamic or fundamental scientific reason we can't do these things, but in terms of cost, I mean, even if we throw a billion dollars at it, it's still going to be way cheaper for Shell or Exxon to continue what they're doing, pay their carbon taxes and they will be just fine financially, which is, you know, we have to remind ourselves of business is involved in this.
