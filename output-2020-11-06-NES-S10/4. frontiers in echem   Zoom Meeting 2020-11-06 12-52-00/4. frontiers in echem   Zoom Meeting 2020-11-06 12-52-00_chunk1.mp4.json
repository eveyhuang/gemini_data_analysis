Uh there's a problem that that's happening inside that those those devices that is not letting us necessarily, you know, zip that cusp. So, is that really not the case for um these reactions of transformation of greenhouse gases into something that then you can use to get it out of the atmosphere? Is it just a matter of incentives?

And as you scale up CO2 electrolysis, whether you use uh something like Ocus 12, which is a pem electrolyzer in acid or something like dioxide, which is alkaline. Um as you scale this up to, you know, more than 10 to 50,000 units of production, the major cost in both of those systems is the membranes. So the idea that catalyst cost is not uh it's it's nothing. Even the bipolar plates are a small thing, separations aren't too bad if we can do this well. But for both of them, the real limiting step is the cost of membranes and both the the base materials, but then also the manufacturing at large scale. So I think that's where we can kind of, you know, look at which, you know, how did batteries get 10x cheaper in 10 years? Was it the cathodes that got cheaper? Was it a better electrolyte? I think we can learn, you know, like people have said from these other fields, how did they improve efficiency, reduce costs? Usually it's a material component or stability or durability. And and for electrolyzers, we I mean, all the modeling points in any case, whether we do this in alkaline conditions, the membranes are going to be the driver for for the cost.",

So for the alkaline electrolysis, people are not making that at the same scale. So we actually use the same scaling relations for, you know, uh Sustainion or something like that versus Nafion. So the assumption is that even if it scales, you know, an alkaline membrane scales the same way as a Nafion, which it may or may not, even if it does, it's still the major cost driver. I I think up to 10 to 50,000 units of production. So pretty pretty high priority.",

So what are the membrane costs for for this what's the scale? Like is it But is it is it like off order 10? Is it off order like how how much could we reduce, right? I think that's that's sort of getting to Kelsey's point, right?

He's going to come out much worse than I mean it, but um in all these models, there's the assumption that technology and performance stays constant in a sense, right? It's a pure scale, you know, to to a to a degree was a big player in the battery cost lowering because the chemistry hasn't really changed much. Um but that, you know, assumes that you cannot do better performance device, right? There's probably a metric of dollar per unit of something. That unit of something is related to your ability to do the reaction. Um and that assumes that you cannot do the reaction faster or um you know, using less energy or uh more selectively so that you don't have to separate. And so that then takes you back to the way you're doing the reaction. And are we convinced that we cannot do better? Because I don't know that anybody I mean, you know, Wilson, you'll tell me, uh is are these technologies that you evaluate based on cascade reactions like Jenny was proposing?",

Now for techno economic assessment, um we actually do a sensitivity analysis to see which operational or material parameters would lead to the biggest shift in costs. And there we see that the biggest drivers are the single pass conversion efficiency and the current density. Now the issue with that is that if you look in literature, those are things where it's kind of like whack-mole. If somebody can do very good current current density, they have very low single pass conversion. If they have very good single pass, they have low current. So in the end, ideally would like them both. And then that is to us a frontier is that how can you do both of those things at the same time? And that takes I don't think that that's going to be solved by a cascade reaction. I think that's going to be reactor engineering and process integration that's going to solve that, not not a cascade on a catalyst.",
