So I wonder if we just need a Haldor Topsoe on steroids, right? I mean, Haldor Topsoe is a 100-year-old company, or whatever, not 100 years old, I mean, but anyway, it's a 70-year-old company, right? So, and it's very Scandinavian, right? Very Danish. So, I wonder if if if it's you know, whatever, right? I mean, a modernized version of of of Haldor Topsoe could just like bootstrap this field, right?",

I mean, there's no there's no great I mean, I think the the the you know, the long-term view doesn't exist, right? Which is why you need someone to raise obscene amounts of capital so that you don't have you don't need a long-term view, right? There's only there's only one of two ways you can do it, right? Like, you don't need to take a long-term view because someone will bankroll if you know, if if you know, if investors don't come, you know, someone can say, I'll just put my own money in, right? So I think that I think that big difference is what drives the sort of short versus long term. And Topsoe being a private company has been able to do that, right? Haldor, I guess the family still owns a significant portion, which allows them to make these kinds of decisions compared to yeah, compared to those that have to answer to Wall Street.",
