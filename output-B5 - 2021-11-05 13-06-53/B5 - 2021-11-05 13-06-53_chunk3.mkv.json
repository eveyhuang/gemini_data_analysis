And I think that's also a challenge. So those kinetics if those kinetics are relevant to the mechanism, then the question is how do you capture them in in in in in a in a model. And and again, this is not a critique. Obviously, the field is advancing slowly, slowly, slowly. But but I think",

The convection is not perhaps as significant, but in electrochemistry, aqueous electrochemistry, that's the case.",

So I think so that's sort of the strength of um of dimensionless analysis that it it's really doesn't care what is the molecule that you're putting in. But and yet it allows you to to describe that relation of how is it that mass moves towards the surface to a surface and then how is it that the products that you make move away. Is that that that answer your question?",

So what I'm trying to understand is because ultimately what we're trying to do, whatever model that we we have at hand, we want to be able for it to be somehow transferable between different systems, between different reactants or different type of materials. And ultimately, if we have that transferability, we want to use it for some kind of a prediction, right? So in my opinion, transferability comes first and then you have some kind of a prediction, right? So that was why I was just wondering since I'm you know, I've read about it, but I'm not",

So rate of reaction to rate of diffusion, for example. So if we find that number to be very high, it's it's very evident that the process is diffusion limited, which means that your model can account for the diffusion in that part of the system rather than the reaction which just means that",
