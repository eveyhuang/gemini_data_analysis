I mean, I know you can do this for higher CO2 streams as a way to sort of just increase it passively on this side. But is there anything that's good enough to do that for air or is this ridiculous?",

Traditionally, why we use membranes for high pressure gas mixture separations and absorptive type separations for really low pressure mixtures. Along those lines though, I mean, there may be other ways of thinking about using membranes. I mean, I think the objective here is to think about some really crazy new directions. So I don't want to shut down that. I'm not saying that. I'm just saying what traditional membrane problems would be.",

So many of us in this room work on CO2 reduction. So one of the things that we've thought about is instead of reducing CO2, let's reduce the alkox. It would be an alkyl carbonate or carbamate, right? These are the products of CO2 capture with amines and hydroxides or alkoxides, respectively. And if we could just directly reduce it from there, that's a solution. And I would argue that some of the CO2 reduction alkaline cells basically do that, right? Because you're probably not reducing directly CO2, but you're reducing bicarbonate or carbonate at those pHs. And so I think that is an interesting approach, and so sort of just reshifting our thinking about CO2 reduction to reducing bound CO2 to some of these capture agents directly. And then related to that, I realized there's no geochemist in the room, but I know that in sequestration, right? There's certain minerals that are, this is my limited knowledge, that are stable to bury underground. And so can we electrochemically generate the precursors to these minerals to then directly synthesize them, capture, and then just bury that? And so those are just some of my thoughts, is that maybe we don't want to regenerate, we just want to make the product directly from the CO2 that's captured.",

And is there any, and this is really a question to the room, is there any interest in selectively separating the carbonate rather than you're just doing a simple pH swing somehow electrochemically or chemically? And then can you, would it be useful to separate the carbonate selectively and then use that?",

So maybe some sort of building material perhaps, then you know, then the application changes entirely. But for example, carbon engineering was mentioned, and they basically do this process where they have CO2 react with hydroxide, and then they precipitate the, precipitate a solid with calcium carbonate. But perhaps you could go to some other solid products, not solid calcium carbonate, but solid something else, which is potentially more useful than calcium carbonate. But one of the things I always thought, well, with some of the mineralization stuff is that, okay, you make a, you take the CO2 out, and now it's a solid that you can easily dispose of. But can you make a solid that's as useful, if not more, than some of the traditional products of CO2 reduction, electro reduction? That's an open question.",

It's pretty easy to make cement other ways, so there's some question as to sort of what kind of cost numbers you need to hit, but that, that's a possibility.",

One, David just touched on on basically CO2 conversion or capture into solids. Something that we somewhat started doing in our lab. I'm not sure if oxalates are any more useful than carbonates, but it's something that has been pursued in the literature about 20 or 30 years ago, and it's actually doable, basically doing electrochemical conversion of CO2 to oxalates, which is a solid. And then another point, the solid state chemist and me immediately starts thinking about, well, if I wanted to give a surface to Phil or to Jenny so they could do their reactions, what would it be? And I'm guessing whether or not if there's an opportunity here for nitrite-based porous or nitrite-based moths or nitrite-based types of materials that can perhaps give us the opportunity to create that amine that we've been talking about. I mean, there's been some success. I'm not sure if we are all convinced of the success of doing nitrogen reduction using nitrite-based materials. And then that sort of leads me to perhaps a super off idea of how about if we could, we know that flue gas has a lot of nitrogen in there and very little CO2. So who knows if we could like have a double whammy here where we do CO2 recovery of flue gas on the nitrite surface that will take the majority of the nitrogen of the flue gas and convert it",
