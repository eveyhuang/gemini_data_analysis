            "transcript": "A lot of times when you think about technology advancement, you know, while direct air capture might be the ultimate goal, it's unlikely that the first technology is going to be able to go after that. The nice thing about electrochemical technologies as compared to say thermochemical technologies that is it you could be more effective when you're smaller, right? Thermochemical technologies usually make a lot of hay when you're really large and can take advantage of sort of heat integration and infrastructure, right? And so, you know, one of the things is, are there applications that you could think about where electrochemical technologies or some of the things we're talking about here are uniquely positioned because I assume that in cabin capture, it's really just like, you know, alkaline pellets, right? Um, you know, Apollo 13 or something like that, right? And you know, if that's true, then the question would be, are there opportunities to kind of say, are there, can we sort of walk down the technology curve from let's say carbon capture to maybe in cabins to maybe buildings to eventually direct air capture?",

            "transcript": "Yeah, so actually it's a very interesting project. Um, it's not as challenging as direct air capture, but nonetheless, it has other challenges. So right now, uh they use Zeolites. So it's essentially a thermal regeneration. So uh there are problems with Zeolites though, um that I don't have to get into, but they are interested in uh sorbents uh as opposed to Zeolites. And you know, in cabin, you want something non-volatile, kind of kind of benign solvent. And um the good thing about we can think about also like pressure swing and and you know, in space vacuum is kind of free. So, uh there are some advantages on that front. But I think they are also interested ultimately, you know, maybe like scavenging oxygen out of CO2 like through a Bosch type of reaction. Um, but yeah, right now they are uh thermally regenerating at much higher cost actually for the Zeolites. Uh and they also have to scrub, they they have to um, you know, dry the air first because Zeolites are not really stable um with moisture. Um, I don't know. I think I missed your question.",

Are there other opportunities along the way down the CO2 concentration curve, for lack of a better word, where we could add a tremendous amount of value in terms of, you know, negative carbon emissions. Um, and what might those be?",

            "transcript": "So, so one thing that came to mind, comes to mind for me as well. Yeah, so direct capture is hard. You see you're taking, you know, you're capturing from 400 BPM and you want to go to one bar because you want to see crystal or uh convert. Um, if instead you still capture from air, but your requirement was only to go to like two or three percent, let's say, that concentration of CO2 would be useful if you were doing something like algae. So, like algae actually don't need to go all the way to 100%. If you if you get up to a couple percent, even 5%, um, they they can be pretty effective. So you can, you know, use it to do things like algae, um, like uh like fuels for aviation fuel or whatever. You can, you know, you can there's a whole bunch of other work engineering algae to make particular um products. But but that could be sort of another like a sort of a step down um the curve where you are doing CO2 capture. Um and it is useful uh because, you know, we're not going to get electric planes anytime soon. Um, but you're not you're not, you know, you don't have this massive concentration factor like 2500 or whatever it is. So that might be another way.",

Is there um an optimal scale at which to run these electrochemical processes? And is it, can you can you scale it down without any loss uh indefinitely? Like what's what what sizes matter?",

            "transcript": "It depends on the process a little bit, um, and it depends upon where your cost is in the process. So, for example, you could sort of think of it as flow batteries are an easy example because you can separate power and energy. And so if you want an energy intensive application, the cost is dominated by what's in your tank. Um, if you have a power dominant application, it's dominated by what the what it cost you to make the reactor. Uh in these kind of systems, it's a bit different, right? And it would probably the way you'd want to think about it is throughput, right? So it's kind of what is the capital cost of your reactor? And then how much CO2 can you put through it because that's how you're going to make money, right? Um, and so that's how you should think about it. I mean, capital cost is important because, you know, bank ability, like someone's got to pay for the thing, right? And so if you think about like the first solar cells, they they kind of stunk, right? But they're still working and they're small and you can put them on your roof, right? Um, and so, you know, if for electrochemical systems, you could build at that sort of scale, local residential scale, and that allows you to do a lot more learning um as you go, and allows you also to make smaller products, which mean that there's less opportunities for for screw ups and a lot less money involved. Um, for a lot of sort of, you know, the larger scale systems like I guess carbon engineering, I mean, I think that system is is is pretty big in the base case. And I don't know how many of them they've built. I'm not so I've seen a lot of pretty pictures, but I don't know if I've actually seen a plant. Um, and so there's some some something about like, well, who's paying for this? How confident are you that this is going to work? Yada yada yada, this kind of stuff, right? So I don't think electrochemical systems can be infinitely small for sure. Um, but you could be a lot smaller than thermochemical systems. And actually if you look at scaling analysis, thermochemical systems can beat out electrochemical systems at large enough scale, right? Just because of heat integration, we're really good at that. Um, but at smaller scales, um the tables turn.",

So, uh first I think we started off of degradation pathways and there was uh that's what sort of what set off the discussion. Um, about and then so I just put down those uh points there. Uh reactor format, I think we discussed a lot about uh what sort of uh electric engineering systems we do that. Uh I don't know if we we had like somebody made a good comment about, oh, electric chemical sorbents the best solution. Uh I thought that was a cool uh sort of insightful question on our own platform, but I don't know if you want to keep that. Uh I think that uh someone said it was a good uh opportunity to develop multifunctional materials. Uh maybe use a backbone. Uh actually no, it was an IL backbone of a redox active material. Um, then there were uh there was a lot of discussion from the chemistry side on uh can we increase nucleity? Uh but not increase over potential of uh quinones. Um, and then there was a good suggestion to maybe look at fenoxides or amines. Um, and then there was a whole discussion direct air capture, etc. and can we electrochemically generate an amine? Um, there was a good suggestion on oxide absorbents. Um, can we use it for um reactive separations, I guess? The thermo and then the encapsulation. And then there was a whole bunch of discussion everywhere on CO2 capture and conversion. So I put that down at the bottom.",
