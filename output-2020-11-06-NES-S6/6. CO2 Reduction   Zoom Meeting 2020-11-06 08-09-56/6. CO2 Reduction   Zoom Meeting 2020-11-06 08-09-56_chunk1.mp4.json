I'll pose I'll I guess I guess first first pose a question which is I think that might be useful to frame the discussion, which is what is a complete picture? I think that might be might be a good good one to sort of define very clearly. And in my mind, I'll give a first first pass which hopefully you will all agree, disagree with is, essentially, what are the what are the control variables, right? You have a particular catalyst, you have particular reaction conditions. So concentration of CO2, medium, electrolytes, etc. And then a range of different driving forces such as voltage. And then other sort of photon or or if you're thinking photocatalytic, then photon driven and maybe P photoelectro catalytic. So maybe those are combined. And so what we want to be able to say is, given control variables as well as driving forces, what will be the product distribution when product distribution of this reaction? That's sort of the highest order. And the second granularity would be that if you could understand exactly how that product was reached or or what were the what were the intermediate steps. So I think first might be a reasonable achievement even if that's done. The second would be obviously from a science perspective, second would be the more important achievement.",

What are the different pathways and how do we pick a pathway to go get your particular product, right?
