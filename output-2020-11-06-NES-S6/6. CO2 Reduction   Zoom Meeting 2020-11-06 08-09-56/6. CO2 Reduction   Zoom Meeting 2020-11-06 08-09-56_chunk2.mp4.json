            "transcript": "Yesterday from the UK climate, a woman was, you know, we need big solutions, we need them now. So I think for me because there's two other sections that are looking at mechanistic CO2 reduction, we should look at a bit bigger picture. And I think one of the things we should consider is maybe CO2 reduction directly won't make every product that we want it to. Maybe we're not going to be able to make methanol, ethanol, propanol. And so, understanding selectivity, I think, is still something that's very interesting and fundamental, but you know, I think to focus that could be the selectivity of CO2 reduction versus hydrogen evolution as one major bifurcation. And then, you know, what CO2 reduces to. I mean, my personal opinion is that at an industrial scale, electrochemical CO2 reduction at best will get us CO and formic acid, but I don't think at an industrial scale we're going to make any other product, and that's fine because I think the role that electrochemistry and electrochemical CO2 reduction can be making really stable robust precursors that can be converted by more, you know, advanced processes. So to me, you know, I think the discussion should be less about selectivity to kind of C2, C3, C4 products, but more this kind of intrinsic. One thing I think we all would agree, however we do this, water will be involved there somewhere and shutting off hydrogen evolution versus CO2 reduction as a main bottleneck. I think that could be something that is interesting for everyone.",

            "transcript": "I just wanted to lend support to this idea of reaction selectivity versus product selectivity. It's all about shutting down competitive HER. Well, maybe some people say that you can do syngas, but I think most of the techno-economic analysis says you either make clean CO and get hydrogen from another source to be economically viable, or you make clean formate and that syngas is not a good target economically. Um, whether, you know. But, um, regardless, I mean, I think reaction selectivity is the big driver, and if you can get it so you can make CO or formate, which would be even better just because it's in some ways it would be better, um, directly, which is much harder than all the rest of the stuff we can hydrogenate. We can hydrogenate CO2, but we can hydrogenate CO a little bit easier than CO2.",

So I think I'm coming at this more from the angle of a person that is not an expert in electrocatalysis and knows little about photocatalysis, right? But does do thermal catalysis. So, I guess, what is the comparison between electrocatalytic and photocatalytic processes versus thermal processes? Um, and in terms of let's say an electrocatalytic process, what kinds of faradaic efficiencies are we talking that would make these kinds of processes comparable to thermal catalytic processes or is that not even a worthwhile question, right? That's something that I'm curious about and since there are folks on the meeting that know more about electro and photocatalysis, that's something that I would love to learn more about.",
