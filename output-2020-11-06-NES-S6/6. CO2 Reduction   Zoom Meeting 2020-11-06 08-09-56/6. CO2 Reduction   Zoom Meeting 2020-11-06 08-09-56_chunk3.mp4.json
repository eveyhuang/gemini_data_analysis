And the bio people kept on saying the electro catalytic routes were so much more advanced and better from, like, so everyone was like referring to like the bio routes as like ideal. But like if you can make acetate and feed acetate to a bio, like that might be one way to do that. But I've heard mixed things about the bio routes.",

So I think, you know, conventional, conventional electro catalysis, right? I mean, you probably have turnovers at the level of like one and four atoms or one and maybe eight, ten atoms on the surface, right? I mean, that's sort of the, the coverage at which reaction turnovers are happening. So, and, and it may become like one in 100 or one in 1000 if it becomes bio, which, which then, what that means is the reactor then scales by 10x or 100x, right, for producing the same product. So you have to catch up by being 100x more efficient in turnover frequency, which is a very, I mean, that's a hard challenge, right? So you have to be, and usually that factor is more like a million, I think. That's, that's sort of the, that's sort of the ballpark that I'm used to.

            "transcript": "Ellen, I would, I would add to what Venkat is saying is that if I look at traditional large-scale processes, industry folks would generally use a time scale of your turnover. It's much easier to say what's infeasible than to say what is feasible. And if the time scale of your turnover is on the order of hours typically, that's not going to translate or scale well to an industrial process. So that's sort of a ballpark, not strict number, but, but a good rule of thumb in industrial processes.",

Maybe I'm biased because this is what I work on, but you can take a molecular catalyst that you know does this like a, a, an N4 catalyst and put it in polymers that mimic a lot of this, which is cheaper. It mimics all of the delivery and you can get, and then you still have low site density, but you can build up layers of this on the surface. You can build vertically and you can get these three, basically 3D architectures of these polymer catalyst composites.",
