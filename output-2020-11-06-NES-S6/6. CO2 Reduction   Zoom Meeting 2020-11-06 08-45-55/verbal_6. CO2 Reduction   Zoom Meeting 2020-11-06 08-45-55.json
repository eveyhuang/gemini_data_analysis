        "utterance": "WS: So a comment coming back to what's been discussed a lot is Jimmy and Venkat you're discussing kind of techno economic type of things and costs of catalyst and Venkat you brought up Opus 12 and Dioxide. So we work with both of those companies and NREL we've done pretty extensive techno economic and life cycle assessment of various CO2 processes. And what we see is when you get to scale, the cost of the catalyst is nothing. We assume that every catalyst will be bulk copper. So it absolutely is not the catalyst cost and for PEM electrolysis where you have platinum and iridium based catalyst, that's a huge driver. But for CO2 reduction, it's not. And so what we find is regardless if we do the Opus 12 approach is using PEM electrolysis essentially with CO2 catalyst. So it's an acidic environment and Dioxide is alkaline electrolysis with CO2. And in both cases when we get to the economy of scales, whether it's acidic or basic, the major cost driver and the major cost at these systems is the cost of the membranes. And so I think as we for this room of a complete picture of CO2 reduction, I think membranes is a huge thing, especially alkaline exchange membranes in terms of separations, stability, managing pHs. But we even find in the manufacturing that at large scales when we get to over 10,000 units made of any of these systems, including things like bipolar plates, recirculation. So the first thing is that membranes is something I think that is huge and important for this field. The other thing is that Venkat you're mentioning that the price of electricity and how we kind of distill that into metrics in the lab that are the most relevant that are correlated to that. The two metrics we see that are the biggest knobs to turn are the single pass conversion efficiency and the current density. So current density and it's a challenge, I think, a big challenge for the field and that those two metrics seem to be counterproductive to each other. If you increase the current density, usually you decrease the single pass conversion and vice versa, if you have low flow rates to have a higher conversion efficiency, you're going to have lower currents. So we see that the biggest economic knobs to turn are the membrane costs and the biggest performance metrics are current density and single pass. ",
