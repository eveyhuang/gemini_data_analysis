            "transcript": "If you're going to form carbonates, you really want to form calcium carbonate or magnesium carbonate because they're the least soluble and they'll drop out of your solution pretty quickly. If you try to form, you know, sodium carbonate, bicarbonate, potassium, group one carbonates, they still tend to stick around. In which case, you need to do an anti-solvent crystallization approach where you'd want to use ethanol to precipitate out a more soluble salt. So there are ways to work around it. The challenge really is this low solubility of CO2 in water in general. So there are ways to accelerate that, then that can, I think that would really address the challenge related to ocean capture too.",

If you do it enough, if you pull enough CO2, you can drive that reaction and actually make kind of this sand-like material. Um, so, yeah, like you said, it makes a lot of sense if you're trying to like, uh, you know, remove more CO2, you can actually drive that precipitation reaction.",
