In the context of direct air capture, how important are entropic contributions? Like in terms, you know, in terms of the energetic input, should we even, does it even make sense for us to think about engineering materials for an entropic capture point of view, or does it simply make sense for us to just think about trying to engineer the enthalpic component of it?

But like Chris said, I think it is a very unexplored kind of area. It's less obvious to me. I mean, usually enthalpy and entropy of absorption should be quite highly correlated, just the more strong of a binding site you have for the gas, the more constrained it's going to be on the surface. And so there's usually not that much you can really do, which is why maybe it makes sense just to focus on binding energy because the entropy is just going to kind of tag along. But that's where I think if you have more dynamic absorbents or absorbents and things that respond and are not just inert materials, but actually change in terms of their dynamics or structure as a function of CO2 partial pressure, then you open up opportunities for thinking about engineering entropy.

One of the challenging things about direct air capture is, you know, we're we're stuck with, um, 400 ppm, uh, CO2. But one of the things I haven't seen discussed a lot is if you imagine deploying direct air capture in different places around the world, you can imagine having conditions that range from, say, minus 20 to 40 degrees C. So if you were asked to try to do something with CO2 at 400 ppm at minus 20 degrees C, how would you think about doing that differently from, you know, the ambient conditions that we're normally used to thinking about indoors, 25 degrees C, you know, 30% relative humidity. And similarly, if you were designing, uh, a process that could operate in, you know, Oman in the middle of summer, you know, you you might be dealing with 35, 40 degrees C, uh, ambient temperatures. Um, so I just throw that out there as a way to maybe stir different ideas. This is a challenge where we're going to probably have 10 or 20 or 50 solutions that might be customized to different locations around the globe.

So we've been looking at pathways to couple direct air capture with carbon mineralization, specifically with the intent of trying to produce carbonates. And one way to do that is to use conventional sorbents that are cheap. So you could use amino acid solvents like sodium glycine or even MEA. And so you have a high concentration of carbonate ions that you can now react with your calcium or magnesium, produce calcium, magnesium carbonate, have sufficiently high hydroxyl ions, so you can regenerate your solvent. So you have for a one pot process with internal recycling, internal pH swinging. So that's so that really drives down the cost of capture and mineralization, but it needs higher temperatures because of the thermodynamics of CO2 absorption because you're trying to couple absorption and crystallization. This is a process that would not work in very cold climates. Like if you're trying to do this in the Arctic, there simply is not going to be enough thermodynamic driving force for that. Uh there are other approaches to couple mineralization. So for example, again, if you're trying to feed CO2 to an algae pond, depends again where that algae pond is going to be located, if it's going to be located in a temperate region versus in a really cold climate. So cold climate is a real challenge and I am not entirely sure what subset of solutions can be deployed there. But if you but I do think there are a set of solutions that can be deployed in more temperate and tropical regions. Uh so that's my two cents on the thinking and we do a lot of thinking around this space, so I'd be very keen on hearing what we can actually do in really cold regions. ",

But it's a great question, Chris. I mean, just the issue of temperature variation and humidity variation. I mean, there are really wide ranges for all of those throughout the globe. And the more I was thinking about it, I'm like picturing the globe. I'm like, most of the sparse, you know, countries are in cold climates and there's a lot of land that we could probably use for these systems there. So maybe it even makes sense to kind of think ahead about, okay, if we're building 10 gigatons of direct air capture, where's it going to go? It might have to go to those places. ",

If you try to form, you know, sodium carbonate, bicarbonate, potassium, group one carbonates, they still tend to stick around. In which case, you need to do an anti-solvent crystallization approach where you'd want to use ethanol to precipitate out a more soluble salt. So there are ways to work around it.
