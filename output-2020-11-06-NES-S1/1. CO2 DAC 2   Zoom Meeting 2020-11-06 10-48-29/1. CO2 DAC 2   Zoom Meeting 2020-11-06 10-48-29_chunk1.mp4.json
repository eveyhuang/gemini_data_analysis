So in the context of trying to actually capture CO2 from air, there is the entropic contribution, which is, you know, trying to bind the CO2 to the surface, and then there is the entropic contribution where we can effectively engineer a substrate so we can, you know, lock the CO2 molecule into that particular pore space. In the context of direct air capture, how important are entropic contributions? Like in terms, you know, in terms of the energetic input, should we even, does it even make sense for us to think about engineering materials for an entropic capture point of view, or does it simply make sense for us to just think about trying to engineer the enthalpic component of it? That is, so I wasn't sure what the current thinking is along those lines.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I mean, I think you pay a really large entropic penalty, right, for CO2 going from being free in the gas phase to confined on a surface. And so if you can do anything by inducing an increase in the entropy of a material when it binds CO2 to kind of compensate for that, then you can, you know, favor the absorption of more CO2 and potentially higher capacities at these lower partial pressures. But like Chris said, I think it is a very unexplored kind of area. It's less obvious to me. I mean, usually enthalpy and entropy of absorption should be quite highly correlated, just the more strong of a binding site you have for the gas, the more constrained it's going to be on the surface. And so there's usually not that much you can really do, which is why maybe it makes sense just to focus on binding energy because the entropy is just going to kind of tag along. But that's where I think if you have more dynamic absorbents or absorbents and things that respond and are not just inert materials, but actually change in terms of their dynamics or structure as a function of CO2 partial pressure, then you open up opportunities for thinking about engineering entropy.",

If there are correlations, obvious correlations with respect to enthalpy, what might those relationships look like? Are there limits in terms of performance in these unconventional solvent absorbent type systems that we can now start to quantify or maybe try to get a handle on?

We can literally distinguish between them by running, you know, a lot of simulations as well. So this can also come in to guide some of the initial experiments, and then maybe, you know, experiments can guide the similar theory again. You know, that has to be a cycle, right? That has to be a cycle to refine it. So that is a very interesting route, and something, you know, I would agree. Basic energy point of view, definitely, you know, really appealing. Can I ask a question based on that? Because a lot of the computational material screening for separations that I'm familiar with leverages the fact that people work with primarily crystalline materials that allows for this high throughput screening to be more effective. Absolutely. If we're if we're talking about materials where we want to look at entropic terms, there's a higher likelihood that we're going to be dealing with amorphous domains. And I and I, not being a computational scientist, I'm I'm less aware about how amenable those types of materials are, you know, less crystalline materials to these sort of high throughput techniques.",
