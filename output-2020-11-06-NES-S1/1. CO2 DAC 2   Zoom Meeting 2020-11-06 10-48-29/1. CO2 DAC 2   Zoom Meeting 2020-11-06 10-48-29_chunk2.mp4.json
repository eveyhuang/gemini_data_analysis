Simply because if you are looking at thermodynamics, DFT is really good, but if you're looking at system sizes and nanocrystalline materials, it's sometimes not feasible in the realm of the computational power. And often when you're going to kinetics, either is there is a scaling from what the DFT method you are using or you need to really run simulations at high temperature and then understand the mechanisms.",

Um, you know, in a lot of engineered systems, you have control over temperature, pressure, other parameters. One of the challenging things about direct air capture is, you know, we're we're stuck with, um, 400 ppm, uh, CO2. But one of the things I haven't seen discussed a lot is if you imagine deploying direct air capture in different places around the world, you can imagine having conditions that range from, say, minus 20 to 40 degrees C. So if you were asked to try to do something with CO2 at 400 ppm at minus 20 degrees C, how would you think about doing that differently from, you know, the ambient conditions that we're normally used to thinking about indoors, 25 degrees C, you know, 30% relative humidity. And similarly, if you were designing, uh, a process that could operate in, you know, Oman in the middle of summer, you know, you you might be dealing with 35, 40 degrees C, uh, ambient temperatures. Um, so I just throw that out there as a way to maybe stir different ideas. This is a challenge where we're going to probably have 10 or 20 or 50 solutions that might be customized to different locations around the globe. So, would you change your way of thinking if you were stuck working at minus 10 C or or 40 C? So I'll just throw that out there as a possible question.",

            "transcript": "Chris, my short answer to that is absolutely yes. So we've been looking at pathways to couple direct air capture with carbon mineralization, specifically with the intent of trying to produce carbonates. And one way to do that is to use conventional sorbents that are cheap. So you could use amino acid solvents like sodium glycine or even MEA. And so you have a high concentration of carbonate ions that you can now react with your calcium or magnesium, produce calcium, magnesium carbonate, have sufficiently high hydroxyl ions, so you can regenerate your solvent. So you have for a one pot process with internal recycling, internal pH swinging. So that's so that really drives down the cost of capture and mineralization, but it needs higher temperatures because of the thermodynamics of CO2 absorption because you're trying to couple absorption and crystallization. This is a process that would not work in very cold climates. Like if you're trying to do this in the Arctic, there simply is not going to be enough thermodynamic driving force for that. Uh there are other approaches to couple mineralization. So for example, again, if you're trying to feed CO2 to an algae pond, depends again where that algae pond is going to be located, if it's going to be located in a temperate region versus in a really cold climate. So cold climate is a real challenge and I am not entirely sure what subset of solutions can be deployed there. But if you but I do think there are a set of solutions that can be deployed in more temperate and tropical regions. Uh so that's my two cents on the thinking and we do a lot of thinking around this space, so I'd be very keen on hearing what we can actually do in really cold regions.",

            "transcript": "I think from the perspective of like microporous absorbents, I think it's probably actually the opposite for just conventional absorption processes and that colder climates are probably a lot easier than um hotter climates just in that um in designing you can design binding sites that have much lower affinities for CO2 and still be able to achieve very high selectivities just because um there's less thermal energy available. So the boltzmann distribution is going to favor CO2 going to um you don't need as large of a delta E between different gas molecules to drive a lot of CO2 um into a material. It's the regeneration piece though that that's less clear to me exactly how that changes. I think selectivity and capacity are a lot easier. Um you can have weaker binding sites. Um but whether or not that actually leads to benefits on the regeneration side when you're already colder, um I have to think a little bit more about. I guess if you're in a cold climate but you had some geothermal heat source or something readily available then you um that might offer a lot of advantages.",

I think that will probably not affect the energetics too much because the potential is a really strong driving force, but it would change all the different apparatus and the especially the solvent because uh most of the solvents that we use will probably solidify. So, um, we might have to change the whole architecture to have something that is um basically not solvent dependent. Like hopefully it's all immobilized and everything is just ionic, um, without like a flowing solvent. Um, so that's a really good question, actually. That's a really good, um, context for electrochemist to explore. I don't know if ionic liquids might be the best electrolyte then because they're they have a bigger range at a version can. I don't know what their phase transition is.",

I'm like, most of the sparse, you know, countries are in cold climates and there's a lot of land that we could probably use for these systems there.
