So I think a lot of it has been on this type of quinone type chemistries that have a certain potential and stability. And then we were thinking and I think it's something that my group and from the more polymeric type perspective be interested in is to see if there's some other chemistries like nitrogen heteroatoms that when you do the redox, you can actually have it at higher overpotentials and less parasitic side reactions. So that was one of the things that we're sort of interested in.",

You'll hear me talk about ionic liquids a lot, so that's what we work on. But, um, we're also looking at encapsulated ionic liquids. Um, and I think one of the issues there is, you know, we have to worry about the pressure drop and, um, think about alternative ways how to bring energy in and out relatively smoothly in these materials. So, um, thermal regeneration, you know, we may we may need to think about some other mechanisms that aid in thermal regeneration. So, um, you know, some of those sorbents like zeolites, you know, they they require significantly high regeneration temperatures and like ionic liquid capsules definitely lowers that. Um, but still, can we think about other ways to bring energy into the system for regeneration? So, um, I mean, the things that I have in mind and you can I guess it's not really thinking outside of the box too much, but you know, microwave radiation, radio frequency radiation, or even plasma assisted regeneration, um, Sharma mentioned electrochemical regeneration. Um, we can, you know, certainly make these capsule shells, uh, to be conductive and that's how we can bring that in.",

That's a little bit different from electrochemical capture in the liquid phase is that for CO2, there's a reaction and then that makes your energy of regeneration very high. So if there's some way that we can use some sort of weaker affinity that would still have selectivity, that would make a regeneration a lot more efficient. So like in the liquid phase, you have these weaker interactions. So your potential swing that you have to, your free energy swing is a lot less. But then for CO2, and then maybe it's a catch 22 and can't solve it because the concentration is so low for direct air capture. But if there's some way that we can think of to use other mechanisms other than like a reaction that captures the CO2 and changes it and then regenerates it, it would be more efficient for electrochemistry. But that's an open question.",

I quickly wanted to add that there's been a lot of, uh, very exciting developments happening in the space of direct air capture. But perhaps in terms of thinking about future advancements, maybe we think about DAC to X, uh, that can be a material of choice, that can be, you know, a suite of products of choice, what have you. And in and in getting from DAC to X, there could be, uh, pathways that don't necessarily involve the use of one optimal tech technology. There could be a set of hybrid technologies that can get us from DAC to X. Some of them could be electrochemical, some of them could be hybrid absorption, crystallization, absorption, crystallization, membrane coupled with crystallization, depends on what that X is. And maybe this is a good opportunity for us to think about the translation of DAC to X and then thinking about the concentrations that we need in order to make X and the pathway to get to that, which may not necessarily just be one technology, but could be one optimal technology to get there.",

Um, but I I want to also, um, echo what Grishma just said. And I also want to mention too, don't forget that we can calculate the minimum work for any separation process, um, which is the thermodynamic minimum. Uh, and and so one way to think about that is that final concentration of CO2. If you're starting off at the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere and you're getting it to say 99% purity because you want to transport the CO2 in a liquid phase. But suppose that instead of transporting it in liquid phase, you want to use it and convert it as a feedstock to something else. So I would ask the question, what is the lowest purity that you actually need to get the CO2 to as the feedstock? Are you crystallizing it, you know, mineralizing it like Grishma just mentioned, are you turning it into a fuel? Uh, how low could you actually go to get the conversions you need to that to that X? And I think that that is an interesting parameter that's not often exploited because so many of us just look at thinking about transporting the CO2, but you might not have to. And that's something to I think think about.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, that that's a point I wanted to pick you back off of because we had a related discussion in a different breakout room. I'm David Kwabi from University of Michigan, Mechanical Engineering. So, uh, if you do the minimum work calculation for capturing CO2 from air to one bar, it looks pretty, uh, promising. It's like 20 kilojoules per mole or something like that. Um, but in reality, it's going to be you're going to have to spend a lot more energy, um, because you have a massive concentration factor to deal with. But if you want it, for example, to this is like, you know, say do jet fuel instead. Um, let's say we're not we're not going to get electric planes anytime soon. So, um, let's say your target was jet fuel and you wanted to use microbes like algae to do it. You actually don't need to go go all the way to 100%. Um, they can be pretty effective at like a couple percent, like 2%, 5%. So you can envision a situation where you're taking CO2 from air, but you're feeding it to algae, which are, you know, maybe not effective at 400 ppm, but super effective at 25%. Um, and then you're you have a useful end product as a result. So it kind of let it, you know, you're a little less constrained in terms of how high you need to go in concentration factor, um, but you're still effective, um, at doing something useful. So that's a sort of an end application driven, uh, design of of your DAC system.",

So you save a lot of energy and that energy directly translates to the operating costs. So it's, um, it's an interesting tunable parameter. Any other hierarchies or architectures that people want to talk about? I really liked the concept that Burcu, like that you had mentioned about, um, when we think about membranes, we often think, well, that doesn't work for direct air capture because you don't have a driving force. But when you think about a contained liquid membrane, you're combining, um, approaches. It's it's your combining something like absorption with a membrane separation process and and maybe there's benefits of thinking about the heat transfer across different systems, whether it's a packed bed or a membrane or a fluid in a in a packed bed. So maybe, you know, any any thoughts on some of these kind of hybrid approaches?",

One of the ideas that, um, I've been thinking about, um, and I know Jen and I, we had talked about this previously, but was using metal nanoparticles deposited on membranes, uh, as a way of concentrating onto on the CO2 side. So the concept being you have something that, you know, has a high affinity to absorb onto a metallic surface, then you might be able to use what's used in the catalytic world as, uh, spillover effect where essentially is a sync that you absorb onto the nanoparticle, then spill over onto the membrane or you're locally concentrated at that interface. So then there's your concentration gradient across a membrane. So, uh, similar to what Burcu was talking about using, uh, captured liquid, but nanoparticles.",
