If you have tiny amounts of it, I I've no I don't know if that's been done, but if I tiny little amounts in absorbent and then you maybe just raise a potential, which is actually not that compared to CO2 capture, uh it's not that high the potential for water splitting. You just raise it to 1 volt and then you just break down the water and then produce a little bit of side gases. Um might not be feasible at all, but it's just an idea.",

And then uh rather than using thermal energy to desorb, uh you change the hydration state by bringing in humid gas or liquid water. And that uh liberates the CO2 and you're essentially swinging between a carbonate and a bicarbonate in this process. Now, but then you now have a quaternary ammonium polymer that's in the humid humid state and in order to reabsorb and to restart the next cycle, you've got to remove a lot of water from a highly charged polar surface. And there's significant energy associated with doing that. And there's also significant kinetics associated with doing that and cycling the material quickly.",
