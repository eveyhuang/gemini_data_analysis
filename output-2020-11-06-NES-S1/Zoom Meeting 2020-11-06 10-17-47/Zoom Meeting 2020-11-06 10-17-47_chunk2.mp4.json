            "transcript": "Maintaining CO2 absorption to some type of change in your material, some type of phase transition. So in micro pore absorbment, for example, rather than like the classical zeolite that maintains its exact structure even when it becomes in contact with CO2. If CO2 can induce a change in your absorbent, then if the thermodynamics of that phase transition or change in the absorbent are in the right way, they can mitigate some of the, for example, exothermic heat of absorption or endothermic heat of desorption for removing CO2. And I know people have done a little bit of similar types of things in the context of ionic liquids with looking at either precipitation reactions or some type of phase injection that can be coupled to CO2 absorption in an ionic liquid that just gives you another kind of knob to tune to try to access different thermodynamics than you would have if you were just focused on conventional kind of absorption or absorption.",

That also reminds me a bit of battery technology as well, where you're physically combining the electrochemistry side with the transport of lithium ion into one place and capturing and absorbing it onto an electrode, a highly porous surface material there. Could you do that with some type of hierarchical mineral material? That'd be kind of cool.",

So I might not have all the context, but is the idea to have some kind of electro active cathode or sorbent material that could be switched, triggered electrochemically to mineralize CO2?",

            "transcript": "Is that directed more at me or at Andrew? Sorry. I think we combined it. I took your idea and used, I don't think you implied that it was an electrochemical approach. I think you were saying, you know, there's a thermal transition or just a concentration driven transition. But I teased out the idea of, could you actually have that phase change induced electrochemically? Is what I kind of added to that or questioned about it. Yeah, I think that's an interesting approach that I hadn't really considered before. What I was referring to is more just a phase transition that's induced by absorption or absorption in this orbit material. So usually some type of structural phase transition or could also be, what specifically is coming into mind are certain metal organic frameworks that adopt rigid structures that have covalently attached flexible kind of amine groups on their surface that can bind chemically to CO2. And those amine groups are very dynamic and kind of moving all around in the absence of carbon dioxide. But when you get enough carbon dioxide such that you surpass a certain threshold partial pressure, it induces a phase transition in the amines so that they basically undergo effectively like a precipitation reaction and you form chains of ammonium carbonate. And so the thermodynamics of that phase transition are basically the opposite of the thermodynamics of CO2 absorption. And so that can reduce basically the overall net enthalpy change while you're still achieving a really high capacity and selectivity. So that's one example that comes to mind. There's other types of demonstrations with flexible metal organic frameworks where you have basically structures that are non-porous. And then when you achieve a certain threshold pressure of CO2 or gas on the outside of the framework, they expand to accommodate the gas. And that expansion again has the opposite thermodynamics, opposite enthalpy entropy change as absorption of the gas. And so that can provide some benefits in terms of minimizing temperature fluctuations during absorption and desorption. And I think similar types of things are possible in ionic liquids with precipitation reactions. But I think it's kind of been underexplored phase space in general. And so there's probably more opportunities for other types of mechanisms like Andrew suggested where you could have benefits and access properties that you wouldn't be able to have if you just have a simple kind of absorption or absorption process.",

            "transcript": "And I just wanted to add to Jared's point that there's so much exciting science to be done when we look at phase changing sorbents. So we have a recent paper looking at how we can use guanidian bases. This is in collaboration with some of the folks at Oakridge National Lab, where you have this, we actually sorb it in a liquid phase and then you form carbonate bonds, which cause the sorbent, the solvent has now become a solid, a crystallized solid. So then you crystallize it out and it has a much lower temperature of regeneration compared to the conventional carbonate. It's a water heavy system, but then when you work on systems like that, there are all these unconventional crystallization pathways and absorption pathways and coupling mechanisms that really open up new areas of fundamental science. So maybe direct air capture can serve as a pathway for unlocking some of those basic science questions too.",

So, I mean, the ionic liquid example is great, doesn't have water, but the problem is those phase changes really gets induced at partial pressures of CO2 that are way higher than 410 ppm. So we'll have to pre-condense somehow for that to happen. But I think the underlying theme of having manipulations through the entropy term in the thermodynamics overall, I think is very appealing. And maybe this could be induced, some people mentioned like electrochemically or some other stimuli.",

            "transcript": "And I think going back to this sort of, I guess, if you're making crystalline materials and you want to make them electrochemically, I think the one problem that we were discussing last time is, how do you make it that you can use it directly in the gas phase without a liquid? Because then you don't have any counter ions. So the architecture of making it might be also like a challenge itself. So like a lot of the absorbent systems that are being done electrochemically now, they're done with some sort of liquid phase. But I feel like from the discussions, it sounds like if you can get rid of that liquid and have a direct gas stream passing by, if we can do that, that's more efficient, except you always need this sort of ionic conductivity. So how do you design something like that with new materials? It's a little bit of a challenge. So few folks have done it a little bit using polymeric materials and then using membranes like fuel cells and stuff. But if you want to have some sort of crystal, you have to impregnate it with something that has a counter ion. So that becomes like a design challenge as well.",

Another way to think about this is if you can imagine a train of separations. How would you think about the problem differently if you remove the constraint of dealing with water? So you remove water from the system. Or how would you think about the problem differently if you could remove oxygen from the system? And that might be another way to stir creative ideas where you might imagine a train of separations where, for example, you take water out first and then you go after the CO2, or you take oxygen out first and then you go after the CO2. And I think it definitely complicates things, but it also might lead to some creative ideas in the basic science space.",
