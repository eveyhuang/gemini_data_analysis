So just getting into it quickly the the few things I had written down is that um you know, this this kind of comes directly from the questions but water, you know, we think of it as so central to life, but like it's worth considering other solvents, you know, like if we're thinking about Titan or methane or other things like that and I think that per Dimitar's comment about um, you know, how is this even relevant to life on earth? I think that the other solvent question could be relevant to life on earth because, you know, from some of uh for instance like Nick Hud's work, uh there's been work on kind of hypersaline environments and alternative solvents that come from a lot of solute from an aqueous solution that when you concentrate it, you have something that's still liquid that you can do interesting chemistry in. Um the third and there's five here just so you know where I am on this. um is uh, you know, thinking about prebiotic chemistry. I think we think of it as something that happened and then there was life, but I think that it's worth considering it as we I think of these questions as kind of a progress bar for the emergence of life, you know, we go from low complexity to kind of what Dimitar was talking about higher complexity. Um and I think that that might kind of inform some of our thinking about, you know, we're talking about with exoplanets. Uh and then finally the last two are kind of related. Um there's going to obviously be some geochemical constraints on what kind of protobiomolecules emerge and that's going to vary from body to body. Um and this is going to have uh, you know, impacts from a chemical perspective in terms of, you know, what surfaces are presented and what kind of chemistry you can do on those surfaces as well as and this kind of ties into the geochemistry, um, you know, temperature and pressure. I think that there are environments that are close enough to an earthlike environment where the chemistry could be quite similar, you know, like Mars, you're at, you know, a few millibar.

And so this this ability to get it at spatial organization of metabolism within a cell, within tissue, within an organism, I think is is really important and we need to think about the the needs there and then um, you know, I I think it's fascinating that you want subpixel um information there. That is just blows my mind because we can't even get, you know, reasonable dynamic measurements in a single cell sometimes.

And as as we come at this problem, we see a lot of these correlations at the population level that we're not able to confirm at a single cell level reliably.

For example, the the brain tumor case. So for the brain tumor removal, the surgeon will just take take out the just open the skull and take out the brain tumor and they usually will do assess on that scar wall inside the brain to to see if there is any tumor cell left inside the brain. So the traditional or conventional way is to just take a little very little tiny piece out and do the histology image H and E staining to to check if the cell uh are all brain cells and there is no tumor cells left inside. So then we can close the skull and wake up the patient. But usually it takes the conventional method usually takes too long and maybe a few hours. So the the patient will be under anesthesia for a few hours waiting for the results. But now um since SRS allow us to visualize the protein and the lipids very rapidly. for example I I take like five minutes to take the image when you have that piece of tissue and immediately you have the digital H and E like mimic H and E and the pathologist can look at the H and E image in a few minutes and determine if there is tumor cell left or not. So it saves a few hours and the the patient can be wake up very soon um not they they don't need to be under anesthesia for that that long. So it's kind of protecting the brain. Also it's it's a biopsy. It's a it's a diagnostic biopsy um during the clinical clinical period.
