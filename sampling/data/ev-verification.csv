,04:45-08:08,Aaron Engelhart,"So I have just a few bullet points and um honestly this might be helpful or will be helpful for me because I think that um and uh the the way that I think about this I know isn't the way that you think about it. So just getting into it quickly the the few things I had written down is that um you know, this this kind of comes directly from the questions but water, you know, we think of it as so central to life, but like it's worth considering other solvents, you know, like if we're thinking about Titan or methane or other things like that and I think that per Dimitar's comment about um, you know, how is this even relevant to life on earth? I think that the other solvent question could be relevant to life on earth because, you know, from some of uh for instance like Nick Hud's work, uh there's been work on kind of hypersaline environments and alternative solvents that come from a lot of solute from an aqueous solution that when you concentrate it, you have something that's still liquid that you can do interesting chemistry in. Um the third and there's five here just so you know where I am on this. um is uh, you know, thinking about prebiotic chemistry. I think we think of it as something that happened and then there was life, but I think that it's worth considering it as we I think of these questions as kind of a progress bar for the emergence of life, you know, we go from low complexity to kind of what Dimitar was talking about higher complexity. Um and I think that that might kind of inform some of our thinking about, you know, we're talking about with exoplanets. Uh and then finally the last two are kind of related. Um there's going to obviously be some geochemical constraints on what kind of protobiomolecules emerge and that's going to vary from body to body. Um and this is going to have uh, you know, impacts from a chemical perspective in terms of, you know, what surfaces are presented and what kind of chemistry you can do on those surfaces as well as and this kind of ties into the geochemistry, um, you know, temperature and pressure. I think that there are environments that are close enough to an earthlike environment where the chemistry could be quite similar, you know, like Mars, you're at, you know, a few millibar. I think most of the same stuff can be done there, but if you're thinking about a high pressure environment, that can have pretty profound effects on folding of biopolymers and there's been experiments done with that. So those are the few things that came to mind for me.

So could could exoplanet or planetary science people make a list of which parameters are most variable between different planets because that would allow you to say which planet could or could not do a thing. And then the chemists could make which parameters are most effective in changing the way a chemical reaction turns out because you know certain ones you change them in the lab it is not that big of a deal. Other ones you change it, it changes everything and where that overlap is could be, you know, a shorter list where we could focus in the lab.
