And then the chemists could make which parameters are most effective in changing the way a chemical reaction turns out because you know certain ones you change them in the lab it is not that big of a deal. Other ones you change it, it changes everything and where that overlap is could be, you know, a shorter list where we could focus in the lab.

And I think um at least initially we're not going to be so lucky. Um, we're going to have a very, very small number of planets. They're going to have 12 different properties each, their stars are going to have different properties.

So there is something um I was thinking about. Uh, I was doing uh uh super resolution when I was doing super resolution microscope, I always wanted to stabilize the sample so that with a with a long uh long-term imaging for example like 30 minutes, I don't get a great uh sample drift. So one way I was thinking while I was a postdoc is to use the scattering light from the cell. So we take uh we take the scattering light the image using scattering light of the cell at at the beginning of the imaging and after a few minutes we take another one. So by the end like by the end of the imaging we could use those image to align um kind of put to the kind of uh correct the drift. So that's one thing I was thinking about. Uh, but I haven't tapped it. I'm not sure how precisely I can do as my uh uh I claim a 10 nanometer uh uh uh precision. So I'm trying to make sure how I can how precisely I can do that. And uh some thoughts for the first uh question like how can super resolution uh methods can be translated to uh uh organismal applications. Um, I have been thinking about that for the past few years. Um, one thing I found uh uh that could be helpful is maybe lizing the floor for chemistry because right now uh I spend a lot of time on doing uh imaging analysis uh like look at all the localization and how to cluster them and how to figure out the organization of the proteins. But uh at the end of the day I thought if we could use different floor for to map these what I mean is if I put it in a example, see if we have a DNA molecule, they can uh kind of fold into different structure. Like if we wanted to figure out the structure, let's see uh we can use uh maybe the barcoding system like we can since we know the sequence we probably can uh use the barcoding to map the entire sequence, then then we label that the molecule uh ourselves, then we can image that maybe we know we would figure out like uh how they position the spatial. So that's So I think um maybe uh aside from the imaging processing just using AI or deep learning to look at the cluster or organization, maybe uh uh floor for can might be helpful. That was my thought.",

And so I imagine Earth as like a different planet every time you look at it throughout its history because a lot of things have changed. And so I think we have all these ideas of what bio signatures are for Earth today, but we know that life was on Earth for at least three and a half billion years or so. And so from a bio signatures perspective, if you applied all these techniques to Earth, at what point in Earth's history would you detect life for real with each of these techniques and those might all change things like the atmospheric detections of oxygen or the isotopes or the organic molecules in samples. And so it's a lot of times an origin of life there's this idea that once you have the tipping from the prebiotic world to the biotic world it just takes over and spreads rapidly because it's so good at evolution. And so that may or may not be true, but if it is, then even so you'd have this prebiotic or this completely biotic world for some time before things like atmospheric oxygen would even manifest.",

So there are pigment classes as well. Many of the much of the focus has been on bacterial pigments in the surface ocean as being potentially detectable. That's a challenging field but it's certainly a possibility. There would be other things living in the ocean that might be detectable in a pigment sense. Look at chlorophyll on our own planet.
