So, synthetic chemists would like to make those materials and they focus on getting a certain product distributions, but not necessarily the mechanisms or rates. So, I think that there's like a there's a difference in strategy which gives us less information that we can potentially benchmark to. Uh but I think theory can definitely pitch in when it comes to identifying product distributions, the various pathways, uh selectivities and so on. It's just finding the right match in terms of like uh finding this one experimentalist group that is interested in going the whole way, right? Right from synthesizing what you think works to to showing that that is indeed the pathway. So, I I think it's nice that like most fields are moving towards teams of people. Uh but yeah, I think you need a team because each person has their own individual interest as far as experimentalists go and while theorists have the ability to bridge all these gaps, you can't just work with one person at least from what I've seen in my limited experience.",

I don't know if uh anybody of us really understand it. I don't think anybody does, but we can we can make it with the glasses of usefulness, right? So, it's definitely useful. It has been proven to be useful. And it's just a natural thing of um you know, a multi-dimensional analysis especially for structure property relationships. So um you can see it how it works, right? So it's a multi-dimensional thing that it's I don't know, 12, 13 dimensions, but you can reduce it to a component um that it could be understand by understood by a human brain. So, one of the things I I think I I will have to go back to the original um comment that I give, which is the negative results, right? So there was a very beautiful paper recently, well, not recently, three years ago where it was an organic synthesis, but you can train a machine learning model that takes into account the negative results of experiments. So at the end of the day, you were able to predict the the right reaction path and the right conditions that are the most optimal, right? So I think that's where um machine learning could be used because if you ever do any simple models with machine learning, you will learn that the more data, the better, right? So the more data that it's accurate, the better, the more data that it's um you know, uh that you can reproduce it better. So basically any data is good. So I think that it's something missing um that we can exploit both as experimentalists and as a computationally tradition-minded scientist that um we might be discarding um a lot of data that could be useful. Uh one quick example for theory could be, you know, when you do your your simulation of MD, you're trying to wait all these different snapshots that could be so useful. One example for experiments, those negative results um or where where we were seeing is the all these decay, maybe that decay can give you the the next design principle. But you know, those bottom line is um I think uh the current thing in machine learning probably that could be useful is just we need to find ways to get more information, more data that is more accurate and maybe look at places that we thought um you know, they were they were um rubbish, they were waste, but maybe they are useful.",

I find machine learning is very useful to my research because uh I'm doing the so-called AB initial molecular dynamics to study the various electro compasses. And of course, this type of calculation, um we basically need to sample for example, hundreds of thousands structures in order to get one hourly the quantity instead we just using one snapshot uh to tell you the the the uh the property. And in order to sample all this uh numerous structures, if you want to uh calculate all the structures using for example, density functional theory, it will be extremely computationally expensive. So machine learning can help us uh in a way so that we do not need to do explicit uh quantum mechanical calculation for all the structures.

Let me give you one example that we are probing the solid state materials and probing the redox reactions inside solid state materials with three-dimensional spatial resolution. Now, with a particle of 10 micron size, we are collecting 1.5 million excess absorption spectroscopy for metal cations. So every time we do the experiment with over a week, we get back with 8 to 10 terabyte data. So it's at the point that we have to develop our own machine learning or other advanced data analysis methods to analyze data. Unfortunately, we are still very slow on that end. We are still analyzing data that we collected a few years back. Now, speaking of the other high throughput capability that there are a lot of experimental opportunities at different synchrotron facilities where you can collect a thousand high quality absorption spectra just in one day. Again, beamline scientists and myself, we have been talking about how to streamline the data analysis using high throughput mode, but we are still not making progress on that yet.

We, for almost a century now, we've been using transition state theory and assuming that all of these modes are harmonic. And we all implicitly know that there are deficiencies to this. And the thing though is that like more advanced, more accurate rate theories exist. So there's variational theories, there are semi-classical theories, all of them exist, we just don't use them because they are too expensive. So, I think there is definitely room for finding ways in which we can make these more expensive theories more tractable. I think a lot of advances in machine learning, signal processing, all of these can be applied to like quantum chemistry to make all of this happen. And make those more cost effective. And therefore make quantum chemistry predictions of rates more accurate. We generally throw out our rate coefficient predictions because we know that they're quite meaningless. We only compare barriers, we only look at potential energy surfaces. But I think there's room for rate predictions, accurate tunneling contribution calculations and so on. Like all of those sophisticated things which now exist only for model systems can be made more practical with all of the other advances that are going on in algorithm development.",

Machine learning for development, uh, for understanding the, uh, the wave function or machine learning to understanding, you know, a guess of transition state and so that's where method development I have seen, um, going in pretty much every area, you know, MD and and so on. Um, so, I don't know. My my my take on this is that is definitely the the way to go, but also because machine learning is so useful, so tempting, at the same time, we still don't understand the basics of it, right? It works. We just don't know why why it works at the fundamental level. So, my, um, I guess concern would be if all these new models or new, uh, developments or methods work, do we really truly understand everything? Because really machine learning part we don't fully understand it. We we just know it works. So it's just a question of, um, of once these method work and are developed and fully, uh, implemented, the question will be really, do we really understand all these?
