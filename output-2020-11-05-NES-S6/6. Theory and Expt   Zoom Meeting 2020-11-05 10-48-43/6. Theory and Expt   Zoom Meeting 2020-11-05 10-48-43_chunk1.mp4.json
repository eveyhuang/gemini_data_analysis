So, synthetic chemists would like to make those materials and they focus on getting a certain product distributions, but not necessarily the mechanisms or rates. So, I think that there's like a there's a difference in strategy which gives us less information that we can potentially benchmark to. Uh but I think theory can definitely pitch in when it comes to identifying product distributions, the various pathways, uh selectivities and so on. It's just finding the right match in terms of like uh finding this one experimentalist group that is interested in going the whole way, right? Right from synthesizing what you think works to to showing that that is indeed the pathway. So, I I think it's nice that like most fields are moving towards teams of people. Uh but yeah, I think you need a team because each person has their own individual interest as far as experimentalists go and while theorists have the ability to bridge all these gaps, you can't just work with one person at least from what I've seen in my limited experience.",

            "transcript": "Well, this would be um I think it's it's a very interesting topic as you know, it's it's a very hot topic and everybody is probably trying to do it. I don't know if uh anybody of us really understand it. I don't think anybody does, but we can we can make it with the glasses of usefulness, right? So, it's definitely useful. It has been proven to be useful. And it's just a natural thing of um you know, a multi-dimensional analysis especially for structure property relationships. So um you can see it how it works, right? So it's a multi-dimensional thing that it's I don't know, 12, 13 dimensions, but you can reduce it to a component um that it could be understand by understood by a human brain. So, one of the things I I think I I will have to go back to the original um comment that I give, which is the negative results, right? So there was a very beautiful paper recently, well, not recently, three years ago where it was an organic synthesis, but you can train a machine learning model that takes into account the negative results of experiments. So at the end of the day, you were able to predict the the right reaction path and the right conditions that are the most optimal, right? So I think that's where um machine learning could be used because if you ever do any simple models with machine learning, you will learn that the more data, the better, right? So the more data that it's accurate, the better, the more data that it's um you know, uh that you can reproduce it better. So basically any data is good. So I think that it's something missing um that we can exploit both as experimentalists and as a computationally tradition-minded scientist that um we might be discarding um a lot of data that could be useful. Uh one quick example for theory could be, you know, when you do your your simulation of MD, you're trying to wait all these different snapshots that could be so useful. One example for experiments, those negative results um or where where we were seeing is the all these decay, maybe that decay can give you the the next design principle. But you know, those bottom line is um I think uh the current thing in machine learning probably that could be useful is just we need to find ways to get more information, more data that is more accurate and maybe look at places that we thought um you know, they were they were um rubbish, they were waste, but maybe they are useful.",

I find machine learning is very useful to my research because uh I'm doing the so-called AB initial molecular dynamics to study the various electro compasses. And of course, this type of calculation, um we basically need to sample for example, hundreds of thousands structures in order to get one hourly the quantity instead we just using one snapshot uh to tell you the the the uh the property. And in order to sample all this uh numerous structures, if you want to uh calculate all the structures using for example, density functional theory, it will be extremely computationally expensive. So machine learning can help us uh in a way so that we do not need to do explicit uh quantum mechanical calculation for all the structures. We just need to do uh uh calculation for a set for a selected selected set of structures and use the structures to train the machine learning model so then you can predict the of other structures without doing the gateway DFT calculations. So I find this is very helpful and needs to my research.",

So, Jose was talking about machine learning based on experimental data at least to some extent. The amount of experimental data you need to have an actually predictive model is massive. You and UA was talking about machine learning based on um quantum chemistry and the amount of reference data you need there is mass of. And so yes, it can help, but it's also one of those that it only works if you have good reference data for something very similar to what you're trying to predict.",

So those papers are only done in a way uh that's the first study uh limited set of number uh limited number of materials and calculate the properties of those materials and then use the uh use the data set to train the machine learning model and then use this machine learning model uh for other materials uh which then they can predict the properties. So as we need to be very careful because I often found that the the computational methods used to predict the properties are problematic. They are not very accurate to predict the properties. So if you use wrong data, not very high quality data to train your machine learning model, then you will end up with wrong predictions. So I think that's um uh that's an issue we need to be uh we need to pay more attention to in the machine learning field. Yeah.",
