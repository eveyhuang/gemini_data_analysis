            "transcript": "A way to get more accurate temperatures is by using these very approximate rate theories, right? We, for almost a century now, we've been using transition state theory and assuming that all of these modes are harmonic. And we all implicitly know that there are deficiencies to this. And the thing though is that like more advanced, more accurate rate theories exist. So there's variational theories, there are semi-classical theories, all of them exist, we just don't use them because they are too expensive. So, I think there is definitely room for finding ways in which we can make these more expensive theories more tractable. I think a lot of advances in machine learning, signal processing, all of these can be applied to like quantum chemistry to make all of this happen. And make those more cost effective. And therefore make quantum chemistry predictions of rates more accurate. We generally throw out our rate coefficient predictions because we know that they're quite meaningless. We only compare barriers, we only look at potential energy surfaces. But I think there's room for rate predictions, accurate tunneling contribution calculations and so on. Like all of those sophisticated things which now exist only for model systems can be made more practical with all of the other advances that are going on in algorithm development.",

Um, so, yeah, from from computation, I think the the interface is still all the methods that we're still using is, you know, um, electronic structure, uh, MD and to some degree Monte Carlo, but I think the new wave of method development that I see pretty much everywhere is just implementing machine learning for something, right? Machine learning for development, uh, for understanding the, uh, the wave function or machine learning to understanding, you know, a guess of transition state and so that's where method development I have seen, um, going in pretty much every area, you know, MD and and so on. Um, so, I don't know. My my my take on this is that is definitely the the way to go, but also because machine learning is so useful, so tempting, at the same time, we still don't understand the basics of it, right? It works. We just don't know why why it works at the fundamental level. So, my, um, I guess concern would be if all these new models or new, uh, developments or methods work, do we really truly understand everything? Because really machine learning part we don't fully understand it. We we just know it works. So it's just a question of, um, of once these method work and are developed and fully, uh, implemented, the question will be really, do we really understand all these? Because really the machine learning is still not clear there.",

You know, understanding how you would you would do these silica reactions or such to the geochemistry bit and and uh, we hopefully one of the other sections will deal with that, um, in in we've got us one of the discussion sections that will address, um, some of the experimental sort of theory measurement spectrum for for that set of reactions.",
