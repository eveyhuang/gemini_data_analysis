So he never really calculate all these numbers that he uses his theory and he was saying, well, I only took it from the experiments and I put it on my theory and the only trick that he did is, you know, he he just reorganized entire equations that he have, you know, half a page of equation into something that is simple, but it just get parameters from experiments. So the lessons I guess from that one when I when I ask him he said, well, this model work really well, but he never actually calculate anything from, you know, from those organization energies and all these salvation things. So I was wondering, it's extremely useful and is certainly a model system that it's approximate more things. So I don't know if um, you know, we're talking about very um a more accurate simulations with realistic stuff and also very simplistic models that can probably do more accurate and and and efficient. I was wondering because that electron transfer theory, it actually is in the middle ground, right? It's complexity but also a model system. So but it's so successful and explaining many things. So maybe also the two extremes are good, but maybe we can also think in something in the middle just like the lesson we learned from from electron transfer um uh with the Marcus theory.",

Uh one thing that's not covered in the topic is the concentration gradient at the at the surface layer. The electrical double layer is one thing, but that layer is very small. But if you are talking about uh uh the concentration gradient layer uh applying to the equals system that could be the pH gradient at the surface. That can range from uh few nanometers to tens of microns, even 100 microns. There are a lot of things going on in there, the dissolution of the catalyst and different solvation structure of the catalyst and um and the cluster formation in the solution phase and how that cluster will dissolve and re-deposit back to the electro surface. There's a lot of things in that gradient layer that's completely unknown at this point. So, um we have been doing research uh developing uh mostly based on single term techniques to to visualize the specially uh spatial resolution and with temporal resolution as well at that gradient uh layer, what what's going on with the metal ions in that layer. Uh can range from uh protons, hydroxidions and metal ions dissolve from the from the electrodes and uh there's a lot of things who can can be done at that interface to to to modify the surface of the catalyst.",

The way the whole field of development has evolved is that you have this artificial divide between quantum chemist and quantum physicist. Like quantum chemist work on these idealized gas phase systems and physicist work on these continuous systems. So no one bothered to benchmark things to the interface. So I think even the gas solid interface is a challenging thing for us to model, let alone a gas liquid interface. So I think there is some progress in figuring out like what these benchmark systems might be through like these single crystal uh experiments so to speak, which allow for us to at least look at how things bind at that interface and how our theories perform. So I I think electrochemistry electrochemical interfaces is a whole other ball game altogether, although I don't know much about them. Um but yeah, model systems, I think even for a gas solid interface is quite a challenge and any progress in that would be amazing. Um yeah, and the other issue of course is that all of these things are dynamic. So one way around it for defining a model system would be to try and pick out those catalysts that have uniform active sites. So in part of my group gets away with it because we look at molecular catalyst, but when it comes to interfaces, there's there's we have to look at the ensemble. And even if we do look at the ensemble, we still don't know how to get it up to experiments. So we are trying to do dynamics, but then dynamics again, there's so little you can do with initial dynamics. You can't really simulate realistic time scales. So trying to figure out if there are like picosecond time scale experiments that we can actually benchmark the theory and and then take it forward from there might might also be a way forward.",

Uh and uh the reason for that is to sort of use the uh ability of a rigid more or less rigid porphrin to control the local reaction environment around the active site. Um and so by uh changing molecular identities of the pendant groups, you could start to change the local proton uh availability or um uh the sort of stabilization or destabilization of reaction intermediates. Um and I'm also interested in uh in in doing time resolved infrared spectroscopy. So I think I would be certainly really excited to uh try to collaborate with theorists uh on on that and maybe starting even from something really simple like um you know, substrate binding studies that don't even have to progress beyond or or that initially would not progress uh into the realm of catalysis, but could just look at what's the role of the local environment and how can we build models to address that question.",

But something more papers are coming up to especially in the machine learning field where negative means more information means something where you don't want to go. But that's still useful information. So we're biased to a successful results. But I wonder how I mean, I think pretty much every scientist that I have met, how we we depreciate negative results as something that we shouldn't even look at it, right? So, um, I don't know, I just wonder because there's these all these experiments, especially for synthesis that you can tell, you know, what temperature doesn't work or what solvent doesn't work or something. But that if you put these into a model system, let's say a training model or something, you will know that that directions will not be working, but it's still useful information. So I always um, you know, probably in in experiment and also in theory in in the theoretical fields, um, how we depreciate these negative results. It's really truly negative, but we don't appreciate as as useful information.",

But it almost sounds like it was more leaning more towards, um, if we're really trying to get into like a next generation of catalytic systems where you're going to be able to do things like break scaling relations, you're probably going to have to have inherently more complex systems so that you have multiple types of functional active sites that are controlled so that you can basically have cascades of different active sites for different steps in the pathway that are kind of optimized over. Okay? And then you get into the realm of I need to kind of explore systems that have huge parameter spaces, whatever they are, like they're if they're something like high entropy alloys or something where you've just got these poly elemental combinations of elements like organized in a particle or something, can we come up with efficient ways of exploring those systems? That's a place where I think my croscopy could actually be really, really, really powerful because if you make kind of just heterogeneous assemblies of these systems, you can kind of quickly screen through them and identify, you know, what's promising and then, you know, use theory to explain, predict, guide where we're going forward.",
