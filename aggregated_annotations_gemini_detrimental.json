And for sure, in the future they they might work. And so far we haven't seen any very successful probiotic pill design to decolonize CD even for this very uh simple scenario. For very complicated disease like the uh the neuro uh neurological disorders, uh the printers disorders we are talking about in this conference, I don't think there is a kind of one direction collision. It's very likely is bidirectional. So how can we make sure modulating microbiome will indeed uh benefit the host. Um so very likely you have to do the perturbation in a very consistent way and the in terms of probiotics maybe you have to do the uh administration on on a very um um um in a constant way like on a daily basis for example.

It's interesting to hear what your perspective is. All the sessions I've been part of um it's it's always interesting to hear what the group what direction they go with it. Um we hardly ever talked about uh gut brain axis or anything to do that. This was sort of a high level discussion about big data sets and and and how you deal with things. Um certainly one of the things that the I'll just put this out there just so that uh uh it it's in people's minds. It's not necessarily something that uh is right or or better than than what we're doing but uh certainly one of the things that multi omix data sets sort of the hot area that is now are making these tissue atlases for example. So if you look at the enteric nervous system um and you make a multi omic data set there, you can divide it or or the goal is to divide it into what are actually the different tissue types that are there based on some kind of multi omic profile of of individual cells or groups of cells and then how does that what what what anatomical location is that within the GI tract, what what microbes are likely to be in that area. It's very different uh uh at the at the top of the small intestine than it is down at the bottom of the colon. Uh you know, those kind of those kinds of questions about how the gut can communicate with the brain through the enteric nervous system and how you use multi. There's a whole dimension that I don't think we touched on there and um when you're thinking about your your two and three person projects, just remember the goal here is to be bold and you know, try to do something uh highly impactful uh but but manageable, not not completely over the top. And and um I think our discussion was very good but it was kind of high level and and you might think of some of these other kind of methods driven uh approaches to how multi omics is going to uh allow us to understand the connection between the microbiome, whether it's in the gut or any other tissue and the brain. Um oral microbiome is pretty interesting as well because your mouth is much closer to your brain than your gut is and so uh the possibility for communication there is quite different.

Um, for example, so one of my colleagues here at Yale recently had a really nice paper showing this isn't gut brain in this case, but uh but brain uh immune connection where he showed actually that stress can lead to um uh a nervous system mediated activation of adipocytes to release IL6, um an inflammatory cytokine. Um, I think there's also some really interesting, I was talking about this in the last group as well actually. Um, you know, examples of uh even uh conditioning of immune responses, so classical conditioning of immune responses, again suggesting true bidirectional communication because basically uh, you know, what what one of the things that was shown a couple decades ago, um is that you can condition allergic responses. Uh, so if you give a neutral stimulus, ring a bell and give an allergen, ring a bell and give an allergen, ring a bell and give an allergen, eventually you can ring the bell and all the mass cells in the body will degranulate um without the allergen being present. Um, so that really truly does suggest bidirectional because this type this information had to be encoded from the immune cells being the initial responders, um presumably, although could be direct neuronal sensing as well. There's now evidence for that, but at least the model at the time was that it's initially the mass cells that are sensing, talking to the neurons, the neurons talking to the brain, eventually the brain learning that the proper response to this stimulus um is uh is an allergic response and then encoding that as a learned behavior. Um, and becomes almost an anticipatory behavior and you have these kind of anecdotes of people who are the the famous story my PI used to tell was that he had a uh he had a friend who who insisted that she was allergic to the sight of her of her ex-boyfriend. Um, that she would see him and start to, you know, break out in hives.

So I know I personally don't work on energy for catalysis, but I know there are a lot of computational works that are starting from the first principle calculations and then coupling them with AI to really screen a bunch of different transition metal chalcogenides and chalcogenates to see how they interact with hydrogen and oxygen, very simple molecules to um for energy, for hydrogen evolution reaction or you know, basically for catalysis, you know, catalyzing those reactions. And then AI coupled with first principle calculations identify what are the type of defects or what transition metals that can actually be thermodynamic stable to make them and they are good to um for that application. And so then they guide the experimentalist that you know, don't build your material, molydenum disulfide for example with manganese.

And what's also interesting is that they were different. There was very little overlap in terms of of what those changes actually look like. And so I think that's one example um where again, we were able to specifically activate cells in the ENS because we use these AAVs that Viviana develops which only target which don't even go into the brain, right? use specific promoters um to drive them in neurons and then we use either TH creamice or chat creamice so expression in those specific subsets of neurons.

So could you have a redox potential measured in one study, it's probably reasonable to be consistent within a study, but across studies, the numbers that they change by like or like uh orders of magnitude of 10 or 100 um that are um that are dramatic. And one of the things that um I'm interested in if anyone has comments on this is um how can we measure metal ions better in the gut and in real time and this has been a huge challenge in the chemical biology field. Um this is really hard with iron um in in the like in a complex system um where we are is like synchrotron is the only way you can actually measure um iron speciation as far as I know right now um in um biological systems. So it's like doable, but it's not does anybody know how to use one? I don't. I know you can like get time on these, but um it's really complicated.

        "transcript": "So, I've took a bunch of notes in the notepad section, so down at the bottom here. So hopefully there's a lot of everybody's thoughts represented. Um, and sort of distilled these these bigger points. And so in thinking about what the what are the main routes of communication between the gut and the brain. And so I feel like we we sort of delved into the two the two halves of this, the humoral side, the circulation and versus the neuronal and how do we study and differentiate between those paths. And so on the humoral side, thinking about metabolites coming from the gut that can cross the blood brain barrier or via the circumventricular organs. Um, but which factors are those um, whether they're microbes themselves or metabolites, circulating cytokines and how do we actually identify those metabolites. Um, and they could be any like oh should probably change this order, but things such as, you know, exosomes, uh small RNAs, things coming variety of different metabolites coming from from both bacteria or or potentially the host. Um, using methods such as isotopic labeling perhaps. Um, how do we differentiate between protein activity versus small molecule activity. And so really kind of focusing on those methods there. And then also really the the idea that uh which I found interesting uh that tight junction disruption in the gut isn't necessarily going to be the same as tight junction disruption in in the brain. And so just because certain metabolites are getting out doesn't out of the gut doesn't mean that those are going to be the ones that can cross the brain. Um, and then on the neuronal side, I feel like we we mostly focused on the top down aspects of of how CNS to either peripheral nervous system and enteric nervous system or to the microbiome might be affecting microbiome composition. And so I I put this phrase here that anything that alters anything in the CNS that alters motility might have an effect on microbiome composition and I think that's true. Um, you can disagree with me. Um, but then is motility actually the primary thing that changes. And so while that might be the the largest driving factor, there's also these many other effects that um the CNS uh has has impact on to towards the ENS. Um, and then can we use disruptions in those top down systems in order to probe uh those interactions that are happening in the gut. So uh we talked about pain and anxiety and peripheral nerve injury to look at how you know, CNS to to peripheral nervous system signals could change uh microbiome composition. Uh, and then I guess towards the end, uh we were talking a lot about those particular tools and it seems like one of the biggest gaps, which I'm kind of surprised it sounds exists is this fact that we haven't yet leveraged all of those great tools for the CNS to look at ENS interactions. Um, so using the the very specific um adnoviral vectors and and these different optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches that have been well established and validated in in CNS systems just that that it seems to be a gap in in the enteric nervous system itself. And so using those tools to guide or or to to learn more about those interactions. And then towards the end here in my last 60 seconds, uh you know, how given the number of bacterial species, how do we how do we actually define which bacteria we want to look at. And do we limit to just metabolites? And so if there's anything I'm missing, please please holler. Or edit this yourself.",

        "transcript": "this is a maybe slightly off topic and I promise I'll connect it back. So give me give me one moment of indulgence. A classic problem in neuroscience has been to look at like for example a neuron deep in the visual cortex, like an area of V4 and figure out what it is about the visual scene that makes the neuron spike. And basically forever neuroscientists were hindered by the fact that you can only get a limited number of observational data of like when that neuron spikes paired with the images that were presented to the animal. And there's a a huge um universe of different visual features that it could have been and there's a lot of non linearities between them. And it was basically impossible. Really recently like the past couple years work from my lab and others solved that. And what we did is we just trained deep neural nets to take an images and predict when the neuron's going to spike. So you take the the data of the image and the spikes, uh train your neural net to to predict when the neuron's going to spike. And then once you do that, we can invert that process. So we can synthesize a bunch of images that are predicted to drive high firing rates in the neuron. That tells us what the neuron uh responds to and of course if you then you can validate that by showing those images to the animal and verifying that you do get the predicted firing rates out. So I wonder if if a sort of data driven scheme like that of, you know, taking microbiome observations, predicting uh disease states or pathologies and then inverting those predictors might also help in this case uh similar to the way it does in in um neuroscience. That's more an approach than a organ systems comment, but",

Um but at least you can do this with human tissues as well. And getting back to the previous question, um human versus mouse. I mean, obviously everything is context dependent as pros and cons, but I think one of the the major values of the in vitro systems are that you can use fully human systems, right? You know, if I wanted to do something in humans, you know, it's much easier for me to do you know, let's say if it's novel so it's unethical or not feasible to to actually dose a person with a molecule.

Like what would be the kind of the benchmark unit? I don't know what uh whatever scale it is some middle scale. And I think we talked about if I'm answering your question correctly, maybe a single cell analysis from gut tissue, right? Um you know, unless you have again, unless it's a very well worked out system where you know that this side of kind produced by this bacteriphage, you know, uh is the effect is meeting the effect that you're interested in. If it's, you know, novel discovery, I think you just start with single cell or other other single cell sequencing or other cell technologies, right? And then see to what degree you can reproduce those in vivo results in the culture system. But it's probably not it's certainly not perfect. Um but at least you can do this with human tissues as well. And getting back to the previous question, um human versus mouse. I mean, obviously everything is context dependent as pros and cons, but I think one of the the major values of the in vitro systems are that you can use fully human systems, right? You know, if I wanted to do something in humans, you know, it's much easier for me to do you know, let's say if it's novel so it's unethical or not feasible to to actually dose a person with a molecule. Um, I might want to start with an in vitro system that's fully human, right? Because I can always argue I I I can do the mouse system.

And so just understanding the communication when cells are together seems like a more tangible approach than trying to understand what all these cells are doing, you know, not just distally but but you know, in terms of long distances, right?

So using genetic data, there's a possibility to test the possible causal relationship between one microbial biomarker and the the disease. And you you think about it uh a bold suggestion is that we have many possible microbial micro uh biomarkers. We can use that same approach and then screen through them to find the metabolite that are likely to be causal for a specific disease. Right? Try to prioritize biomarkers for disease. And that's what we do recently in the lab for COVID-19. We go across a few thousand traits including biomarkers and identify the ones that are likely to be causal increasing people's risk for severe COVID-19. And I feel that we can apply the same approach to prioritize possible causal biomarker for a specific disease. And then we can flip that idea around. If you have a specific biomarker like bute, what kind of disease is is bute relevant with? We start with bute, we can screen through any possible disease and prioritize the one that is likely has a causal relationship with uh bute. Okay?

And so you if you introduce a probiotic, for example, that will go to the gut, but will not graft and not change the environment, nothing really happened, right? But if you somehow manage to change that environment, the microbiota will change. Um, and so, um, I'll I'll give you two examples from my research. One, we did a study where we look at um, the gut microbiota after gastric bypass surgery.

Uh if you want to understand at the metabolite level, we need to know the molecular structures and the lipid types of a bacterial cell membrane, uh, you know, the the porins that are in the bacterial membrane which have the the selective transport of the metabolites in and out of a cell, you know, what are you feeding a cell, what will be coming out of the cell, all those things are important and computational modeling is getting to the point that we have several species like pseudomonas, uh, pylori and other things, not all of them. Uh, but they are there now. So my lab has developed 10 different bacterial species models right to the molecular level detail. Similarly, on the uh mammalian side, uh, what is the gut epithelial membrane look like? What is the composition of the lipids? Uh, what is the cell cell junctions in the gut, tight junctions and such. Those uh structures are now getting available. So now it's a matter of time to find the experimental collaborator who's looking at those specific questions and which species to put together and what are the metabolites you would like to model. Uh, because there has to be some evidence coming from the experimental groups that these are the two species that do that do coexist or this is the main metabolite that is responsible for the communication and then we can model and give the mechanistic insight or the kinetic aspect of it and those things. So, you know, computational science is only I I just like to say that it's not more than 30 years old when everybody started doing, okay, we have the model. So we are like behind in catching up to the complexity in an experiment, but it's getting there. Um, and I'm happy to say that within uh within maybe next 10 years, we will have, you know, all these data sets available for multi species interactions. But if we start small, given that this question is very new and that's what the log is all about. Uh, I think if we start with that uh basic level that you know, these are maybe say two species of bacteria that are important. Um, and we go down to the atomistic molecular level details of the interactions, I think with a good collaboration, we can start making a difference. And then uh I was speaking to my group yesterday that ultimately it's a big data problem. When you have multiple species with multiple metabolites, uh, and they evolve in time, what we really need to do is have like a map of what are the communication lines between the bacterial species. And that is a big data problem and we need to build that database. We need to uh be able to make that network with somebody was saying that it may be not it's not a linear interaction between two things. There could be many things going back and forth. We need to build that network map and just like, you know, um big data is being used, artificial intelligence is being used to predict that if these are the two species in play, these will be the metabolites. We can get to that point. Uh, it needs to again be built up. So the short answer to your question is yes, but work needs to go on.",

A classic problem in neuroscience has been to look at like for example a neuron deep in the visual cortex, like an area of V4 and figure out what it is about the visual scene that makes the neuron spike. And basically forever neuroscientists were hindered by the fact that you can only get a limited number of observational data of like when that neuron spikes paired with the images that were presented to the animal. And there's a a huge um universe of different visual features that it could have been and there's a lot of non linearities between them. And it was basically impossible. Really recently like the past couple years work from my lab and others solved that. And what we did is we just trained deep neural nets to take an images and predict when the neuron's going to spike. So you take the the data of the image and the spikes, uh train your neural net to to predict when the neuron's going to spike. And then once you do that, we can invert that process. So we can synthesize a bunch of images that are predicted to drive high firing rates in the neuron. That tells us what the neuron uh responds to and of course if you then you can validate that by showing those images to the animal and verifying that you do get the predicted firing rates out. So I wonder if if a sort of data driven scheme like that of, you know, taking microbiome observations, predicting uh disease states or pathologies and then inverting those predictors might also help in this case uh similar to the way it does in in um neuroscience.

So the um the interesting thing about um the innervation of the gut is that that it's there there's multiple different kinds of of systems that are there, the inter nervous system, the vagus system and also uh just sensory neurons from the DRGs. But um they all have similar uh functionality in the context of the types of receptors they express and for for a while the idea that there is these this atypical expression pattern of of of um things like kind receptors and other receptors that actually physically and directly bind to microbes themselves um to facilitate um to facilitate an output or physiology is is is a fairly new concept like maybe within the past five to six years. And so uh when you talk about neuroinflammation, I know we've been talking a lot about the brain but really in the context in the periphery and locally at the site within the gut, there's quite a bit of neuroinflammation and control. And so these what they what they do, right is um they express and also and the and the purpose for for those are to recruit uh immune cells to a particular site to help uh mediate if something's out of you know if there's too many microbes of one kind or another. Um, so the the neurons sense what's happening and and bring more immune cells to the site and thereby directly mediating neuroinflammation. Um, kind of like a conductor, right? And then uh the the idea of of um how that's what what the signal actually is, what's the or the micro bind to to the a neuron, um they have a representation or electrophysiological representation or activity. Um, something called uh like a neurogram if you will like for a particular or particular microbe, which is one of my ideas actually for a project is are there different um activation signatures um in the Vegas for particular microbes that can give you an idea of what's happening and how the brain is affected downstream and this is in the context of whatever disease state you want to think about PD, AD.

And so they designed this study to identify whether intestinal permeability was a predisposing factor to IBD uh in and so there was all these anecdotal evidences that um people had permeability defects prior to getting IBD and this was a designed specifically to address this and so they had um siblings uh of IBD patients and they looked at stool, they looked at biopsies and all these things and were able to identify permeability as a as a precursor to IBD in a genetically susceptible population. Um and I know that they collected all the stool and they haven't analyzed it yet, but that might be one way to look at biomarkers um for people that over time developed IBD. And so I'm not sure if a similar study could be designed with a specific neurodegenerative disease in mind where there is an genetic or environmental component that can be identified prior to onset. And then following although some of these the the process is a lot longer because the disease develops later in life compared to IBD, but it's just an example of something that was could be designed in order to get biomarkers prior to and then during.

        "transcript": "Single cause at the beginning, everything else is correlated. And I I want to propose one idea uh from human genetics. And right now the method is claimed to be able to infer causal relationship. And the idea is that uh for example, if you LDL cholesterol is positively correlated with heart disease and a lot of studies find that, but it could be confounded by many factors. Imagine that there's a genetic variant that can increase LDL and it's it's a causal variant, we know that. Some individual will carry that variant. Some individual will carry the reference allele. It's like a randomized trial, assign the treatment placebo randomly to different individuals. You follow them for a lifetime, and then you see for those that carry the variant, they have they have higher LDL by definition. Do they tend to have higher risk of heart disease? And putting that kind of information together can help us infer if LDL is causal for heart disease. And this has been published. And also HDL, the good cholesterol, using the same method has been shown that it is not causally uh leading to heart disease. Genetic variant increase HDL do not associate with lower risk of heart disease. So that is is is a method called Mendelian randomization. And very recently in 2019, there's a nature genetic paper that study the causal relationship of uh microbiome uh short chain and then a metabolic trait, type two diabetes. They study the effect of uh butyrate on obesity and type two diabetes using that approach. And if you guys accept that approach, then we can leverage a lot of the existing data set. You only need a G for a metabolite. And then you need G for the outcome, for the disease. Putting those information together in a statistical network can help you infer if that metabolite is causal for the outcome. Uh and we have a lot of data out there for metabolite. We have less data for microbiome because G for microbiome mostly is small data set, so it's not that reliable. But if we look at butyrate, acetate, we we have large G for them. For example, in UK Biobank, they have 200,000 participants with those uh biomarker. So I think there's a lot of opportunity using that method if you believe that it is causal. But I I I personally feel that at least it's one step forward towards causal, better than correlation. That's that's my idea.",

I I I don't I'm very ignorant about how brain imaging works, but I know people have started, you know, some of the recent Alzheimer's papers that I've just, you know, just reading just out of pure interest.

Um, and then finally, this conversation about metal ions, there's a lot that sort of was happening while I was trying to get these notes um together, but it sounded like ultimately really there are indications that the microbiota has something to do with uh heavy metal metabolism. There's a lot that we don't understand and technically we don't we don't understand it because there are so many technical challenges just in terms of measurement, reporting across studies and one thing that could really advance the field here would be sensors for metal content and species uh in vivo in real time.

Um, and so I I think I guess to start on kind of the last question, to me one of the challenges of the organizations of the structures is to have compartmentalization in a way where you don't have signals from you know, the meta organism side of things that you don't have control over genomically evolutionarily, um, messing with your own evolution of of uh of tissue structures or cellular communication within the host.

I'm not an ecologist, but for sure, it is only when I read the work from ecologists and what they have done in other ecosystems that I try to draw from some of our questions and and some of our approaches to to understand the early ecology of of the microbiome. The the modulation of the microbiome would be what they would refer to as as um restoration of ecosystems or restoration biology. So there's a few approaches that have been used when, you know, a lake needs to be restored to recover a population of algae, for example. So there's a lot that can be learned and I believe that right now, um the field is not there yet or at least I don't see that very often. We are, I think, learning what are the microbiome changes associated with some patterns of neurological disease. Some of these regarding the early microglia biology seem to me really to be really important. Um and we could start there. We could start focusing on which are the microbes that seem to be triggering or maybe the absence of which microbes seems to be triggering some of these. But but at the end, we need to study microbiomes with microbiomes. The mouse, I don't think, I mean it'll be of course important for proof of concept work, um but at the end, this to me needs to be studied in the human. We study both humans and um mouse mice where I think the the where we want to go, but we're not there yet at least is to try to model these ecosystems in in advanced in vitro systems that can that can hold at least simplified microbiomes, whether they are in in gut organoids or in on organoids on a chip in a system that would allow mimic the the true microbes that that reside in in the human and then study them within the framework of ecology and if we want to change it within the framework of of restoration ecology.",

And right now the method is claimed to be able to infer causal relationship. And the idea is that uh for example, if you LDL cholesterol is positively correlated with heart disease and a lot of studies find that, but it could be confounded by many factors. Imagine that there's a genetic variant that can increase LDL and it's it's a causal variant, we know that. Some individual will carry that variant. Some individual will carry the reference allele. It's like a randomized trial, assign the treatment placebo randomly to different individuals. You follow them for a lifetime, and then you see for those that carry the variant, they have they have higher LDL by definition. Do they tend to have higher risk of heart disease? And putting that kind of information together can help us infer if LDL is causal for heart disease. And this has been published. And also HDL, the good cholesterol, using the same method has been shown that it is not causally uh leading to heart disease. Genetic variant increase HDL do not associate with lower risk of heart disease. So that is is is a method called Mendelian randomization. And very recently in 2019, there's a nature genetic paper that study the causal relationship of uh microbiome uh short chain and then a metabolic trait, type two diabetes. They study the effect of uh butyrate on obesity and type two diabetes using that approach. And if you guys accept that approach, then we can leverage a lot of the existing data set. You only need a G for a metabolite. And then you need G for the outcome, for the disease. Putting those information together in a statistical network can help you infer if that metabolite is causal for the outcome. Uh and we have a lot of data out there for metabolite. We have less data for microbiome because G for microbiome mostly is small data set, so it's not that reliable. But if we look at butyrate, acetate, we we have large G for them. For example, in UK Biobank, they have 200,000 participants with those uh biomarker. So I think there's a lot of opportunity using that method if you believe that it is causal. But I I I personally feel that at least it's one step forward towards causal, better than correlation. That's that's my idea.",

And I think, I mean that's what like the basic science mind thinks about. I mean that's I guess what I used to do in grad school, right? You like break something down and then try to understand it. Now, as a clinician, I think and some of the other um people, I'm sorry, I can't see your names right away, but um we're just talking about, you know, talking from the sort of top like top down. So you take the whole person and what can you detect in the whole person that gives you a biomarker. And I've been thinking about this a lot in autism because I've been doing some neuroimaging work trying to find like a neuroimaging biomarker in autism. I mean first of all, autism is not one thing. I think there's in 10 years we're going to know there's like 15 things we used to call autism and there's genetic autism, there's idiopathic autism, there's blah blah blah, right? But anyways, so you take this top down approach and to me a biomarker is not necessarily one thing, it's a collection of things that's almost like a fingerprint, you know, like the biomarker is a signature that's not that's not one thing you do a lab test for.",

Like you use that genetic variant, you treat the metabolite and then you see if there's an impact on the disease. So using genetic data, there's a possibility to test the possible causal relationship between one microbial biomarker and the the disease. And you you think about it uh a bold suggestion is that we have many possible microbial micro uh biomarkers. We can use that same approach and then screen through them to find the metabolite that are likely to be causal for a specific disease. Right? Try to prioritize biomarkers for disease. And that's what we do recently in the lab for COVID-19. We go across a few thousand traits including biomarkers and identify the ones that are likely to be causal increasing people's risk for severe COVID-19. And I feel that we can apply the same approach to prioritize possible causal biomarker for a specific disease. And then we can flip that idea around. If you have a specific biomarker like bute, what kind of disease is is bute relevant with?

Um and we increased diversity of course because we added a lot of new microbes. Uh but there's a few things that we that we that we showed. Uh still a lot that needs to be learned of course. One of them is that the uh these kids all had gastrointestinal problems and the gastrointestinal problems got better. Most of the kids showed a lot of improvement in behavior too. Um and the behavior improvements remained. We did a follow up two years later and these kids were their behavior was even better in the in the than when we did the treatment. But importantly, when we finished the treatment, we look at how similar was their microbiota to the donor. And when we finished the treatment, the microbiota of these children was more similar to the donor than to another child, okay, that kind of makes sense. We had some engraftment. But two years later, diversity was much higher, but they did not look like the donor at all. They had lost that, you know, similarity to the donor. They had now their new microbiota. Um that some of it some of it probably they just acquire of course from food and from the environment etc. Huge diversity, diversity is higher, but now the question is like, you know, why and how and how is this, you know, affecting the behavior and um if you ask me, we changed the microbiota and we changed the the the microbiota didn't go to the previous state, which was a very dysbiotic one, but I wouldn't say that it was a state a change that remained. Like we we do have this homeostasis in our body that takes it back to a certain state. And so these are some of the questions. I I actually think some of it comes from the biofilm we form when we're infants. Um that sets, you know, sets the sets the the road for future microbiome.

So it was temporary for an acute stress and it was more permanent with the chronic stress. Um and things like corticosterone increase rapidly with the stressor and then they kind of flat line. So if you're going to do chronic stress, you'll still get activation but it's much lower and then that's associated with immune responses, um inflammation, damage, all those things. So there's and then that is associated with a dysbiosis. So acute responses to stress or anxiety are not associated with immuno immune activation and and microbiome changes. Those are more chronic.

So it's uh bit of, you know, preaching to the choir to to get my very biased view on why I think studying interspecies interactions is important because this is at the core of what we do. Um, my take which I alluded to in in yesterday's um session was that we're studying ecosystems and in general the core of ecology is the study of interspecies interactions because I'm focused in in um early life microbombs, this is um an opportunity to study the the process of succession. What happens when an ecosystem is is birthing and and the steps that follow. And importantly, what happens during those events that characterize in this case primary succession that can perturb that ecosystem. And we understand that ecosystem perturbance is associated with many other pathologies that we write grounds on, right? And and and that's at the core. How does this ecosystem can either prevent um that perturbance or what inherent characteristics in the ecosystem can can prevent um the the reaction to the perturbance can increase resilience to a perturbance. Um and in our case also very importantly, if we can through through very, you know, carefully serving the the succession events and all this initial process, if we can predict what features, whether they're um actual species, whether they're metabolites or genes that can that can um be that can mark the the trajectory of whether the ecosystem is going to set in what we still don't understand but what we perceive as a as a healthy initial ecosystem versus a different one. So I I do think that that studying this is is is critically important uh and that it requires at least from my point of view doing it in a in a simpler than a more complex system and and I think microbiologists have been doing that to some degree for for a number of decades now and there's some systems where where we can try and grow the species that we know now grow in this case in a young baby or in in a disease state um during a perturbance and and study the way they are communicating and how that ecosystem develops. One of the concepts that we're learning from um is and and I'm I'm not an ecologist by training. I just now work with them as I understand how important is their their take on this is the concept of um keystone species or in um ecosystem engineers. Sometimes they can a species can be both or it can be one or the other. But these are species that in the case of the gut microbomb would have really good adaptations to live in that niche and also have the the properties to to to um more efficiently um um communicate with other species and and and and grow this ecosystem into a um a more resilient one and a more functionally diverse ecosystem that as well that we at least at this point hypothesize is associated with health versus not.

What happens when an ecosystem is is birthing and and the steps that follow. And importantly, what happens during those events that characterize in this case primary succession that can perturb that ecosystem. And we understand that ecosystem perturbance is associated with many other pathologies that we write grounds on, right? And and and that's at the core. How does this ecosystem can either prevent um that perturbance or what inherent characteristics in the ecosystem can can prevent um the the reaction to the perturbance can increase resilience to a perturbance. Um and in our case also very importantly, if we can through through very, you know, carefully serving the the succession events and all this initial process, if we can predict what features, whether they're um actual species, whether they're metabolites or genes that can that can um be that can mark the the trajectory of whether the ecosystem is going to set in what we still don't understand but what we perceive as a as a healthy initial ecosystem versus a different one. So I I do think that that studying this is is is critically important uh and that it requires at least from my point of view doing it in a in a simpler than a more complex system and and I think microbiologists have been doing that to some degree for for a number of decades now and there's some systems where where we can try and grow the species that we know now grow in this case in a young baby or in in a disease state um during a perturbance and and study the way they are communicating and how that ecosystem develops. One of the concepts that we're learning from um is and and I'm I'm not an ecologist by training. I just now work with them as I understand how important is their their take on this is the concept of um keystone species or in um ecosystem engineers. Sometimes they can a species can be both or it can be one or the other. But these are species that in the case of the gut microbomb would have really good adaptations to live in that niche and also have the the properties to to to um more efficiently um um communicate with other species and and and and grow this ecosystem into a um a more resilient one and a more functionally diverse ecosystem that as well that we at least at this point hypothesize is associated with health versus not.

It's small intestinal tough tough cells that respond to succinate. And that actually makes sense. So the organization of the system is such that we've evolved to avoid sensing the microbial succinate and segregated the expression of the receptor to sense it away from the bacteria. And I think actually that's mostly the design principle is for us to try to design in the majority of cases uh systems where we're not being manipulated by these constant signals or noise. Um the same goes for actually this is a subject I've been fascinated by for a while is that, you know, we secrete tons and tons and tons of um monoamine oxidase into the lumen of the gut. Um mostly this isn't really taught, but actually in the gut lumen there's tons and tons and tons of monoamine oxidase. Um which presumably is there to basically degrade all of these signals before they even get to us. Um of course on the flip side there are going to be those instances that we've evolved to sense things to either to monitor the structure or function of the microbial community or the integrity of the barrier. But I think actually those are the exceptions to the rule. The rule is that we try to not have this these things muck with our gears.

We know that tons of bacteria make succinate. But actually colonic tough tough cells don't respond to succinate. It's small intestinal tough tough cells that respond to succinate. And that actually makes sense. So the organization of the system is such that we've evolved to avoid sensing the microbial succinate and segregated the expression of the receptor to sense it away from the bacteria. And I think actually that's mostly the design principle is for us to try to design in the majority of cases uh systems where we're not being manipulated by these constant signals or noise. Um the same goes for actually this is a subject I've been fascinated by for a while is that, you know, we secrete tons and tons and tons of um monoamine oxidase into the lumen of the gut. Um mostly this isn't really taught, but actually in the gut lumen there's tons and tons and tons of monoamine oxidase. Um which presumably is there to basically degrade all of these signals before they even get to us. Um of course on the flip side there are going to be those instances that we've evolved to sense things to either to monitor the structure or function of the microbial community or the integrity of the barrier. But I think actually those are the exceptions to the rule. The rule is that we try to not have this these things muck with our gears. Um and then choose a small subset of them to actually monitor and respond to that's kind of our our the sentinel signal.\"",

Uh, so given that the short chain fatty acids we talk we heard Bob tell us about and also the serotonins and the hormones that we just are talking about, we can study how they enter the epithelial cells or how they are secreted uh across and how they transport across the membranes or through the epithelial layers which will contribute to the communication part of this question. Uh, how does the communication happen? But is are the molecules small enough or the metabolites small enough to just penetrate through the cell membrane versus the receptors. And question is that, you know, if you knock off the receptors, does the communication still happen? So identifying part of it is not my expertise, but if given the data that these are the metabolites that are found, uh, we can talk about the communication part of it because there is enough uh details available now about the epithilia of the gut uh and also the bacterial membrane itself and the bacterial porins that really transport the metabolite in and out of the material cell also. So sort of you know the walls of the two uh, you know, the the epithelial cells and the bacterial cells and the the if you know the metabolites then the communication piece of it, how that is happening can be model at a molecular level at the atomistic level. And that can provide a lot of information. The other piece that is now growing that if we have a body of data that given these are the microbial species in a in the gut and the associated metabolites, there is uh this whole uh new computational tool of big data where we can start putting together that, you know, what is the correlation between having a list of bacteria and having the metabolites and what is that correlation?

And so whether we're talking about kind of cell to cell contacts, interactions versus kind of diffusion based um, you know, uh interactions versus, you know, something uh host host um uh host microbe interactions. And so I I think those those uh it's it it gets quite complicated and and to some extent, I think most of these interactions are poorly described because at least I'm somewhat biased because we don't have a good understanding of of the spatial architecture in these communities. And so for the most part, all of the genomic technology is focused on getting compositional information and so you have very little actual spatial biogeography down at the resolution of microns that really reflect kind of the underlying kind of the the properties and the organization. Um, to to some extent, these are continuous, you know, communities. It's not necessarily like patches. And so the question is, you know, what are the functional associations that exist between this, you know, physically continuous spectrum, um, you know, in in the oral cavity, for example, there's much more layer structure, um, but in the gut, uh at least, you know, it seems like there's potentially more heterogeneity, but it's not, you know, so it's not just like uh, you know, a a a map uh with distinct kind of regions necessarily. Um, and so then many of these interactions might actually be statistical interactions, right? rather than purely, you know, oh A is next to B and so therefore they interact. It's more like, you know, on average A interacts more with B and so having that, you know, uh description built into whatever framework to reconstruct the metabolism, I think is is important. At least that's something we try to start to appreciate more. Uh because I think every time we we think about space, somehow we we see distinct boundaries and that's really not the case in in in in microbial communities.

And I think that actually makes the problem harder and maybe even further pens you into a space where really the good mark biomarkers and this would be my own bias would be things that may be causal. Um and those would be the things that you would be able to detect actually early before you have the changes in physiology and a lot of the biomarkers that we use that people rely on are the opposite, right?

So those are the interactions we're looking at.

        "transcript": "So, I've took a bunch of notes in the notepad section, so down at the bottom here. So hopefully there's a lot of everybody's thoughts represented. Um, and sort of distilled these these bigger points. And so in thinking about what the what are the main routes of communication between the gut and the brain. And so I feel like we we sort of delved into the two the two halves of this, the humoral side, the circulation and versus the neuronal and how do we study and differentiate between those paths. And so on the humoral side, thinking about metabolites coming from the gut that can cross the blood brain barrier or via the circumventricular organs. Um, but which factors are those um, whether they're microbes themselves or metabolites, circulating cytokines and how do we actually identify those metabolites. Um, and they could be any like oh should probably change this order, but things such as, you know, exosomes, uh small RNAs, things coming variety of different metabolites coming from from both bacteria or or potentially the host. Um, using methods such as isotopic labeling perhaps. Um, how do we differentiate between protein activity versus small molecule activity. And so really kind of focusing on those methods there. And then also really the the idea that uh which I found interesting uh that tight junction disruption in the gut isn't necessarily going to be the same as tight junction disruption in in the brain. And so just because certain metabolites are getting out doesn't out of the gut doesn't mean that those are going to be the ones that can cross the brain. Um, and then on the neuronal side, I feel like we we mostly focused on the top down aspects of of how CNS to either peripheral nervous system and enteric nervous system or to the microbiome might be affecting microbiome composition. And so I I put this phrase here that anything that alters anything in the CNS that alters motility might have an effect on microbiome composition and I think that's true. Um, you can disagree with me. Um, but then is motility actually the primary thing that changes. And so while that might be the the largest driving factor, there's also these many other effects that um the CNS uh has has impact on to towards the ENS. Um, and then can we use disruptions in those top down systems in order to probe uh those interactions that are happening in the gut. So uh we talked about pain and anxiety and peripheral nerve injury to look at how you know, CNS to to peripheral nervous system signals could change uh microbiome composition. Uh, and then I guess towards the end, uh we were talking a lot about those particular tools and it seems like one of the biggest gaps, which I'm kind of surprised it sounds exists is this fact that we haven't yet leveraged all of those great tools for the CNS to look at ENS interactions. Um, so using the the very specific um adnoviral vectors and and these different optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches that have been well established and validated in in CNS systems just that that it seems to be a gap in in the enteric nervous system itself. And so using those tools to guide or or to to learn more about those interactions. And then towards the end here in my last 60 seconds, uh you know, how given the number of bacterial species, how do we how do we actually define which bacteria we want to look at. And do we limit to just metabolites? And so if there's anything I'm missing, please please holler. Or edit this yourself.",

A classic problem in neuroscience has been to look at like for example a neuron deep in the visual cortex, like an area of V4 and figure out what it is about the visual scene that makes the neuron spike. And basically forever neuroscientists were hindered by the fact that you can only get a limited number of observational data of like when that neuron spikes paired with the images that were presented to the animal. And there's a a huge um universe of different visual features that it could have been and there's a lot of non linearities between them. And it was basically impossible. Really recently like the past couple years work from my lab and others solved that. And what we did is we just trained deep neural nets to take an images and predict when the neuron's going to spike. So you take the the data of the image and the spikes, uh train your neural net to to predict when the neuron's going to spike. And then once you do that, we can invert that process. So we can synthesize a bunch of images that are predicted to drive high firing rates in the neuron. That tells us what the neuron uh responds to and of course if you then you can validate that by showing those images to the animal and verifying that you do get the predicted firing rates out. So I wonder if if a sort of data driven scheme like that of, you know, taking microbiome observations, predicting uh disease states or pathologies and then inverting those predictors might also help in this case uh similar to the way it does in in um neuroscience.

And for sure, in the future they they might work. And so far we haven't seen any very successful probiotic pill design to decolonize CD even for this very uh simple scenario. For very complicated disease like the uh the neuro uh neurological disorders, uh the printers disorders we are talking about in this conference, I don't think there is a kind of one direction collision. It's very likely is bidirectional. So how can we make sure modulating microbiome will indeed uh benefit the host. Um so very likely you have to do the perturbation in a very consistent way and the in terms of probiotics maybe you have to do the uh administration on on a very um um um in a constant way like on a daily basis for example.

Um, for example, so one of my colleagues here at Yale recently had a really nice paper showing this isn't gut brain in this case, but uh but brain uh immune connection where he showed actually that stress can lead to um uh a nervous system mediated activation of adipocytes to release IL6, um an inflammatory cytokine. Um, I think there's also some really interesting, I was talking about this in the last group as well actually. Um, you know, examples of uh even uh conditioning of immune responses, so classical conditioning of immune responses, again suggesting true bidirectional communication because basically uh, you know, what what one of the things that was shown a couple decades ago, um is that you can condition allergic responses. Uh, so if you give a neutral stimulus, ring a bell and give an allergen, ring a bell and give an allergen, ring a bell and give an allergen, eventually you can ring the bell and all the mass cells in the body will degranulate um without the allergen being present. Um, so that really truly does suggest bidirectional because this type this information had to be encoded from the immune cells being the initial responders, um presumably, although could be direct neuronal sensing as well. There's now evidence for that, but at least the model at the time was that it's initially the mass cells that are sensing, talking to the neurons, the neurons talking to the brain, eventually the brain learning that the proper response to this stimulus um is uh is an allergic response and then encoding that as a learned behavior. Um, and becomes almost an anticipatory behavior and you have these kind of anecdotes of people who are the the famous story my PI used to tell was that he had a uh he had a friend who who insisted that she was allergic to the sight of her of her ex-boyfriend. Um, that she would see him and start to, you know, break out in hives.

I I think one thing one other maybe related somewhat to at least what what um Judith is alluding to um of you know, again bioavailability, controlling bioavailability. I think it's important to remember that most of these things are actually absorbed via active transport um via channels. It's not that they're just magically going across the barrier and so um small intestinal versus large intestinal organization is also really critical because many more chemicals will actually be absorbed um in the small intestine and so the you know, you can imagine scenarios where if you have aberrant expansion of taxa in the small intestine that are making chemicals bioactive compounds that that may have very different effects than that than they would have if they had stayed in the colon where that that chemical just isn't transported or absorbed at all. Um so I think it's a really important point that we need to always keep in mind that all plays into this question of, you know, the key million dollar question of are these things actually make it to the making it to the places where we think they might be biologically relevant at concentrations that are sufficient to engage whatever host systems.

Um, and so I I think I guess to start on kind of the last question, to me one of the challenges of the organizations of the structures is to have compartmentalization in a way where you don't have signals from you know, the meta organism side of things that you don't have control over genomically evolutionarily, um, messing with your own evolution of of uh of tissue structures or cellular communication within the host.

You know, you can't let it sit around for two weeks before you do the measurements has to be done uh as soon as possible.

Um, you know, there've been a lot of studies by um in the Deneden cohort where these children who have stressful events, they have accelerated aging. Um, so something is perturbing the microbiome when they're young and then you sort of need to get stuck there. So I guess the question is how do you change that once you're stuck in this maybe pro-inflammatory um, you know, environment to make it healthier. And you know, I'm interested in the idea of exogenously maybe giving different bacteria that, you know, produce a lot of maybe like a butyrate or some other short chain fatty acid or an indol or something like that. But I don't know that we even know enough which ones to do. It's probably going to take a lot of animal studies to do that. Most interested in the idea of a fage to maybe knock out a bacteria that is bad, but again, I don't think we know enough about what's a good microbiome and a bad microbiome. So how do we even start?

And I think, I mean that's what like the basic science mind thinks about. I mean that's I guess what I used to do in grad school, right? You like break something down and then try to understand it. Now, as a clinician, I think and some of the other um people, I'm sorry, I can't see your names right away, but um we're just talking about, you know, talking from the sort of top like top down. So you take the whole person and what can you detect in the whole person that gives you a biomarker. And I've been thinking about this a lot in autism because I've been doing some neuro imaging work trying to find like a neuro imaging biomarker in autism. I mean first of all, autism is not one thing. I think there's in 10 years we're going to know there's like 15 things we used to call autism and there's genetic autism, there's idiopathic autism, there's blah blah blah, right? But anyways, so you take this top down approach and to me a biomarker is not necessarily one thing, it's a collection of things that's almost like a fingerprint, you know, like the biomarker is a signature that's not that's not one thing you do a lab test for, but you do several tests and the whole profile gives you the biomarker.",

Um, and things like corticosterone increase rapidly with the stressor and then they kind of flat line. So if you're going to do chronic stress, you'll still get activation but it's much slower and then that's associated with immune responses, um inflammation, damage, all those things. So there's and then that is associated with a dysbiosis. So acute responses to stress or anxiety are not associated with immuno immune activation and and microbiome changes. Those are more chronic.

And so these what they what they do, right is um they express and also and the and the purpose for for those are to recruit uh immune cells to a particular site to help uh mediate if something's out of you know if there's too many microbes of one kind or another. Um, so the the neurons sense what's happening and and bring more immune cells to the site and thereby directly mediating neuroinflammation. Um, kind of like a conductor, right? And then uh the the idea of of um how that's what what the signal actually is, what's the or the micro bind to to the a neuron, um they have a representation or electrophysiological representation or activity. Um, something called uh like a neurogram if you will like for a particular or particular microbe, which is one of my ideas actually for a project is are there different um activation signatures um in the Vegas for particular microbes that can give you an idea of what's happening and how the brain is affected downstream and this is in the context of whatever disease state you want to think about PD, AD.

Um that is uh when um there have been you know studies about redox potential in microbial communities for decades, but there's also a huge body of literature that talks about how hard it is to have reproducibility across experiments. So could you have a redox potential measured in one study, it's probably reasonable to be consistent within a study, but across studies, the numbers that they change by like or like uh orders of magnitude of 10 or 100 um that are um that are dramatic. And one of the things that um I'm interested in if anyone has comments on this is um how can we measure metal ions better in the gut and in real time and this has been a huge challenge in the chemical biology field. Um this is really hard with iron um in in the like in a complex system um where we are is like synchrotron is the only way you can actually measure um iron speciation as far as I know right now um in um biological systems. So it's like doable, but it's not does anybody know how to use one? I don't. I know you can like get time on these, but um it's really complicated.

Uh or would the way that we deliver said drug, if it's a short chain fatty acid for example, if we just feed that into the diet versus uh changing the microbiota so that we increase short chain fatty acid capability from the from the microbiota itself, does does that have an effect on the pharmacokinet pharmacodynamics of the drug's stability or access to a different tissue site. Um, and then finally, this conversation about metal ions, there's a lot that sort of was happening while I was trying to get these notes um together, but it sounded like ultimately really there are indications that the microbiota has something to do with uh heavy metal metabolism. There's a lot that we don't understand and technically we don't we don't understand it because there are so many technical challenges just in terms of measurement, reporting across studies and one thing that could really advance the field here would be sensors for metal content and species uh in vivo in real time.

But you know, it's not it's not in an organism, these cells are getting multiple signals at the same time. There's there's a few people systems biology who study these things, right? You know, who look at a particular cell type and, you know, we use reductionist systems where again, we're looking at one side of kind, but they integrate signals from multiple different cytokines and they see very different responses than the additive effects of the individual cytokines, right? So I think in the context of a of a living organism, you know, I think one of the things I think would be important in this area is just if we're going to, you know, tackle the problem of of, you know, cytokine or neurotransmitter signaling to and from cells, maybe we shouldn't look at as like one side of kind or one neurotransmitter at a time, right?",

So like in the gut, for example, we know that to go back to, you know, old pictures, there are old pictures showing that all of the nerve, you know, nerve endings in the gut are surrounded by mass cells. Like completely chalk full just like right next to them. And um, you know, we know that there are these kinds of interesting instances of uh even um they're they're not well not well studied still these days, but even in rodents actually, it's been shown that you can have conditional allergic responses. So basically that you do classical conditioning of ring a bell, give an allergen, ring a bell, give an allergen, ring a bell, give an allergen and after however many conditioning events, you can ring that bell and the the rat or mouse will actually have all its mass cells degranulate. Um, uh, these are papers from in the 80s in science that never get cited. Um, so maybe that's kind of the thing is actually that it's where where that boundary ends where the nervous system no longer is able to do that, to coordinate that function itself, then it has to speak to the immune system.

So a more diverse microbiome has less activated microglia and microglia are the immune cells of the brain generally. They're they're basically brain um specific macrophages. There are macrophages and monocytes that enter the brain but microglia play the main role in terms of um surveying and responding to foreign invaders, but they have many other roles and one of them is um is pruning synapses and contributing to potentially neurodegeneration if they're too upregulated or maintaining proper synaptic health. So it's just one feature, but I think it's really cool that there is a correlation between diversity in the microbiome as well as the microglial activation.",

Uh, so given that the short chain fatty acids we talk we heard Bob tell us about and also the serotonins and the hormones that we just are talking about, we can study how they enter the epithelial cells or how they are secreted uh across and how they transport across the membranes or through the epithelial layers which will contribute to the communication part of this question. Uh, how does the communication happen? But is are the molecules small enough or the metabolites small enough to just penetrate through the cell membrane versus the receptors. And question is that, you know, if you knock off the receptors, does the communication still happen? So identifying part of it is not my expertise, but if given the data that these are the metabolites that are found, uh, we can talk about the communication part of it because there is enough uh details available now about the epithilia of the gut uh and also the bacterial membrane itself and the bacterial porins that really transport the metabolite in and out of the material cell also. So sort of you know the walls of the two uh, you know, the the epithelial cells and the bacterial cells and the the if you know the metabolites then the communication piece of it, how that is happening can be model at a molecular level at the atomistic level. And that can provide a lot of information. The other piece that is now growing that if we have a body of data that given these are the microbial species in a in the gut and the associated metabolites, there is uh this whole uh new computational tool of big data where we can start putting together that, you know, what is the correlation between having a list of bacteria and having the metabolites and what is that correlation?

And there has been a lot of uh discoveries actually that way. Um, like um again, I I like in terms of like super conductivity, that's also the same. They were actually started with computational works that they predicted that this is going to be like with this given like just a specific angle. Like if you have two graphene sheets, if you rotate them by 1.1 degree, for example, you are going to get super conductivity. It started with theory, but then people try to do that because you know, think about it. How many different angles can we really try? And we are talking about 1.1 degree. It's it was so specific and actually then people could do it. They just focus on it, finally people one group could get it and it worked. Uh so it seems to be in some sense similar. Meaning we have really the see ocean of different things that could be of um, you know, could be the biomarkers and the only way that could work is machine, AI, which can tell us what are potential biomarkers.

And those can be, you know, the most significant ones based on whatever analysis you're running, but if it's an unknown, you're kind of stuck. The same is true for hypothetical genes in in a metagenomics data set. Um, the techniques are are getting better to get annotation and to ascribe um particular genes to a particular organism, but I'm still not sure how you can pick that out of the complex community De novo. So what I keep wrestling with is is there a way to use some kind of maybe big data approach to identify those unknowns that are really important that you can then maybe use some computational spectra analysis machine learning to try to predict what that metabolite might be.
