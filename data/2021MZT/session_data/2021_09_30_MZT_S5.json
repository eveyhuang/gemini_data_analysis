Um actually I don't have any thoughts about networks at the moment per se. I mean I think people have been saying a lot of good things that can be represented by networks. But several people mentioned uh when we talk about the the opportunity for these to emerge and and how this is often happening in rural places and in places where um maybe medical access is less available. The other factor that I'm remembering from Christine's talk, she highlighted um places where humans are severely interfering with the environment like deforestation or forcing different I mean it goes I mean um someone Pilar already mentioned migration. Um but so forcing that to happen. So I guess I'm I'm curious um",

So I've worked with economists, I've worked with um sociologist and most of my work on doing my PhD was in rural communities. And one of the things that we were not really paying attention to was the human movement or that it was a very cultural aspect. Uh so there was indigenous communities in the Gran Chaco region, which is really interesting if we talk about anthropogenic change because that's at the expansion of the agricultural frontier. So there's a lot of deforestation, human displacement happening. But one of the things that caught us our attention, we were like doing yearly uh entomological surveys to collect triatomines. And from one year to the next, people will move. Like they literally destroy their house, they're mud houses and build them somewhere else. We're like, we could not not find the house to do like a longitudinal surveillance. And and then we understood that it was just a cultural thing. It was also enhanced by the socio economic conditions. Um but it they were semi nomadic communities. So you cannot and that had a huge impact on the population of the vector because you didn't give enough time for the vector to um create high densities. But on the other side, you create really um the house are very precarious, so more opportunities for any bug outside bug to invade and have an infestation in that house. So it had a really interesting tradeoff just on without even thinking about how people get exposed to it, just on the vector population. And we were not really thinking about that because culturally to us it's like, well, you've been in this house, you're at least going to be there for a couple years. Uh but they would move frequently. And so we started working with sociologists trying to understand why because if we want to do an intervention and design an intervention strategy to spray the houses, we need to take into account that movement because it's not the same if you're spraying a house and it's going to last for the effect is going to last for this long, whether it's like, no, it's not going to last because in three months they're going to be somewhere else. Um so yeah, I do think that's a really key part of it and that's kind of what it actually drove my interest in trying to incorporate the human, the cultural and behavioral aspects.",

I feel like one of the shortcomings here is is some type of early detection system, right? As as the pathogens are moving into these habitats whether it's through environmental change, we've now created an environment where domestic species like can now move into that area where they previously didn't or we've increased human populations in these areas but or we've increased livestock deforestation and then growing livestock in these areas. Um we don't know what's happening as we're cutting down these trees and changing these ecosystems, what types of pathogens, what types of threats are actually there and we're often reactive. Oh now we see the the infections are happening but it's already too late at that point because it's already kind of taken off or got the snowball effect. But the development and this is probably futuristic but some type of technological advancement that allows us to early detect in these interface systems threats. And I don't know what those are but I'm just throwing out Star Trek type ideas of where we could go with this in the future.",

Uh, but they're the good the good thing is like you can think about targeted interventions. like, okay, we understand that dogs may be a problem for this sonatic diseases, especially for some of them are really infectious um to the vector to other hosts. So maybe we can think about how we limit the trans the onward transmission if we cannot limit the population or if limiting the population just get us to a point but we cannot uh we can't eliminate dogs.

They both in a single model and they both independently. And so coming up with multiple ways to sample. We don't always have to rely on genetic sequencing.

And then thinking because there's a number of modelers in here, thinking about incorporating multiple types of data sets together into a single predictive model and these can be disparate types of models. some researchers in in my uh at my research center have done some work with um skunk rabies and they were able to show that both case data, you know, just positive individuals and then the subset of those being genetic sequences and then the phylogeography of those genetic sequences both predicted the wave front and the wave speed equally well with each other into a single model. They both in a single model and they both independently. And so coming up with multiple ways to sample. We don't always have to rely on genetic sequencing. Can we come up with something that is sort of a proxy sample that helps us understand these kind of wave fronts and transmissions and helps us get in front of that and then and then have this intervention moment early on.",
