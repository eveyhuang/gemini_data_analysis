So I guess that's how I link to this but I wanted to say that sometimes at the really bottom level quantum effects might be important for signaling.",

But I I think we can go down this weird road of saying how do you define biochemical? But maybe we don't want to push that. But but I think that's a fair point. I mean like it could be a mechanical change, it could be something else, right? But I think for us anyway, it really is, you know, some interaction which in our case is a biochemical interaction causing like a functional change in the players that we're sort of defining as the the the system. But it's true that like for depending on the scale of the the sort of output or phenotype you're interested in, right? It may be that you require integration over multiple of these events or, you know, that one of these events happens for a long period of time or something like that. So I think that sort of echoes Michelle's point that it really like the the functional output depends on the signal at hand. Really there are and there are measured examples of cases where you need several short time scale events to be happening in a small time frame and the system is integrating over that before it makes a sort of decision. A good example of that is like immune cell activation by like T-cell activation works that way for example. And then there are other cases where it may be that one, you know, enzyme-substrate interaction leads to another one then there's an amplification step like Michelle was saying downstream and so",

Which is different, right? Because you have multiple inputs and outputs constantly going, right? And at the end the cell makes a decision. You know, so to me that final decision and it can be also conflicting inputs and outputs, right? Like so so the cell has to somehow process it, right? It's getting multiple inputs, those inputs can all go and and and direct into a certain fate or a certain process but they can also be conflicting, right? At this point it's interesting to understand how the cell makes a decision, right? How the cell chooses or how it computes all these different types of inputs and at the end decides, right?

Your players are your constraints and your function is actually the entropy function rho log rho. When you maximize your uncertainty under the knowledge of these players the constraints of these players and then whatever comes out of that is essentially the signal. It might be a canonical distribution function if your players are position NVT is are the players this is the only things that you know then the signal is this Gaussian distribution function. And so I think that's a very clear so and then essentially and that's where I think the the the field definition comes in every field brings in its own constraints and therefore what you call signal depends entirely upon what you're calling constraints. It's a signal under the prejudice of certain constraints or knowledge that you are are are putting into your into your thought process. So so yeah like again like in energy signaling that we often look into it's very difficult to see energy the way we classically define it moving through a cell it will have to so what can be monitored is some manifestations of energy transfer which can happen by changing concentration by monitoring things like the concentration of reactive species that tells you or or energy rich metabolites this is where the energy is moving through.",

I think that the brain is a wonderful example of this because it's it's these neurons that have these basically binary signals in terms of action potentials right they have depolarization events and a pre versus post synaptic neuron communicates that message electrochemically basically right so depolarization here causes depolarization here but they're they're not physically touching right so unlike a circuit there's no way for that electrical information to be transduced and so it's gated by chemistry right that that is exocytosed here and then affects receptors on the post synaptic neuron to then you know relay that signal downstream. And it's it's interesting because I think this is where that concept of tools comes in as well. Being able to measure action potentials is something we've been able to do for at least about a decade or so and we've used that almost as a proxy for their chemical signaling but as new tools become available to look at the chemistry it's becoming apparent that for every action potential there could be as little as a 5 10% probability of actual neurochemical release so it it touches on a lot of themes I think that we've been discussing here about how more sensitive tools spatially and temporally are allowing to see kind of these new dimensions of information. The other kind of way that we classically at least in neuroscience probe how it is that that these signals are transduced is with pharmacology right so we add drugs to the brain we know that they agonize or antagonize receptors and so we make conclusions about what that agonist or antagonist action does and and where the role of those receptors are in the pre versus post synaptic neurons and but it's still I think that's still a very hazy method of of understanding signaling in a in an organ that that arguably is the main signaling pathway of the entire body.",

So so so essentially in this in the sense of this information theory theoretic setup what happens is like you start increasing fluctuation and you reach this critical fluctuation where you suddenly see amplification and then you cross that fluctuation again and that amplification this amplification is gone. So so that that that critical noise is extremely is extremely important like and again as the function of what you have what one has chosen the knowledge bounds to be this this this fluctuation essentially changes according to our knowledge. If our knowledge is too little then there is huge amount of fluctuation that is required. It's called like in statistical mechanics it's called dissipation fluctuation theorem. So if you have like a lot of knowledge then might be you can deal with critical amount of fluctuations. If you don't have too much so so yeah I think that's that's that's critical actually like so fluctuations are critical for amplification that's what I would say like that at least in a lot of areas that has been shown.",

You you still get regulation but if you look at an individual cell it may look completely different from from what your population looks like right and and that's that's maybe what you what what Markita describes about action potentials you know so some 5 to 10% of the time it works but most of the time it doesn't. And if you look at all these population studies you say oh yeah enhancers need to contact promoters and then transcription happens. When you look at an individual cell and they're they're far apart there's just in no good way for them to communicate so but still it works. It's it's still the cell that we think it is.

So so definitely within the cell that has been shown many a times. out like at an intercellular level I will not be able to comment but I haven't because I don't know too much about it. But definitely within the cell one of the reasons the redundancies are created so that it can be robust. And like essentially something that material systems try to achieve. They are engineered systems are very very efficient not as robust possibly. And that's what natural systems are basically more adaptable and this adaptability comes in from the robustness from the possibility of having multiple signaling pathways with different weights and the weights of these pathways switch depending upon what environment you are in.

So it's like a like that's why I like in a very clear case of a chemical signal called ROS its origin is starting from a chemical reaction at picoseconds and then its biological relevance stays up to seconds beyond which even if it stays in the cell no one cares the cell has already made its way out. So let's say let's say that is one signal then what else can we think of as as interesting signaling pathways and might we can put in a times like I possibly managed to speak on on this particular thing that would be good actually then we can at least have a table of cool things.",

So we we've been thinking about and and this is with some colleagues who have different expertise about how can you map out in time the cascades through which these cells go and which ones of them actually make it to the final state and then can we back propagate and measure this kind of architecture of of that pathway in that sense I mean is it signaling I don't know but but so the one big thing there is we don't know the players we don't know what's going to change but at the same time it would it's also difficult to follow individual cells through that process. So so the idea that we have been putting forward it did not get funded but was to to put some sort of barcodes in the starting population so these barcodes get amplified so we can track daughter cells through the entire process and then find the barcodes that make it into the final sample and then back track and at every single time do these fishing experiments and and see what is the population the distributions of states that we have at different time points and can we just construct the flow through this network of of states.",

There's all these levels. Um, okay, so we have uh maybe five or maybe 10 more minutes to do our discussion and then we've got to uh help Abhishek put together our slide. So if we have any more, so we've talked pretty big picture here. Do we have any more uh signaling pathways that uh we really want to say is an important thing to study um as a group, um or are we want to be more general about the context, the players, the architecture, the integration of signals, the amplification of signals.

So so that is is really a thing. I don't know exactly how it happens. There must be some some cascade coming through the cytoskeleton probably to the nucleus. Maybe it's just a volume change that makes different things accessible or or leads to different mechanisms like say condensate formation affected by density or or pressure in that sense, which then activates different parts.
