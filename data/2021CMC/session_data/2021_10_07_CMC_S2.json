So understanding how structurally metabolites use information in chemical structure to communicate in different regulatory pathways. And a couple of the things that I thought of for this particular session were really how do we understand how sort of at the level of transcription, these transcriptional networks within the cell, how do they sense and regulate local membrane environments? So really how do you take the sort of physical chemistry of a membrane and integrate that into the the feedback mechanisms that the cell uses to control how much of each thing is made and what signaling networks are turned on. And the other thing that I thought might be interesting is now that there's a lot of hype around sort of condensed phases or condensates, how do those condensed phases in different parts of the cell interact with different membranes and different organelles. So I thought those both might be interesting topics to discuss.",

Some of the questions that I've been interested in include a lot of these models that we talk about for organization, subcellular organization depend on concepts of diffusion and and like gradients and so forth. We know that it's extremely highly organized and tightly packed in and all these membranes and so what is the what really is going on very locally on one hand and also if it is so local how can we both what limits does that place on if we want to exploit that or what benefit does that give if we want to exploit this precise compartmentalization in medicine and so forth.",

So yeah this is should be an exciting session. So one yeah maybe two points I I wanted to highlight that I'm curious about. So one the first part was about sort of unknown unknowns what Roberto described and that's related to sort of lipid modifications or structures that we may not even know about yet that might be important for lipid identity, vesicle identity and sort of like yeah the the dynamic assembly processes. And then a little bit related to that related in terms of our research we think a lot about protein complex assembly and but how lipids interact with proteins and kind of influence the process is something that I think is still much less known about and is really hard to study with current techniques because they're either related to analyzing lipids or proteins but studying this in complex is really challenging.",

I'm a cell and developmental biologist and my lab my lab says that we study actin cytoskeleton but actually throughout my career what I found out is when I study actin cytoskeleton what I'm really studying is membrane. So that's why I'm in this group. And so when I'm thinking about membranes I'm I'm usually or very often thinking about actually the the plasma membrane and how the actin cytoskeleton interacts with the plasma membrane and exerts forces on the membrane but also gets signals from the plasma membrane and really what are all the interactions between actin and the membrane. And and the sad thing is is that I I still feel like we really don't know a lot. And and then it gets worse than that because recently we've started thinking about the the the plasma membrane as sort of a composite material because it's really sandwiched between two other materials, the actin cytoskeleton on the inside of the cell and the glycocalyx on the outside of the cell. And unfortunately you know for currently only really two of those materials get any attention, actin and and membrane and we've really so we have like all of these decades of modeling etc etc biology that's all driven by understanding the membrane and the actin but completely ignoring that there's this huge glycocalyx on the outside of the cell and how that would actually influence what's going on with the membrane and you know ultimately why I care about this I I work in embryos so I want to understand how cell shape changes is driving morphogenesis. And so we're also thinking about this in terms of it's not just each of these materials but how do they work together to give you something like cell shape change and ultimately tissue building. So that's me.",

So I've been working with undergraduate students at Santa Clara University to use second harmonic generation to monitor the thermodynamics of drug absorption to model plasma membrane systems which is why the membrane is very important to me. We prepare artificial lipid membranes. We ideally want to incorporate some membrane-bound proteins into these membranes to kind of monitor how can drugs bind in the nice thing about our laser spectroscopy method is we don't use any fluorescent tag or any kind of label. We just monitor at the wavelength of for example the drug that binds and absorbs into the lipid bilayer. I think I'm interested in I guess making better models. So right now my models are very simple like physical models not computational models but I'd like to make them more complex and more similar to real world. I know a lot of you work with real cells and I haven't I haven't done any real cell work for plasma membranes. I've just been working on artificial lipid complexes and I'd like to make it kind of connect those things together and be able to with my laser setup we have kind of average we're monitoring or getting signal from everything all within the laser beam and I'd like to be able to kind of have more spatial distribution and better resolution of understanding what's going on with kind of individual things within a thing that I'm studying like the locations of things.",

So mainly I use spectroscopies to characterize metal binding sites.

So one of the things that's always bugged me about the paradigm for how copper is transported through the cell is there's not really any explanation for how the how metal ions get to the transporter or or are carried away exactly. It doesn't seem to make sense that diffusion is the process involved here. So I I would like to better understand how the membrane itself can be kind of a scaffold for organizing proteins both inside and outside the cell so that pathways work quickly enough for for biology to happen.",

And so my questions were related to how we think about membranes and how it's a fluid lipid fluid material but actually maybe just a scaffold the support of a protein scaffold and should we just think about the other extreme would be to think about the membrane as just basically a protein membrane because it's so dense there are so many things on the membrane. And so that changes a lot about that would change everything about the way we think about how things are organized, how they move. And there's a very interesting paper came out a couple of years ago that even think maybe think about it as a gel. Maybe it could be the analogy they gave I think is beautiful is if you think about jello it's mostly water but there is a protein meshwork that makes it like a gel. And they think about the same way about a lipid membranes that it could be it's very fluid at first sight but you don't need that much anchors and that much network behind it that could be related to actin but to make it like a gel and so that that changes a lot of mechanical properties and all that stuff so a lot of things to think about I don't know.",

I am an engineer by training but my lab studies synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. In particular, I'm interested in designing and constructing microbial consortia or co-cultures with novel functions such as biosynthesis of value-added products. I'm also interested in using biosensors to regulate metabolic behaviors of cells as well as the dynamic interactions between cells in the consortia. One of the thoughts I have for this topic session is that how can we study the membrane protein functions to allow for effective transfer of metabolites between different cells inside a community or a consortia. For example, how can we use one membrane protein to secrete one metabolite from one cell and in the meantime use a variance of the same membrane protein to assimilate the metabolites into other cells to facilitate the cell to cell communication. And I would be very interested to hear new ideas about this kind of research direction. Thank you.",

If you want to do very high-powered stuff like with lasers or something then you know you need a simple system and then if you're doing really complex stuff your methods are you know maybe more general. So so it sounds like we need better models of membranes and then also it's been pointed out that the way to think about membranes is now evolving, right? So the cartoon of the lipid bilayer with a few proteins, I mean we know there's a lot more proteins than that. So I I heard glycocalyx which I assume people know about but maybe they don't. They're just thing on top and then there's the maybe it's more of a protein thing and maybe more of a gel. Okay, so so there's some interesting sort of chemical physical ways to think about membranes which you know if we started from that maybe we get to a very different place. I mean and then there's the question of diffusion that I heard like how do things really get to the membrane? That's actually kind of a lot of things people have talked about signaling and so forth as well. Okay, so I'm going to stop talking. And then what I was anybody like to start to jump in and say well is there you know that's one question should we think about membranes in a totally different way which may then lead to us getting better models for them I suppose. Or are there questions and tools that we can think is a need that should be developed or studied. Okay, so I will I'm going to dial down. Okay, Alison, yes.",

I mean what what sort of landscape do we have in between a fluid membrane environment that's regulated by sort of these loose intermolecular associations between lipids and and then once we start to integrate different proteins and different lipid identities and I think this goes to Dmitri's question too is like how do we think about the the actual mechanical fluidity of this membrane and it goes back to Catherine's point how does that either facilitate sort of this two-dimensional diffusion of transport substrates and how does it sort of maintain a physical integrity that will localize certain processes or prevent certain mixing events that might lead to you know undesirable interactions.

And so I think it seems reasonable that in some cell function like like dividing for example it seems reasonable to suspect that the cells the cell membrane would have some collective motion together. But then in some other you know like localized compartmentalized cell signaling then those kind of large scale cell you know membrane flow may not be very effective but rather they want to have localized organized membrane domains and compartments that helps to facilitate you know the the receptor signaling at a local level so I think it might it might vary depending on what cell functions are involved but but we don't know you know why I mean how does the cell know what what what mechanisms to to use and to trigger trigger this right?",

And so from from the protein side yes I mean different proteins are known to associate with the different or localized to different regions of the the membrane. And you could I mean you could engineer proteins or complexes to stick to different membrane regions maybe on there to localize them and kind of mimic those processes but then again that's a very yeah it's a very reductionist approach of course. The other point maybe to raise too is from the detection side I remember a conversation we had last year I think maybe with at a similar style or topic about in sort of probes to even study different membrane properties and I think there's I mean there's a lot of advances made like different environmental sensitive fluorophores that that exist but they're still I think from what I understand they're relatively crude and sort of like very low resolution that we have an have an understanding of different membrane properties so there's I think a lot of room still to refine those.",

We have a few probes that are would be Raman active with you know tags on them that would be useful. I think one of the things that's a limitation currently that people are obviously working on and making great strides in is the sensitivity if you're looking at very low abundance molecules the sensitivity is is kind of not nearly as high as if you use fluorescent tags or what have you depending on your system but but I think all of those things with Raman people are very interested in understanding sort of like the endogenous as we've all been talking about probes perturb the system and they're not as versatile as looking at the endogenous lipid metabolites.

And yeast have a cell wall that's been there for, you know, studied pretty well for a long time. And for example, for cytokinesis, everybody is focused on the acting contractile ring that generates force, but actually the more it goes, the more we realize that the cell wall assembly is polymerization is actually creating a lot of force that pushes the membrane inwards. And so the the actin ring might be just there just to localize things, not even to generate force. I mean, there are some hypotheses like that. So with the glycocalyx, it's the I've seen things that are that were going along the same lines of like, actually it does a lot of things and everybody's been kind of ignoring it because it's just outside the cell and you know, nobody cares what's outside, but actually more people care these days.

And and then you bring up yet another great point, which is that while you may look at the plasma membrane, you constantly have, you know, the membrane trafficking pathways that are adding new stuff and taking stuff away at the same time. And so these, you know, so so we talked a lot about structure, which of course is is important. I back up everything that I heard earlier, but then when you start thinking about dynamics, it becomes even more complex because it's it's not a static, you know, it it's not a static thing. It's there's constantly stuff coming in and and stuff coming out. And how you know, how how all of those interactions how all of that is coordinated and how how do these systems handle that? I mean, I just it's it it's so so complex when you just zone in on one thing, but then when you actually think about it in the systems at you know, like at at let's say at the cellular systems level, then the complexity just grows. And so yeah. And I and I loved what Catherine said. Um, she said she said it so nicely, how how do you make membranes work quickly enough to do the stuff that they have to do? And I'm thinking about that constantly in terms of the plasma membrane, like how how would you coordinate all of the incoming traffic and the outgoing traffic as well as changing the shape at the at the same time. And I know that many of you are thinking about it in terms of, you know, like how do you take stuff in? Um, and so how do you make all of that how does the, you know, how how does that interface with the biophysics of the of the membrane of that material and how does it how does it happen? And I just you know, we we see that it's a problem as biologists, but I think we we don't have good tools and all of the things that you said about probes being perturbative, that is that's like that's always the problem for us. It's like anytime anybody comes up with a new probe, it sounds great on paper. One group makes it work, and then, you know, we try to take it into our cell and everything falls apart. So, um, so, you know, I'm I don't I don't have solutions. I mean, of course we're, you know, of course we're doing theory.

Um, in that, you know, a lot of times when we look at and I'll return to lipids just briefly because I don't I really don't know that much about the glycocalyx, but I think it's an excellent point to consider, you know, intracellular membrane environments that could be influenced similarly to the extracellular side of the membrane. But for lipids, we tend to look at them as just being like this big jungle or tangle of of carbon and hydrogen in cryo-EM when when we see them in cryo-EM structures, which is kind of rarely to be honest. But a lot of times, you know, the key attributes of a certain stretch of a membrane will be whether, you know, how many double bonds are introduced in the phospholipid tails of the lipids in the bilayer. And and I think the fact that so many that in the PDB you don't see the membrane, you know, we're losing a lot of information about how the shape of the lipids influence the types of proteins they interact with and then, you know, even beyond the PDB, how that influences the dynamics of those particular proteins. So I think one thing that would be kind of a pie in the sky is to look at sort of the shape-based complementarity between different types of lipids and different types of membrane proteins that might either localize them in the same place at in the simplest perspective, but also as we're talking about curvature and different scaffolding proteins that interact with lipids to make these invaginations and so forth.

This is just really broad, but some stuff that I thought was really good started coming out. Structure, this particular point that it's structure plus dynamics to give us the function, I thought, so yeah, so I have that and but you know, there's so many unknowns. How is it regulated? What's the coordination? What's the sensor? How do you model it? And then we had to started getting into how do you study membranes. And then I had this expanded section here on how the shape of the membrane, this should be a separate, shape of the membrane influences the proteins that can interact with and looking at the complementarity between membrane shape and protein complex shape and to like ID possible pairs but kind of map it on a larger scale so that you can make inferences about composition to shape, like this axis, lipid composition shape to protein. And then our conversation went into intracellular membrane, which I thought was really cool because it brings up the different chemistries that are encapsulated with each one. We talked about endosomes, but there was also, you know, peroxisomes have different differential oxidation perhaps bilayers or lysosomes.
