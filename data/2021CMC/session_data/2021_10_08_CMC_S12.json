So my lab the main techniques that we are using is we are interested in the function of RNA modifications. The main techniques we are using is CRISPR screening to identify the key enzymes which may regulate the important RNA modifications in certain cellular processes. And we use a liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spec to quantify the levels of RNA modifications and we do high throughput sequencing to pinpoint where are those modifications in human genome. And during COVID I got more and more interested in phase separation, this topic. That's why we started to do proximity labeling mass spec to determine the protein and RNA constituents in the phase separated compartment.",

I'm in the chemistry and biological sciences department at Vanderbilt University and we're a chemical biology group looking at coordination of protein-protein interactions. So we're really interested in how protein interactions play a role in protein folding, biogenesis and protein trafficking. And so applications are protein misfolding diseases, so how those are caused by dysregulation of these processes and then the other aspect is viral infections, so how do viruses take advantage of the protein homeostasis network in the infected cells and kind of use that to to help fold and assemble the virus particles. And so then we use a lot of mass spectrometry as our main main sort of technique of interest to study these protein complexes, so affinity purification mass spec. So this this topic really is kind of very close to home. And I'm really excited because one of the aspects I think that's really kind of challenging for us is sort of we think a lot about sort of temporal resolution, what is the sequence of protein interaction events as proteins get folded and trafficked, but then there's of course also the spatial aspect to this, right? These proteins traverse the secretory pathway or they get get localized to different parts of the cells and how how can we develop techniques that can can capture this efficiently.",

Well, okay so this is my swan song I guess or my last facilitation and I I have this sort of two-step thing in my head when I I was responsible for well me and Romy creating this this thing. But so to Tanya's question about protein biochemistry and proteomics, why is it still a problem, the compositional proteome? The the composition of matter still has not been defined. So that that's a foundational statement that we haven't sequenced the human proteome and that's one of my passions and so I won't hide that, I'll in fact just lay it out. But the supposition is that that if we could do that in in do it with 100% coverage, you know it may shock you to know that proteomics, compositional proteomics is a you know 0.1x coverage science whereas genomics is a 50x coverage. So that you know when you when you look at the modern state of play, that's one of the reasons Tanya we don't have this locked down, not even close. And so that's like a first step but then the supposition is if you do that well, then you can take the second step and you could then invigorate single molecule protein sequencing, single cell proteomics and and in space, do do what we did for what we do single cell RNA-seq now with a depth of about 3 to 4,000 transcripts per cell if you're if you do it you know well and you're successful. Single cell proteomics right now compositionally is about at 1,000, 1,500 proteins per cell but they're little peptides, they're not the full proteoforms. So that's the sort of thing that that I was imagining to to get both compositional and spatial proteomics on the rails and but that I now I've just layered way too much of my own personal bias on these three questions. But at least it tees us up. Maybe the first point, do we need to sequence the proteome in compositional proteomics, just that first point. What are your what are your thoughts or biases or you just tell me to be quiet.",

When we were talking about you know kind of these medical tissues like tumors, we want to study the tumor microenvironment, all of that in vivo stuff. Without really spatial resolution, of course imaging is important here for sure, we cannot really know exactly what's going on compared to just basic proteomics sequencing based. A lot of these models were done in cell lines which is great, you know that provide the first draft of information we can you know narrow down, get a prioritize list, but I think this is really getting a step closer to the to the real kind of application that we want to do eventually.",

So if you don't know what you're looking for, you can usually get a pretty good idea. It's inherently limited because we have to generate ions, so that's kind of an inefficient process and not everything ionizes in the cell, although proteins pieces of protein should. And I think for spatial imaging mass spectrometry especially when it comes to proteins, there's an inherent limit on it's copy number. So like you know are you ever going to see one protein if that's all a cell makes of it? Like is that enough to get that one thing ionized? I don't think so. So like for the imaging mass spectrometry with proteomics, it's been limited to high copy number small proteins. So the things that the cell abundantly makes and unless the cell is very large, it's not been a high spatial resolution. So like the modern instruments, the best you can kind of get is a five micron image and I think you kind of need that bigger area because again it's copy number, so how many copy numbers in a cell do you expect?",

So that's on the one hand but then if you yeah to do the spatial resolution I think you were really also limited I think in terms of like what the techniques are so with with MALDI ionization then it's really about like how large the laser size is to kind of ionize different regions or I think there's some some interesting sort of nano ESI based techniques on surfaces where you can kind of digest little droplets on on tissue preparations for example but again still I think in the micron range so like nowhere near single cell resolution or subcellular resolution.",

You know, so like companies like Quantum-Si or Nautilus or you know, there's been a lot of investment or at least promised investment to to not to to go single molecule because we can't amplify. We have no PCR, so we just have to get more sensitive or like what Ion Torrent did or Jonathan Rothberg is in this game with a company called Quantum-Si. But these, you know, these are very high-risk approaches. Um but it's the same yeah, Laura, your yeah, we're we're we go decade every decade and we still can't amplify proteins and and by the way, proteins, that's a myth, right? They're actually proteoforms. And you say, well what's a proteoform? Well, think about that all these technologies are going to run smack into the variation of proteins. When you guys talked about what you did like Ross, you know, post-translational modifications, we we don't we don't have a reference atlas for what proteoforms exist. All these technologies, they might be able to sequence right now a few amino acids using using single molecule approaches, but they're when they hit PTMs, they're going to it's going to delay them by a decade or you know. So, so I don't know if we do it with ion amplification or we go single molecule, um and then you run into what Alexis said about spatial, how do you, you know, even RNA-seq is having a hard time putting in spatial register their information. So those are three major challenges and I'll stop because I'm now rambling.",

So I think for the discussion if everyone has a link how does this sound for like so basically if we start with the obvious which is or mainly because Neil and I are probably sitting in the room, the limitations with mass spectrometry which could be an obvious answer to spatial proteomics is that it has these inherent limitations. So it's limited spatially by copy number, ionization efficiency and we don't really have a defined human protein or proteoform reference or database like we do for other technologies. So because of these things some of the inherent challenges we might hope to address are the amplification problem. And then the solutions we came up for for those and even if you can't amplify some of these don't directly address the proteoforms or the post-translational modifications. So maybe ways in which we can label, enrich or sort those and then sequence. And then the other challenge is do we just need new sequencing techniques other than mass spectrometry for proteins and peptides. And then there was a large discussion on reverse translation, molecular motors and like kind of using that can we use that technology in a creative way to address the challenge. Is there anything else that we should put in?",
