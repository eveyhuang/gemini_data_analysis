So the first thing that we have to do is identify who's going to be the speaker and who and and the the at the last session we actually had a person I mean the speaker would be the presenter. We actually found that having a presenter assigned that's the reporter and having a recorder assigned really helped to distribute the load. So I'm going to what I'm going to do is you're going to type in the chat box if you will a number between one and 100 and the person who gets closest to the the right answer they will be the reporter and the one who gets the second one is the recorder. So I don't know which is the preferred one because the last one the person who got the first one wanted to be the recorder not the reporter but anyway the closest to it will be the reporter and the second will be the recorder. And and to you know some people think oh I'll say 100 and then I'm going to be only half of it but I we we go around like a clock so so it's it's either way. So so that way it makes it even. So one two three four five six seven eight nine. Okay Catherine but you probably and we'll we'll see what happens. So and Joshua and Davide Davide symmetry broke from from Joshua. So I'm going to now turn on the my stopwatch and what I do just so you see this it's on right so it's just doing some arbitrary numbering and the last two digits is the one that of that number that's one that's really fast. So someone want to tell me to say stop say stop.",

If you go to slide 48 that will be where you're going to type your key points. And then Gulcin you there? Cool. So I'm going to put in the chat box and this is something everybody can see. So if you go there that's the where we were going to put in the breakout notes. Okay and what we're going to do next now that we know who the reporter and the recorder are is just go around the room and make sure that everyone has an opportunity to say their name and your location. We almost all know who your name and your location is so just name and location and the next item will be a something interesting and different. And this interesting and different is because Romy stole my idea the last time of foods. So I'm going to riff on foods and say what is your favorite restaurant? So just what is your favorite restaurant and that favorite restaurant you'll have to at least tell us the city so we can maybe someday know to go to it. So your favorite restaurant and in in the city okay. And I'm going to type in the chat box the order that I see all of your faces so that way you'll know the order in which you're going to give this remark in. And so if you can see the chat the if you can see not the chat box sorry I'm putting it in the Google Doc. So Wenjing and oh and I always tell people I just say your last name so that way you can correct my pronunciation of the last name but you say something different by saying your first name.

We don't really understand what it's doing but I I have noticed that some people that are experts in signaling take issue if you call it a signaling molecule and instead say they they prefer if you say that it's mediating signaling it's not a signaling molecule.

Um so there are chemical gradients that play a role as well like in that cause cell differentiation um therefore like um because like birth I I guess birth I I guess maybe like 50% of the baby more than 50% of babies that will be born correctly and uh so this process seems to be a really very um accurate process so um so right so so my question is just how much space of the error um is can be tolerated in the process and then the organism can still kind of self-adapt and self-correct um to a functional system.",

So now these two system are completely out of scale in timing wise right because one is going running hot and one is running cold and but eventually if you remove them after a few you leave them in this situation for a few hours and you take the embryo out then you get a fly. Right so so the embryo is somehow able to fix the asymmetry. It's unclear if there is a checkpoint where the embryo stops there and wait until it has fixed itself or if maybe the delay is slowly reabsorbed and so there's definitely I I think it's an interesting point that there's a great ability for the system to self-correct there is also though a great precision that is already built in.

So maybe before we go to the next I mean I think that the there's going to be a question we should explore and I'm going to pick on Judith on this to start it off on measurement. But but before we get to measurement can we how do you all feel about the importance of self-organization and and the fidelity of self-organization is that an important driver or not?

Um like in the same way that you know um yeah I mean sort of uh in any physical process you know you always have sort of a nucleation event and so if one simply claims that you know the formation of an embryo is a type of nucleation uh that then or sort of an initiation of some nucleation that um you know that that ultimately right the the robustness is you know whenever it's obtained is is then where self-organization takes over.",

They all function you know they all perform the same function but the distribute there's a distribution right of number of copies of receptors. There's a distribution of um you know there's a distribution of uh you know size and uh shape of the same uh organelles right in different cells. There's a distribution of like kinetics of chemical reactions even inside the same cell like for example you know endosomes they will have different kinetics of chemical reactions even when they perform the same functions. Um and um and also based on you know what we know about um the for the you know the phase separation in in the cell functions and clustering of proteins aggregation of proteins can see that there is a range of um sizes I guess you know um that just seems to lead the the same outcome. So from I guess this is more like observation rather than trying to explain why that is but based on the observation seems like there is quite a buffer room the cells are designed to have those buffer room that they would reach the same goal even if there's some deviation from in all those processes from the beginning of you know the expression of protein to to how how the signal pathways come together.",

Um but beyond that you know it's extremely hard to do from technical point of view technical difficulties. Also I I don't know a very effective way in fluorescence imaging that allow you to say you know this two these two signaling waves let's say they actually have some correlation rather than just coincidence.

Right? So so what how what's the right size? And is that does it depend on the on the particular type of signal, the particular type of function? Or is there some invariance? And is that something that one could try to develop a statistical mechanical theory to develop what's the right size scale or what is sort of a a way of of of framing size? And you know to for Gulchin's favorite question, what is self? You know in order to know self, you need how how much how big is it before there'll be enough signal to be able to recognize itself as opposed to not being distinguishable from others. So there's also so it may be nuanced by the fact that you need distinguishability. So does size matter? Simple question.",

And maybe we can start extracting some information and maybe using more computational tools, why neurons expanded themselves for so long beyond the size of any other cell type. So if size matter that much, why neurons are the exception? Right? Because for the same circuit, you could build same circuit with five neurons, but then why is it different? Why is it an exception? I think maybe we can start answering the question about size if we start looking at the exceptions.

And I think Gulcin got really excited by this idea of of size mattering and self that of the observation of cells having a kind of a size and what is the hidden theory or the the sort of the hidden principle that has driven that size? Is it like it's like a scaling law almost. What is the scaling law for the size of scales of size of cells and is it somehow connected to signaling and self-organization?
