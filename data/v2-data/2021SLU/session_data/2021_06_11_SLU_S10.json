Um so something that's really on my mind at the moment is looking at the world's, you know, the earliest eucarits to emerge on this planet. Even, you know, when we first see them in the fossil record, they have very sophisticated adaptations to living in a life in moving fluids. So the fluid environment is is one that is obviously you know, very selective, right? And there's a number the limited number of ecological tricks you can play in order to be successful in a fluid environment. And so thinking about exoplanets and particularly water worlds, I'm interested in thinking about are there predictable ways in which organisms might evolve on water worlds? Is there something about the chemistry or the viscosity of the water that we could you know, explore and think about, you know, what does what does what does a light what does an organism that is adapted to, you know, a really viscous or non-viscous or even sort of, you know, liquid hydrocarbon fluid look like? What are the tricks you might be able to play?",

But the things I was thinking about similar to Simon was maybe like in form the ocean perspective, you know, there are a lot of organisms today that can have adapted to live like at the edges of extreme environments like oxygen zones. And so um it's not necessarily that they could survive for long term. I'm specifically thinking about multicellular life. They can't survive long term within, you know, an oxygen poor environment, but they can they can they're adapted enough to kind of flip between the these extreme environments and maybe more habitable environments and these gradients though, are usually the locations that have the best energy availability or other important, you know, things that you need. So to me there was that question of are we talking about adaptation to the extreme environment itself or some sort of environmental gradient? And that sort of got me thinking about what Laura was saying in terms of how spatially far away some of these um just like stepping into volcanic zones and IO, you know, the distance at which you might find these extreme environments could be really important role in terms of creating these gradients that can be.",

Um if you have high tidal heating, there's no reason to expect that to die out with time and you might expect you have more extreme volcanism throughout the course of your planet's lifetime. So maybe there's sort of two scenarios here where you have one kind of planet that will have early early high volcanic fluxes that make the surface uninhabitable but it gradually dies off and at some point you have enough stable, you know, nice surface environments that you can have life start. whereas in a tidally extremely tidally heated uh scenario, maybe it's just always too much volcanism.",

Like often in ecology, like when we look at modern ecosystems, you need to perturb them in order to keep them healthy in order to keep sort of things diverse. And you look at the the geological record of extinction, you know, the number of species on this planet has increased throughout geological time and it's usually after mass extinction events that you tend to get major new biological innovations and big increases in the standing diversity for example generic or species diversity in the oceans. And so one advantage of having very short strong abiotic gradients especially is that they may change and move and drive things extinct and thus create new ecological opportunity. Like you need that selective pressure in order to drive natural selection. And so I think I finally managed to get my head around this that you know, a planet where there's lots going on and there there are more extremes, you are going to tend to generate more complex, more interesting ecosystems. Because otherwise even in extreme gradient if it's if it's if it's static then you you know, there's not much sort of there's not much for natural selection to operate on, right?",

So they have no seasons and they have no diurnal cycle. So everything we see there will be in a steady state. Um so there are temperature gradients and you know, the ocean and the winds are going to be blowing about and trying to flatten those gradients. But like nothing ever changes. Like the the sun doesn't move in the sky, right? So like maybe those planets are just inherently flawed as like a good place maybe not for life to originate like you said, but but uh for for life to stay healthy however you put it, you know, of kind of like repeatedly poking it and stressing it to try and have it um evolve well.",

But then eventually once life gets a foothold, then you want gradients and and changes in gradients and and and you basically want to stress the life to try and like force it to like loom and diversify.
