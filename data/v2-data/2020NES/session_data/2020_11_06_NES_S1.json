So in a microporous sorbent for example, rather than like the classical zeolite that maintains its exact structure even when it becomes in contact with CO2. If CO2 can induce a change in your adsorbent, then if the thermodynamics of that phase transition or change in the adsorbent are in the right way, they can mitigate some of the for example exothermic heat of absorption or endothermic heat of desorption for removing CO2. And I know people have done a little bit of similar types of things in the context of ionic liquids with looking at either precipitation reactions or some type of phase transition that can be coupled to CO2 absorption in an ionic liquid that just gives you another kind of knob to tune to try to access different thermodynamics than you would have if you were just focused on conventional kind of absorption or adsorption.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, I think that's an interesting approach that I hadn't really considered before. What I was referring to is more just a phase transition that's induced by adsorption or absorption in this sorbent material. So usually some type of structural phase transition or could also be some the what specifically is coming to mind are certain metal-organic frameworks that adopt rigid structures that have covalently attached flexible kind of amine groups on their surface that can bind chemically to CO2. And those amine groups are very dynamic and kind of moving all around in the absence of carbon dioxide, but when you get enough carbon dioxide such that you surpass a certain threshold partial pressure, it induces a phase transition in the amines so that they basically undergo what's effectively like a precipitation reaction and you form chains of ammonium carbamate. And so the thermodynamics of that phase transition are basically the opposite of the thermodynamics of CO2 absorption. And so that can reduce basically the overall net enthalpy change while you're still achieving a really high capacity and selectivity. So that's one example that comes to mind. There's other types of demonstrations with flexible metal-organic frameworks where you have basically structures that are non-porous and then when you achieve a certain threshold pressure of CO2 or gas on the outside of the framework, they expand to accommodate the gas. And that expansion again has the opposite thermodynamics, opposite enthalpy and entropy change as absorption of the gas. And so that could provide some benefits in terms of minimizing temperature fluctuations during absorption and desorption. And I think similar types of things are possible in ionic liquids with like precipitation reactions, but I think it's kind of an underexplored phase space in general and so there's probably more opportunities for other types of mechanisms like Andrew suggested where you could have benefits in accessing properties that you wouldn't be able to have if you just have a simple kind of absorption or adsorption process.",

So we have a recent paper looking at how we can use guanidinium bases, this is in collaboration with some of the folks at Oak Ridge National Lab, where you have this we actually sorb it in a liquid phase and then you form carbonate bonds which cause the sorbent, the solvent now become a solid, a crystallized solid. So then you crystallize it out and it has a much lower temperature of regeneration compared to the conventional carbonate. It's a water-heavy system, but then when you work on systems like that, there are all there are all these unconventional crystallization pathways and absorption pathways and coupling mechanisms that really open up new areas of fundamental science. So maybe direct air capture can serve as a pathway for unlocking some of those basic science questions too.",

Because then you don't have any counter-ions. So the architecture of making it might be also like a challenge itself. So like a lot of the adsorbent systems that are being done electrochemically now, they're done with some sort of liquid phase, but I feel like from the discussions, it sounds like if you can get rid of that liquid and have a direct gas stream passing by, you can do that, that's more efficient except you always need this sort of ionic conductivity.

One of the troubles we were running into because that was when we were talking about the whole capture and release mechanism where oxygen was causing a lot of problems for these competitive reactions that Xiao mentioned. The problem we were running into was just highly energy intensive to do that and we'd have to find some type of justification, you know we need ultra high pure oxygen for some other part of the process. Because if you're talking about cryogenics or membrane based separations and even so you'll still end up with ppm levels of oxygen so then you have to have some type of scavenger to remove all of that.

But I just wonder if there's significant enough swings in humidity and just kind of what the thermodynamics of that type of process are like.

So in the context of trying to actually capture CO2 from air, there is the enthalpy contribution which is trying to bind the CO2 to the surface and then there's the entropic contribution where we can effectively engineer a substrate so we can lock the CO2 molecule into that particular pore space. In the context of direct air capture, how important are entropic contributions like in terms of the energetic input, should we even does it even make sense for us to think about engineering materials for from an entropic capture point of view or does it simply make sense for us to just think about trying to engineer the enthalpic component of it. That is so I wasn't sure what the current thinking is along those lines.",

But like Chris said I think it is a very unexplored kind of area. It's less obvious to me I mean usually the enthalpy and entropy of absorption should be quite highly correlated because the more stronger the binding site you have for the gas the more constrained it is going to be on the surface and so there's usually not that much you can really do which is why maybe it makes sense just to focus on binding energy because the entropy is just going to kind of tag along. But that's where I think if you have more dynamic adsorbents or sorbents and things that respond and are not just inert materials but actually change in terms of the dynamics or structure as a function of CO2 partial pressure then you open up opportunities for thinking about engineering entropy.",

We might predict a structure but it might seem pretty much garbage at that point.

            "transcript": "So I think we have about 15 minutes left and I want to try one other idea to stir some some different thinking. You know in a lot of engineered systems you have control over temperature pressure other parameters. One of the challenging things about direct air capture is you know we're we're stuck with 400 ppm CO2. But one of the things I haven't seen discussed a lot is if you imagine deploying direct air capture in different places around the world you could imagine having conditions that range from say minus 20 to 40 degrees C. So if you were asked to try to do something with CO2 at 400 ppm at minus 20 degrees C how would you think about doing that differently from you know the ambient conditions that we're normally used to thinking about indoors 25 degrees C you know 30% relative humidity. And similarly if you were designing a process that could operate in you know Oman in the middle of summer you know you you might be dealing with 35 40 degrees C ambient temperatures. So I just throw that out there as a way to maybe stir different ideas. This is a challenge where we're going to probably have 10 or 20 or 50 solutions that might be customized to different locations around the globe. So would you change your way of thinking if you were stuck working at minus 10 C or or 40 C? So I'll just throw that out there as a possible question.",

            "transcript": "Chris my short answer to that is absolutely yes. So we've been looking at pathways to couple direct air capture with carbon mineralization specifically with the intent of trying to produce carbonates and one way to do that is to use conventional sorbents that are cheap so you could use amino acid solvents like sodium glycinate or even MEA and so you have a high concentration of carbonate ions that you can now react with your calcium or magnesium produce calcium magnesium carbonate have sufficiently high hydroxyl ions so you can regenerate your solvent. So you have a one pot process with internal recycling internal pH swinging. So that's so that really drives down the cost of capture and mineralization but it needs higher temperatures because of the thermodynamics of CO2 sorption because we're trying to couple sorption and crystallization. This is a process that would not work in very cold climates like if we're trying to do this in the arctic there simply is not going to be enough thermodynamic driving force for that. There are other approaches to couple mineralization so for example again if you're trying to feed CO2 to an algae pond depends again where that algae pond is going to be located if it's going to be located in a temperate region versus in a really cold climate. So cold climate is a real challenge and I am not entirely sure what subset of solutions can be deployed there but if you but I do think there are a set of solutions that can be deployed in more temperate and tropical regions. So that's my two cents on the thinking and we do a lot of thinking around this space so I'd be very keen on hearing what we can actually do in really cold regions.",

            "transcript": "I'd say from the perspective of like microporous adsorbents I think it's probably the opposite for just conventional absorption processes in that colder climates are probably a lot easier than hotter climates just in that in designing you can design binding sites that have much lower affinities for CO2 and still be able to achieve very high selectivities just because you have less thermal energy available so the Boltzmann distribution is going to favor CO2 going to you don't need as large of a delta E between different gas molecules to drive a lot of CO2 into a material. As the regeneration piece though that's less clear to me exactly how that changes. I think selectivity and capacity are a lot easier you can have weaker binding sites but whether or not that actually leads to benefits on the regeneration side when you're already colder I'd have to think a little bit more about. I guess if you're in a cold climate but you had some geothermal heat source or something readily available then you that might offer a lot of advantages.",

I think that it will probably not affect the energetics too much because the potential is a really strong driving force but it will change all the different apparatus and the especially the solvent because most of the solvents that we use will probably solidify. So you might have to change the whole architecture to have something that is basically not solvent dependent like hopefully it's all immobilized and everything is just ionic without like a flowing solvent. So that's a really good question actually. It's a really good context for electrochemists to explore. I don't know if ionic liquids might be the best electrolyte then because they have a bigger range I don't know what their phase transition is.",
