And uh we were developing the uh SRS stimulated Raman scattering microscopy and we combined with the multiphoton fluorescence microscopy to visualize cellular metabolic activities. So um for my background, I think I combined the biological questions and also the um optical imaging technology together to um utilize this uh subcellular resolution imaging technique to visualize um the metabolic activities in cells and tissues or even live animals.

Um I'm a new assistant professor at UCSD. I started in November 2020 actually a pandemic year, so it's been exciting. Um my research is in nanophotonics. So I develop new nano optical material platforms and my hope is that um basically my research lab can leverage the complex manipulation of light that's enabled by these materials to probe the structural properties of biological matter both at the tissue scale or at the molecular scale. And kind of I think a a question that I'd like to ask the group uh related to this topic here label free imaging is can we maybe think beyond having markers and just use light as a marker in itself. So how can we structure light in complex ways um which is in some in many cases possible with nanophotonics uh to probe the the systems that we're interested in.",

So what we do is we make nanoparticle based sensors that we can put into in situ based measurement systems where we can look at spatial and temporal dynamics for analytes of interest in systems of interest where the analyte and the system are primarily what people are interested in funding. So work from DOE on energy stuff, NIH on health stuff, NSF on environmental stuff. But our core technology is all how can we make these nanoparticle based probes that we can put into biological systems and most of our questions revolve around the area of homogeneity and heterogeneity in these biological samples where life is not the same in all three dimensions. It's all over the place and chaotic and trying to measure that is one of the big challenges that we're trying to address.",

Uh my original training is applied uh optics and optical physics uh was developing components in optical fiber gratings and inverse problems. Then from there I moved to biophotonics and imaging during my post doctoral work. We worked on near infrared optical imaging, some x-ray imaging and in my lab currently we are looking at techniques where we can enhance the contrast in soft tissue at depth without having intrinsic contrast if possible, but we also look at contrast enhanced imaging. Some of the work is in looking at uh maximum information from every detected photon using single photon counting detectors and using it for phase contrast x-ray imaging, understanding how phase variations in x-ray can generate additional contrast without uh contrast agents and how do you then model this light propagation and and retrieve the information back uh to get additional information which you can otherwise not get for example in current mammography and other. So one big goal would be uh label free enhancing contrast early stage detection of cancers. Uh so yes Kevin uh Kevin just mentioned working with contrast agent. We are also looking at contrast agents for these advanced techniques. Uh while that is not the ultimate goal, we we can learn a lot about heterogeneity like uh you mentioned earlier uh classification uh what are the limits we can understand by using contrast agents. So both both are I think needed um to continue. So there is some interest also in multimodality coming back to the near infrared optical imaging uh that I was working in the past. So now there are the field has advanced since I last worked on it and I guess I've learned some more from doing other areas. So there is some interest in coming back to the near infrared optical ultrasound and these multimodality techniques and how can you combine information from these uh so those would be some of the future goals.",

Uh, before this, I was at UCLA and uh, before that I did my grad school from University of Michigan. Uh, I also hold affiliate position at the University of Michigan. Um, so my research, uh, it can broadly be divided into two parts. One is very similar to what Kevin mentioned. So I also work with nanoparticles. Um, we develop different types of nanoparticles, polymeric based, metallic, hybrid. Um, and then we use it to get different kinds of information from animals or even from inside the cells. Um, and with these nanoparticles, we use different kind of optical imaging modalities such as fluorescence, photoacoustics, um, and even basically use it to enhance the scattering from from samples. Uh, we use them for diagnostic applications as well as for therapeutic applications. So it would be like theranostic nanoparticles. But there is also the other part of my research where I work with label free microscopy. Uh, so one of the things I do it's called holographic microscopy, uh, which basically depends on the phase change of light as it goes through the sample. And the type of imaging we do, it's an on chip imaging methodology where we do not use any lenses to image. So what this does is it lets you image over a very wide field of view so that uh, the field of view is almost 20 to 30 times compared to a conventional microscope. So yeah, I'm looking I look forward to talking to all of you guys and exchanging different ideas. Um, and so let me ping pong to the next person. I guess Joyati Day.",

Yeah, I think yeah, I think uh, even though we work on so my life we've been working on label free microscopy for a while, but uh, the truth is, you know, we have been working towards the hybrid label free and labels uh, more recently. That's something that we feel probably even more exciting. For example, uh, for example, you know, in my own community, you know, Rama microscopy, most of people in the Rama microscopy have been working on label free imaging because uh, you know, that's one of the selling point of Rama that you don't need a fluorescent labels, you're just using the chemical bond, you can uh, extract information. But the truth is, if you actually could deliver some, you know, cleverly designed labels, you actually could, you know, gain even more information or even uh, new information that are beyond the fluorescence. So just give you one example, uh, we use heavy water because heavy water, you know, all the cells, tissues and animals use heavy water as a not only as a chemical not only as a solvent but actually also as a chemical reagent for a lot of synthetic activities. Since like protein synthesis, DNA synthesis all requires water. So if you dilute water into a heavy water, the deuterium bond will actually participate in all the synthetic pathways and eventually will end up in the biological molecules. And uh, and the carbon deuterium bond is well known to be Rama active. So we use that as a reporter or sensor depending how you call it, uh, to look at, you know, synthetic activities of cells, tissues or even animals and we can extract all those metabolic activity information.",

So how can you filter those out in a clever way um for instance getting rid of background signals um and there for instance there are some studies that use uh nanoparticles that are up converting. So for instance you excite them with infrared light which can go deeper into the tissue and they emit fluorescent light.

You know like the small angle scatter resides in the first harmonic and the you know the uh the baseline has the small long angle scatter. So there are lots of methodologies as you know that to remove scatter and we have been very successful with for thicknesses as thick as a breast. Okay, so like you can clear uh a lot of that.
