You know, fermentation can mean a lot of different things. Um, there's a very specific kind of definition about anaerobic fermentation, no oxygen around. And so in order to extract energy from things, you sort of end up making ethanol or you end up making lactic acid, say in muscle or things like that. But then we also know there's fermentation, there's all kinds of foods that you you allow them to ferment, whatever that means, uh that that makes them stable, sterile over time, things like that, kimchi, you know, all kinds of great things like that. And those are supposed to have uh uh some kind of neurological or mental health benefit as well. And there's a whole gamish of things that are being produced in those. So you have this wide range of things. I I I think microbial fermentation really just sort of means um some kind of biochemical transformation that occurs without oxygen, something like that. Emily, you're probably much more of a chemist than I am. Um, what would you what would you say to add to that?",

I mean, we could start off by just simple um you know, uh statistical approaches. I'm sure many of you have heard principle component analysis and all that is is just like takes a high dimensional data space, reduces it down to like, you know, how small tractable number like 10 or so, most most of the time two or three. Um and these components which they're called Latin variables, they're all independent of each other or you know, based on math, they're they're independent of each other. So basically are those and then if you look at those principle components, which are just a function of all these, you know, um different types of metabolites, maybe do those map in regards to linking to like a phenotype or a disease or a clinical endpoint. I mean, there's many ways to do this from a, you know, from a bioinformatic standpoint, but you know, more of the wet lab, the bench standpoint, like for example, cellular tissue organism models, mouse models, etc. And I think Robin mentioned",

The question is what what's the most appropriate readout? Like, for instance, with neurons, are you looking for neuronal activity? Are you looking for secretion of a particular cytokine or growth factor? Are you looking for a switch in the metabolic state? And so, you know, the first one, the activity readout is scalable, so you can do that high throughput. But if you're looking for a global switch in the metabolic state, that's not scalable, right? So maybe you can start with some scalable readouts, you have 100 candidates, narrow that down to five, and then for those five, look at how those five affect the metabolic shift in the neurons. And then from there, test them on mouse models. So like a sequential study with different degrees of complexity.",

And I didn't know if the degeneration would also be present in the enteric nervous system, which would make those sort of difficult to grow. Because, for example, we've tried growing colonic organoids from aged mice, like 24-month old mice, and they just don't grow because I think they're senescent, themselves just aren't as active anymore. So I was just, I guess, wondering about the how viable it is to try to harvest and grow these enteric organoids from.",

            "transcript": "Yeah. So the other issue with ICing them from primary tissue is their, the fully differentiated neurons don't survive the processing. So you enrich for progenitors and glia. So there's a little bit of a sampling error there too. And so when you're dealing with disease versus normal, would that sampling error be different in your disease versus wild type and would that interfere with your readout? So always a concern. But yeah, I mean, we can potentially, if you're starting from stem cells, you can put your Parkinson's mutation in your undifferentiated cells and then generate your neurons from that background and see if that mutation then affects the viability or the function of the neurons in any specific way.",
