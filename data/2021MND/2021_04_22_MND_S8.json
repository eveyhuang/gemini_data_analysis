Certain things, right, you know, blood pressure could be an indicator for stroke too, right? And you know, and so how many, how many data points do you need to resolve a disease state, um, and you know, in terms of bacteria, in terms of, you know, if you're designing sensors, right? How many uh inputs do you need? And that makes, you know, you know, in my world in synthetic biology that makes your cellular circuit much more complex when you have more than one input, right? So, um, you know, the things I would be interested in are the most orthogonal, uh, you know, now, that's a big ask, right? Um, but uh, and also detectable in the physiological range, right? So that's all I need. Um, but uh, I think it's something to consider when you're kind of thinking about the importance of these. Like for example, like butyrate, I mean, has lots of different impacts on all kinds of things. There's inflammation, there's as Bob mentioned the carbon source for uh colonocytes, right? So I feel like when you're thinking for me personally, when I'm thinking about biomarkers, I'm thinking about things that are a lot more specific to particular disease states. Um, but that's just my own interest, that's where I'm coming from.",

So there's a method called Mendelian randomization, basically to use genetic variants from human host genetic variants that can control that biomarker and use that as a drug. Like you use that genetic variant, you treat the metabolite and then you see if there's an impact on the disease. So using genetic data, there's a possibility to test the possible causal relationship between one microbial biomarker and the disease. If we think about a bold suggestion is that we have many possible microbial biomarkers. We can use that same approach and then screen through them to find the metabolite that are likely to be causal for a specific disease. Try to prioritize biomarkers for disease. That's what we do recently in the lab for COVID-19. We go across a few thousand traits including biomarkers and identify the ones that are likely to be causal, increasing people's risk for severe COVID-19. I feel that we can apply the same approach to prioritize possible causal biomarkers for specific disease. And then we can flip that idea around. If you have a specific biomarker like butyrate, what kind of disease is butyrate relevant with? We start with butyrate, we can screen through any possible disease and prioritize the one that is likely has a causal relationship with butyrate. Okay, so those are just bold idea I have here throwing back out there for discussion.",

But if you can find another marker, it could be a phenotype, it could be a small molecule, it could be a gene that is directly correlated with that thing that's biologically important, that can be used to help you monitor disease, screen for it, detect it, or as a proxy to measure treatment efficacy, that sort of thing.",
