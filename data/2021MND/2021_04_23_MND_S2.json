Um so um I have appointment in chemistry department as well as neuroscience program also affiliated with Department of bioengineering. So the research in my lab we focus on developing nanometer scale uh neurotransmitter sensing probes that can probe the dynamics of neurotransmission with fast response time at the time scale of the occurrence of the neurotransmission. So we also developing uh platforms that can probe different kinds of neurotransmission like chemical transmission as well as electrical transmission. And the third focus is to probe multiple groups of uh small neurotransmitter molecules as well. So for example like in neurodegeneration, it all often like involves more than one kind of neurotransmitter. So yeah, so we are very interested in Alzheimer's disease like neurodegeneration in general. So nice to meet you all.",

Um just a snippet of what we kind of do in the in the intersection of microbiome and neurobiology. We're looking at the role of gut bacteria in causing alpha synuclein aggregation in the gut. We know that alpha so alpha aggregates are involved Parkinson's disease. Those aggregates um there's a lot of evidence suggesting that they originate in the gut before they um end up in the brain and they get there through the Vegas nerve. We're studying the role of dopamine and iron, specifically iron speciation um in the gut um in order to actually um sort of map how how alpha synuclein happens and which bacteria are involved and what the specific chemical environment is. So I'm excited to talk with all of you more.",

We have electrochemical methods and uh colorimetric methods. But that's how we try to do it.

So, so basically if you can have like a fecal sample or a or a sample from the gut, you could, you know, the the idea is that you could using these electrochemical techniques, you could um, you could see what's there and and and to what extent, to like to what extent each microbe is contributing to that community. So, so I guess it would be more interesting more useful in that context, like ex vivo um context. I don't know how that would work in vivo. I mean, there are ways of there there are ways of engineering uh wearables and pills that you can, you know, you can take orally and then uh they have the biosensors incorporated and and they they can sense as they go through the GI tract um and report on what they're sensing. So that's a possibility. I mean, this technology you can you can connect it via Bluetooth with a cell phone, so that could be one thing that could be attempted, but we have we haven't we haven't gotten to that yet.",

So to me it starts out with clean cohorts of patients. Um perhaps you choose a disease that has a fairly well defined early phenotype that you can detect it early. Um so some of what Elizabeth is doing with Alpha for example. Um and and then once you have that disease specific information, I think then you jump into models and you put those things in in mice or in dishes and try to manipulate from there. But as long as the question is directly tying to early stage neurological disease, there's so many caveats with models. I think you have to start with people and then go backwards.

And I think, I mean that's what like the basic science mind thinks about. I mean that's I guess what I used to do in grad school, right? You like break something down and then try to understand it. Now, as a clinician, I think and some of the other um people, I'm sorry, I can't see your names right away, but um we're just talking about, you know, talking from the sort of top like top down. So you take the whole person and what can you detect in the whole person that gives you a biomarker. And I've been thinking about this a lot in autism because I've been doing some neuro imaging work trying to find like a neuro imaging biomarker in autism. I mean first of all, autism is not one thing. I think there's in 10 years we're going to know there's like 15 things we used to call autism and there's genetic autism, there's idiopathic autism, there's blah blah blah, right? But anyways, so you take this top down approach and to me a biomarker is not necessarily one thing, it's a collection of things that's almost like a fingerprint, you know, like the biomarker is a signature that's not that's not one thing you do a lab test for, but you do several tests and the whole profile gives you the biomarker.",

So if we're going to pick Parkinson's, you might take people who have the sleep disordered um that precedes Parkinson's disease and you can start there and perhaps look at gut metabolites, you know, oral metabolite, pick your pick your specimen of interest that you want to compare that to healthy individuals, uh people without that patholo that uh early sign of neurologic pathology. Um and and go from there but human stuff is great for kind of getting a big picture and getting clues as to what direction to go in.

Um, I don't know if you guys have heard about these some student of mine did it for a journal club like super smelling humans who can smell like volatiles produced by people with Parkinson's and certain other neuropathologies. Um, and and dogs too have been trained for many of these things. And I I think about this as well just for uh, I mean this is slightly different tangential, but we study H pylori and some of you may know there's a breath test for that, which is based on bacterial urease production which can break down urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide which can be detected using a breath test and I wonder about those as I mean those are again metabolites but small molecule volatiles that can be I don't know in terms of biomarkers I think are really fascinating too.",

This pathway might involve both the micro intermediate epithelial cell and neuron. So in that case, maybe we can also start from for example, this epithelial cell. Um, what type of receptor they express? Do they somehow have more preference for certain ligand? Again, that ligand might be the product from the micro either protein peptide or metabolite. Um, and then I was looking at the question of our group. Seems like what we we were discussing was a a two-step process. Um, like starting from human patients, that's more like identification of what might be the more relevant biomarker. And then can this knowledge be used to diagnosis or or even treatment. That seems like what uh Star was describing would making uh basically transfer this uh different population of for example fecal samples to the germ free animal and then see whether that actually recapitulate the pathology. And then maybe going back to the to the human uh study to validate or even predict. Um seem seems like this like this like a two two step to to first identify and then um validate and predict.",

Um and so um one of the things that so an example is with Parkinson's. So one of the common models for Parkinson's is overexpression of alpha. I'm sorry I keep coming back to this but it's kind of what grounds me in this conversation. But for that um for that model and I think for other mouse models you're you're accelerating processes that then can also cause inflammation, general stress to a system that I think can modulate what the fingerprint that you're measuring in that system looks like that that has other factors that may not be playing out in a a jungle system where there's like less stress happening.",

I do a lot of um not redox speciation but um or get like which which uh compound speciation type work. So I work at different organometallic compounds. Um and we do a lot of work with um enriched isotope spikes. So we would use um um we would add specific isotopically labeled um metals and then look at how they get transformed. And so that's how you differentiate between uh the the ambient, you know, metals which are really hard to like pick apart uh from from, you know, enriched isotopic spikes that you can generally follow um either they're stable or radioactive depending on which which elements you're working with. So yeah.",

So basically I would say perhaps related to what was the concept we discussed yesterday, right? Like you know, how much oxygen are there. So this oxygen level certainly plays a role for the reducing oxidizing environment. That's like the same for example, like in the environment like for the water if you have this aerobic environment and aerobic environment, you have very different composition of irons. For example, iron 3 plus, right? That happens in oxidizing environment. So so all those matters. I think those eventually comes to the point of um how much oxygen was there, right? I I think one of the conversation I had with one of the mentor yesterday was like, oh, can we measure oxygen down there, right?",
