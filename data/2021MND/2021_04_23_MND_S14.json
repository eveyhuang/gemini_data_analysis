Now I know people are doing that um and people have been doing that for for some time. I think that there's always more to learn. Um, I think some of this literature goes back even a decade or more. Um, and I think a lot of this is based on small molecule detection, right? Um, but people like Jeremy Nicholson even more than a decade ago were measuring molecular outputs from the microbiome in mouse and rat models and and some human systems as well. My understanding and and you know, Kai and I think others may know more is, you know, that one of the bottlenecks um is detection, right? And identification of small molecules.

So again maybe it's the way you set up your experiment that you already have a an output of interest in one group of humans or one group of mice and not another and so you can do sort of combinatorial or use combinatorial approaches, but there were improved ways of saying, you know, in addition measuring molecules, like I believe these molecules are the ones that are most bioactive. Then at least it constrains that that chemical space, right?

And maybe for the immune system as well, right? There's going to be certain functions, you know, that can be transferred and maybe we can understand what the what that what the array is. And then when you talk about small molecules, right? You know, I think that that path it's going to be harder to you know, to understand what is that what is a repertoire of of you know, physiological responses. I I agree with you. I mean that that to me is the next like the next step, right? I mean, you know, because ultimately something activates that physiological response, right? And and and then maybe putting this together is that, you know, the the chemical and this is intuitive, but the the chemical um the destination of particular chemicals, for example, doesn't have to be the brain, right? In fact, it's probably hard to get it, but it could be an enteric neuron or or some other cell in the gut that then once you've, you know, sort of you know, you're on the on ramp to the freeway and and and you can, you know, access that, you know, these these connections then the host does the reps, right?

And that could you know, that gets into the bloodstream and it could either diffuse, you know, and you know, go to other organ systems or it even could act locally on vagal neurons, which all have serotonin receptors. And so I think it's just complicated by the fact that all of these pathways are co-occurring at the same time that you have prob neuronal acting going on at the same time as diffusion of serotonin and other serotonin related derivatives um and it's kind of difficult to account for the complexity of these happening in tandem.",

It really makes me wonder if there's more actually diversity in the sensory signals that are going in and actually less communication back um down through that path.

And what's also interesting is that they were different. There was very little overlap in terms of of what those changes actually look like. And so I think that's one example um where again, we were able to specifically activate cells in the ENS because we use these AAVs that Viviana develops which only target which don't even go into the brain, right? use specific promoters um to drive them in neurons and then we use either TH creamice or chat creamice so expression in those specific subsets of neurons. So it's pretty specific. So we don't, you know, we really don't believe that any signals are coming from the brain.",

Maybe those are systems that are primed to really try and understand the directionality of that signal, how those two, you know, locations, right? Not just tissues, you know, are are communicating with each other because at least in, you know, at face value both seem to be affected, right?

Um, but something's also going on in in in the intestines because you can measure measure diarrhea, right? Or at least bloating and and and abdominal pain.

Um, and the idea was at least initially that it was chemicals released from the brain in response to stress, presumably anxiety would be similar yet different mechanisms, but that that would cause increased ion transport, it would affect the the transporters on the epithelial cells cause water influx into the gut. Uh and then impact the tight junctions and that this was transient. So it was temporary for an acute stress and it was more permanent with a chronic stress. Um, and things like corticosterone increase rapidly with the stressor and then they kind of flat line. So if you're going to do chronic stress, you'll still get activation but it's much slower and then that's associated with immune responses, um inflammation, damage, all those things. So there's and then that is associated with a dysbiosis. So acute responses to stress or anxiety are not associated with immuno immune activation and and microbiome changes. Those are more chronic. Um, but we studied most of those using using chambers and things like that. I don't know if that really answers the question, but",
