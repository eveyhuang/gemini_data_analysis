So I know I personally don't work on energy for catalysis, but I know there are a lot of computational works that are starting from the first principle calculations and then coupling them with AI to really screen a bunch of different transition metal chalcogenides and chalcogenates to see how they interact with hydrogen and oxygen, very simple molecules to um for energy, for hydrogen evolution reaction or you know, basically for catalysis, you know, catalyzing those reactions. And then AI coupled with first principle calculations identify what are the type of defects or what transition metals that can actually be thermodynamic stable to make them and they are good to um for that application. And so then they guide the experimentalist that you know, don't build your material, molydenum disulfide for example with manganese. It is good, it is it is good for HER process for this catalytic process. And there has been a lot of discoveries actually that are like um again, I I I think in terms of the super conductivity that's also the same. They were actually started with computational results and they predicted that this is going to be like with a 1.1 degree for example you are going to get super conductivity. It started with and then people could do it. So you just focus on it.",

I'll take the example of uh you know, gut microbiome data that people are looking into. So there are ways to do some type of permutation analysis, an over analysis. There's various statistical ways to kind of see what variance in particular microbial contributes most to uh the the clinical end point you have in mind. So let's say you have uh I'll just go back to my point earlier. Let's say you have like a thousand microbes. Yeah, you could kind of bin them down to particular principle components. Um which I'm sure many in the audience are familiar with that. And then see which principle components um correlates the most with uh with the clinical phenotype that you have.
