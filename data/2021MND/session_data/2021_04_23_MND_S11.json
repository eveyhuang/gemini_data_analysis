Um and the idea was at least initially that it was chemicals released from the brain in response to stress, presumably anxiety with the similar yet different mechanisms, but that that would cause increased ion transport, it would affect the the transporters on the epithelial cells, cause water efflux into the gut uh and then impact the tight junctions and that this was transient. So it was temporary for an acute stress and it was more permanent with the chronic stress. Um and things like corticosterone increase rapidly with the stressor and then they kind of flat line. So if you're going to do chronic stress, you'll still get activation but it's much lower and then that's associated with immune responses, um inflammation, damage, all those things. So there's and then that is associated with a dysbiosis. So acute responses to stress or anxiety are not associated with immuno immune activation and and microbiome changes. Those are more chronic. Um we studied most of those using using chambers and things like that. I don't know if that really answers the question but",
