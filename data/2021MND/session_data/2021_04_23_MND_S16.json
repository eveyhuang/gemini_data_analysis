Um but the questions are, um are there multiomic approaches that can be used beyond correlation to better leverage the massive data collection efforts of genomics, epigenomics, metagenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, etc. Um so what are the what are the approaches beyond correlation? Uh what data must be part of a repository, molecular, cellular, imaging, genomic, metagenomic, clinical measures, etc. And how can it be integrated effectively to track gut brain interactions? So what are the integration methods? And um finally, what tools are available to mine these high dimensional data sets including longitudinal data to follow both bacterial populations and neural populations simultaneously and what needs to be uh developed? So the last one is about um tools that are available or maybe we can imagine tools and and think big. What are what what could we design?

So from the circulating DNA, we can infer um tissue of origin and um specifically looking using single cell reference maps of methylation and uh uh so you can infer if there compared to the control level background, is there elevated level of say brain cells or or OPC cells or or etc. That's in your circulating blood that's beyond the normal turnover.

Then uh but I feel like uh and this was sort of mentioned earlier just even about the data, Stephanie mentioned this, the data and a data set, you might focus on one metabolic pathway and ignore the other 10,000 molecules that you might have collected information on. But it's even compounded by the fact that if you take a stool sample and what you're interested in or what you're interested in measuring are the metagenomes, there's so much other stuff in that stool that could be used, maybe you don't know how to use it, maybe it's not part of your current study, but if you talk to someone who studies immune markers in stool, they could give you some idea of how could you preserve the stuff that you would be normally chucking in the garbage and put it in the freezer that they if they could, you know, um find the funding to do it.",

Um and and we for for for sequencing we only need something like 100 nanograms uh from the ethanol containing tube. So, uh but we preserve uh some of them are you know mark for proteomics but even though we're not really doing that right now, um some of them are you know mark for um metabolomics uh from fecal metabol not just the serum metabol which I'm more interested in. Um and and and also for future experiments where you can that's from the dry tube you can sort of free, you know, culture potentially populated um to to to to do the experiments but even though we haven't we really just use like you know, I guess uh 1/10th of the sample that we have collected so far.

Um, things like treatment, uh immune modulating treatment in particular for for for disease that's involved the immune system such as multiple sclerosis profoundly affects the the gut microbiome. Uh there there are multiple studies that show that so even though when we study disease, uh microbiome in in autoimmune diseases in in neuroinflammatory diseases, um almost all the patients are on some sort of treatment. And and accounting for just what they are being treated may not be adequate because people were treated with different medications at different time point that may have longer term impact. Um, I think these are all major challenges. Um, but but going back to another question that was saying earlier, because these treatments are important, um, so so it's so important perturbations, they they um, they will we expect them to have a greater impact. you can think of them as sort of the natural experiment that has already taken place.

So, um they have developed some interesting methods, for example, the so called similarity network diffusion method. And the basic idea is very simple. If you look at each single omics data type, um you can construct a so called patient similarity network. It's based on correlation, I agree, but let let's let's assume we just use correlation. So you construct a patient similarity network based on any single omics data type. And then you do the fusion and this is the magic moment. You fuse all the single network into a big integrated patient similarity network. And from there, then you can study different types of problem, for example, uh the disease subtyping or patient stratification or do some prediction.

            "transcript": "Single cause at the beginning, everything else is correlated. And I I want to propose one idea uh from human genetics. And right now the method is claimed to be able to infer causal relationship. And the idea is that uh for example, if you LDL cholesterol is positively correlated with heart disease and a lot of studies find that, but it could be confounded by many factors. Imagine that there's a genetic variant that can increase LDL and it's it's a causal variant, we know that. Some individual will carry that variant. Some individual will carry the reference allele. It's like a randomized trial, assign the treatment placebo randomly to different individuals. You follow them for a lifetime, and then you see for those that carry the variant, they have they have higher LDL by definition. Do they tend to have higher risk of heart disease? And putting that kind of information together can help us infer if LDL is causal for heart disease. And this has been published. And also HDL, the good cholesterol, using the same method has been shown that it is not causally uh leading to heart disease. Genetic variant increase HDL do not associate with lower risk of heart disease. So that is is is a method called Mendelian randomization. And very recently in 2019, there's a nature genetic paper that study the causal relationship of uh microbiome uh short chain and then a metabolic trait, type two diabetes. They study the effect of uh butyrate on obesity and type two diabetes using that approach. And if you guys accept that approach, then we can leverage a lot of the existing data set. You only need a G for a metabolite. And then you need G for the outcome, for the disease. Putting those information together in a statistical network can help you infer if that metabolite is causal for the outcome. Uh and we have a lot of data out there for metabolite. We have less data for microbiome because G for microbiome mostly is small data set, so it's not that reliable. But if we look at butyrate, acetate, we we have large G for them. For example, in UK Biobank, they have 200,000 participants with those uh biomarker. So I think there's a lot of opportunity using that method if you believe that it is causal. But I I I personally feel that at least it's one step forward towards causal, better than correlation. That's that's my idea.",

It's interesting to hear what your perspective is. All the sessions I've been part of um it's it's always interesting to hear what the group what direction they go with it. Um we hardly ever talked about uh gut brain axis or anything to do that. This was sort of a high level discussion about big data sets and and and how you deal with things. Um certainly one of the things that the I'll just put this out there just so that uh uh it it's in people's minds. It's not necessarily something that uh is right or or better than than what we're doing but uh certainly one of the things that multi omix data sets sort of the hot area that is now are making these tissue atlases for example. So if you look at the enteric nervous system um and you make a multi omic data set there, you can divide it or or the goal is to divide it into what are actually the different tissue types that are there based on some kind of multi omic profile of of individual cells or groups of cells and then how does that what what what anatomical location is that within the GI tract, what what microbes are likely to be in that area. It's very different uh uh at the at the top of the small intestine than it is down at the bottom of the colon. Uh you know, those kind of those kinds of questions about how the gut can communicate with the brain through the enteric nervous system and how you use multi. There's a whole dimension that I don't think we touched on there and um when you're thinking about your your two and three person projects, just remember the goal here is to be bold and you know, try to do something uh highly impactful uh but but manageable, not not completely over the top. And and um I think our discussion was very good but it was kind of high level and and you might think of some of these other kind of methods driven uh approaches to how multi omics is going to uh allow us to understand the connection between the microbiome, whether it's in the gut or any other tissue and the brain. Um oral microbiome is pretty interesting as well because your mouth is much closer to your brain than your gut is and so uh the possibility for communication there is quite different. So anyway, I just throw out a few thoughts for everybody as you as you make your as you pair off or or or break in the threes uh however you're doing it to think of your projects.",
