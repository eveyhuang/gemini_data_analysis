And you know, and so how many, how many data points do you need to resolve a disease state, um, and you know, in terms of bacteria, in terms of, you know, if you're designing sensors, right? How many uh inputs do you need? And that makes, you know, you know, in my world in synthetic biology that makes your cellular circuit much more complex when you have more than one input, right? So, um, you know, the things I would be interested in are the most orthogonal, uh, you know, now, that's a big ask, right? Um, but uh, and also detectable in the physiological range, right? So that's all I need. Um, but uh, I think it's something to consider when you're kind of thinking about the importance of these. Like for example, like butyrate, I mean, has lots of different impacts on all kinds of things. There's inflammation, there's as Bob mentioned the carbon source for uh colonocytes, right? So I feel like when you're thinking for me personally, when I'm thinking about biomarkers, I'm thinking about things that are a lot more specific to particular disease states.

And I think that actually makes the problem harder and maybe even further pens you into a space where really the good mark biomarkers and this would be my own bias would be things that may be causal. Um and those would be the things that you would be able to detect actually early before you have the changes in physiology and a lot of the biomarkers that we use that people rely on are the opposite, right?

It was started over 10 years ago when I was in Toronto. But the gem study um was just published in Gastro last year looking at prospective IBD patients and and siblings. And so they designed this study to identify whether intestinal permeability was a predisposing factor to IBD uh in and so there was all these anecdotal evidences that um people had permeability defects prior to getting IBD and this was a designed specifically to address this and so they had um siblings uh of IBD patients and they looked at stool, they looked at biopsies and all these things and were able to identify permeability as a as a precursor to IBD in a genetically susceptible population. Um and I know that they collected all the stool and they haven't analyzed it yet, but that might be one way to look at biomarkers um for people that over time developed IBD. And so I'm not sure if a similar study could be designed with a specific neurodegenerative disease in mind where there is an genetic or environmental component that can be identified prior to onset. And then following although some of these the the process is a lot longer because the disease develops later in life compared to IBD, but it's just an example of something that was could be designed in order to get biomarkers prior to and then during. And then I just had a quick question about with CSF a potential fluid that could be used to look at a more direct location for biomarkers um in in neurodegenerative diseases. I'm not familiar enough to know.",

So when I'm thinking about like a causal mechanism and trying to figure out a biomarker in that pathway, then the kind of matrices I would be interested in for for me would be saliva, any any kind of tissue that would get at the oral microbiome. And it it depends on the mechanism. So probably blood and then CSF. Like those are the three kind of um major things that I feel like could track an inflan an inflammation mechanism or even a translocation mechanism that I would be able to pick up on something.",

And so that presents a challenge but also an opportunity to set up systems that will fund research that can really span an entire lifetime and um and and also here, you know, the study design becomes really important of course because you you want to be uh following people for a really long time so that some of these microbiota effects can become uh evident.

So, um, when we analyze the a metabolome, we might have a decent idea of the identities of 5% of the features that we can detect in a sample. But that doesn't stop us. We're not going to only focus on the 5% we can name. We take all of those features and we look for, do these, which of these features correlate with disease? And then the next step is, beyond correlation, which of these features predict disease in a new cohort? If they check out, then we'll do the work to find out what that feature is. But even if we never know what it is, we can describe it. We can say under these conditions, we're going to see it with this mass at this set of retention times and that's still information. Um, so it's just like knowing a gene sequence even though you don't know what that gene does. You don't have to know what the metabolite is for it to be a predictive biomarker so long as you can reliably measure it and you know from sample to sample, this mystery factor X, I know where it's at, I can pick it out and I can measure it.

So it will be useful to do the metabolomics of the blood sample or maybe other human sample, overlap those like uh microbial metabolomic and and blood metabolomics and then focus on those that overlap with the the tools suggesting that microbial metabolite can enter bloodstream and potentially.

Uh so there's a method called Mendelian randomization, basically to use genetic variants uh from from human, host genetic variants that can control that uh biomarker and use that as a as a drug. Like you use that genetic variant, you treat the metabolite and then you see if there's an impact on the disease. So using genetic data, there's a possibility to test the possible causal relationship between one microbial biomarker and the the disease. And you you think about it uh a bold suggestion is that we have many possible microbial micro uh biomarkers. We can use that same approach and then screen through them to find the metabolite that are likely to be causal for a specific disease. Right? Try to prioritize biomarkers for disease. And that's what we do recently in the lab for COVID-19. We go across a few thousand traits including biomarkers and identify the ones that are likely to be causal increasing people's risk for severe COVID-19. And I feel that we can apply the same approach to prioritize possible causal biomarker for a specific disease. And then we can flip that idea around. If you have a specific biomarker like bute, what kind of disease is is bute relevant with? We start with bute, we can screen through any possible disease and prioritize the one that is likely has a causal relationship with uh bute. Okay?

So it may be difficult to directly measure something like um a particular short chain fatty acid, um either because it's short lived, like it's produced and then it's taken up and biotransformed and so it's hard to measure certain things in real time. Um, but if you can find another marker, it could be a phenotype, it could be a small molecule, it could be a gene that is directly correlated with that thing that's biologically important, that can be used to help you monitor disease, screen for it, detect it, um or as a a proxy to uh to measure treatment efficacy, that sort of thing.",
