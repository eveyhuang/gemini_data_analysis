And so in order to extract energy from things, you sort of end up making ethanol or you end up making lactic acid, say in muscle or things like that. But then we also know there's fermentation, there's all kinds of foods that you you allow them to ferment, whatever that means, uh that that makes them stable, sterile over time, things like that, kimchi, you know, all kinds of great things like that. And those are supposed to have uh uh some kind of neurological or mental health benefit as well. And there's a whole gamish of things that are being produced in those. So you have this wide range of things. I I I think microbial fermentation really just sort of means um some kind of biochemical transformation that occurs without oxygen, something like that.

I mean, we could start off by just simple um you know, uh statistical approaches. I'm sure many of you have heard principle component analysis and all that is is just like takes a high dimensional data space, reduces it down to like, you know, how small tractable number like 10 or so, most most of the time two or three. Um and these components which they're called Latin variables, they're all independent of each other or you know, based on math, they're they're independent of each other. So basically are those and then if you look at those principle components, which are just a function of all these, you know, um different types of metabolites, maybe do those map in regards to linking to like a phenotype or a disease or a clinical endpoint. I mean, there's many ways to do this from a, you know, from a bioinformatic standpoint, but you know, more of the wet lab, the bench standpoint, like for example, cellular tissue organism models, mouse models, etc. And I think Robin mentioned",

What is the actual state that we want to induce? And do all these chemicals and all these, you know, functions actually matter towards getting us closer to that that endpoint of normal brain activity? I don't know how you define normal, but healthy brain activity, you know?
