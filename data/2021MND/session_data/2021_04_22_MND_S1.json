Uh, so given that the short chain fatty acids we talk we heard Bob tell us about and also the serotonins and the hormones that we just are talking about, we can study how they enter the epithelial cells or how they are secreted uh across and how they transport across the membranes or through the epithelial layers which will contribute to the communication part of this question. Uh, how does the communication happen? But is are the molecules small enough or the metabolites small enough to just penetrate through the cell membrane versus the receptors. And question is that, you know, if you knock off the receptors, does the communication still happen? So identifying part of it is not my expertise, but if given the data that these are the metabolites that are found, uh, we can talk about the communication part of it because there is enough uh details available now about the epithilia of the gut uh and also the bacterial membrane itself and the bacterial porins that really transport the metabolite in and out of the material cell also. So sort of you know the walls of the two uh, you know, the the epithelial cells and the bacterial cells and the the if you know the metabolites then the communication piece of it, how that is happening can be model at a molecular level at the atomistic level. And that can provide a lot of information. The other piece that is now growing that if we have a body of data that given these are the microbial species in a in the gut and the associated metabolites, there is uh this whole uh new computational tool of big data where we can start putting together that, you know, what is the correlation between having a list of bacteria and having the metabolites and what is that correlation? Uh, and just to sort of to give you an example like, you know, when we buy stuff on Amazon,",

And there has been a lot of uh discoveries actually that way. Um, like um again, I I like in terms of like super conductivity, that's also the same. They were actually started with computational works that they predicted that this is going to be like with this given like just a specific angle. Like if you have two graphene sheets, if you rotate them by 1.1 degree, for example, you are going to get super conductivity. It started with theory, but then people try to do that because you know, think about it. How many different angles can we really try? And we are talking about 1.1 degree. It's it was so specific and actually then people could do it. They just focus on it, finally people one group could get it and it worked. Uh so it seems to be in some sense similar. Meaning we have really the see ocean of different things that could be of um, you know, could be the biomarkers and the only way that could work is machine, AI, which can tell us what are potential biomarkers. And perhaps AI and all these big genomics omics data, they can narrow down. Maybe they are doing it. I'm not the expert in that field. So maybe there is already there, so um, so we we know uh some uh you know, we have some answers, but I I'm not in that field, so I don't know.

Um, I guess the thing, the thing that I keep coming back to and I think always comes up in these types of conversations is, so for the things that we know about, for the metabolites we know about, like glutamate, short chain fatty acids, right, we have ways to detect those already. What I'm particularly interested in is like what other metabolites, what other small molecules are important that we're missing because they end up in that like, you know, if you've seen a metabolomics data set, like half of it is unknown, one unknown to unknown 300. And those can be, you know, the most significant ones based on whatever analysis you're running, but if it's an unknown, you're kind of stuck. The same is true for hypothetical genes in in a metagenomics data set. Um, the techniques are are getting better to get annotation and to ascribe um particular genes to a particular organism, but I'm still not sure how you can pick that out of the complex community De novo. So what I keep wrestling with is is there a way to use some kind of maybe big data approach to identify those unknowns that are really important that you can then maybe use some computational spectra analysis machine learning to try to predict what that metabolite might be. Um that's all out of my realm of expertise, but the unknown problem is really tricky.",

But then you also have what can be potentially be important effects on immune cells which circulate and affect the rest of the body. You could potentially have effects on nerve endings with neurotransmitters that are in the enteric nervous system and have impact on this.

I don't know how much that is feasible, but what then we can do is a correlation that introduction of these particular two species, one species, whatever bacteria resulted in these metabolites.

So I'm wondering whether some value could be derived from thinking about it more from a network perspective instead of a list of things perspective one and two whether tracking uh the development in in in individuals uh over time uh to kind of map out the space of configurations uh that form that ecosystem uh and understand how external perturbations perhaps modulate it because ultimately it seems the complexity is so big it might make sense to to understand the the constraints uh and I'm just thinking if we compare across individuals or you know groups of one type versus another uh we'll we'll we'll never have enough statistical power to understand what's going on and if we should shift back almost like to individual cases and see how things develop there.
