Only one is model and that's called as capnocytophaga. Okay? Now, that doesn't mean that that one model bacteria is not important because that one is found in all human samples that we get and is like the second or the third most abundant bacteria. Okay? And we find that this model bacteria helps shape the structure of a microbial community essentially, okay? So you don't need all of them to be model.

Um might be one way to start to get a handle on this because I guess from what I'm what I'm gathering from the conversation is there are just so many different types of stress, so many different types of stress response that we're thinking about that we need to kind of start to define, okay, which ones do we want to look at, how do we look at them? Um which is all its own kind of question, like how do you define which which stress is the most important on a microbe.

Um there must be a kind of sensor proteins or in the bacteria and that can sense the stress and then has a like intracellular signaling pathway, often times is a activation of transcription factors. So I feel these actually can be studied um in individual that in a really simple model model case. Of course um in I guess in the gut there's still much more complications.

Um, and I think the points that have been made now by Chris and Carolina and others about like the need for genetic tools are very good. Um, in the absence of those, we might have to think about more global interventions, um, with small molecules or things. Again, it depends on the type of stress and it's taking kind of a sledgehammer approach because it's not a very precise mechanism, but if you're thinking about pH stress or oxidative stress, are there small molecule modulators, um, you know, I previously worked with vibrio cholera a lot and for a lot of those animal models, the way you get them to work is to dose the rabbit with an antacid to enable a relaxation of the bottleneck of the stomach so you get reliable colonization of the intestine. So are there things like that that can address major bottlenecks in the host that affect microbial growth and colonization. It's just an idea.",

So we just don't know what sort of antibiotic resistant profiles certain bacteria have once we have to grow them in the lab to do all of that and then we have to figure out which plasma can go in and which plasma for integrate and things like that.
