I'm interested in understanding how the nervous system gets wired up in the beginning. Um, and until a very few years ago, what developmental biologists knew was it's mom's genes and then it's your genes, at least when you're talking about vertebrates. And now we suddenly know that there are all these other associated microbes with many, many more genes that are influencing the process from very early stages of development. And, uh, you know, it's it's cast a whole new light on the developmental process, and I'm someone who believes that the developmental process sets the organism up for the kinds of things that are going to happen later, such as the kinds of things that that, uh, Bob has talked about. And so we're, uh, in my lab also interested in interactions between the microbiome and other tissues, um, uh, and the nervous system. So in the gut, we look a lot at immune cells in the gut, and in the brain, we look at microglia, which are the resident immune cells in the brain. I don't know the best way for people to introduce themselves because we probably all have, uh, each other in different places on our screens. So people could volunteer, and if they don't, uh, maybe we'll start calling on them.",

Uh, we use, uh, the all kinds of therapeutic approach targeting mitochondria to, uh, to see if this is a, uh, the useful target for, uh, preventing the course of neurodegeneration. Uh, recently, we started to look at the the role of mitochondria in the, uh, gut and the brain access, especially in the context of Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease. We try to understand, uh, we want to test the hypothesis that if mitochondria in the gut system could actually serve as like ancient bacteria and they communicate with the immune system, which actually released the factors and, uh, the message to the brain and and also trigger we to trigger the neuroinflammation in brain. Uh, this is our hypothesis. We also start to look build up the model system to work on this, uh, big questions. Yeah.",

Um, as a part of this process, uh, you know, we started to realize that we're having a lot of difficulty with, uh, both, uh, reproducibility and, you know, the rigor of a lot of the experiments that are out there. And we actually stumbled upon the fact that, uh, we're learning that the different gut microbial populations are really driving a lot of unexpected and unanticipated changes in the quantitative microstructure in the brain that we're all using. And so now, uh, the lab has taken a hard left turn and now we're really starting to examine how, uh, the gut microbiome is really influencing, uh, neural structural, neural functions. We're using both PET and MR technologies. Um, and really trying to basically reverse engineer imaging and try to figure out how, uh, these sort of genetic and environmental factors are driving the the factors that we're seeing, uh, in translational medical imaging.",

And again, at least with Parkinson's disease, there's a a plethora now of of samples. So on the order of thousands, I think now that have been sequenced pretty deeply. So we can see not just associations and the presence or absence of particular microbes, but actually enrichments and correlations with different aspects of disease severity, uh, things like the constipation phenotypes that happen in in these patient populations. Um, things like severity of the motor symptoms, uh, rapid. We don't quite have progression yet. Um, you know, PD is is a pretty long disorder that takes a long time to progress. So to my knowledge, we don't have that sort of temporal resolution.",

So we, you know, with, you know, our quantitative neuroimaging techniques, we can generate basically omics level type of data sets. And what we actually do then is we take, uh, 16S, uh, metagenomic data and using a lot of, uh, ML and DL type approaches, um, we basically look for statistical associations between, uh, microstructural changes occur in the brain and the sort of the frequency and prevalence of certain microbes that are in the gut. So whereas Tim is actually sort of, you know, I kind of think of it as like a bottom up approach, takes like the actual clinical sample and then tests it out and see what are what's associated with, uh, any of the other sort of output measures. Uh, we're going sort of backwards and I can find statistical associations. And I think there's, you know, benefits for both. Um, particularly for this, uh, this breakout session and I guess sort of just like this pie in the sky pitch that I've always had. Uh, so this is a potential project maybe is, um, since we're all sort of interested in neuroinflammation and ostensibly many of us are also interested in microglia. Um, you know, there's been some really good research coming out of like UCSF where they've taken plasma from, you know, aged patients and doing plasma transfers into young patients and backwards and forwards showing that you can rescue a lot of these aging phenotypes. And I would love to do the same thing with different microbial populations like in notobiotic mice, taking those plasma from those mice and in like, you know, a microfluidics or like a multiplex way look at how, you know, different plasma metabolites alter micro morphology, single cell seek, those types of things to really get at whether or not it's the metabolites that are driving it or is it the presence of gut microbiota or is it something in between that's really driving these neuroinflammatory changes that we're all seeing in the brain.",

We call it like topic immune expression. And then there's some there's this is already out um that in a high fat diet or during obesity the the neurons look like fat cells um where they're um have more leptin and they respond to more more more like um um metabolic um signatures in the gut. So yeah, and the cool thing about these sensory neurons in the periphery is that they they can they can do this because they're, you know, they're outside of the blood brain barrier and they're able to be influenced by the by stimulus outside stimuli outside of the the brain.",

And I know it's possible for um peripheral monocytes to make their way into the brain themselves, um and then communicate with microa. Um, and microa can um express whatever proteins they want to to get out into the the the periphery as well.
