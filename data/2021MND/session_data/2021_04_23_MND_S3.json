I'm starting my third year here in the Department of Physiology and about to get moved to a different department of cell biology in a couple months. Um, my lab is interested in understanding functional contributions of gut microbes and neurodegenerative outcomes. So we use mouse models of Parkinson's disease, uh as well as um starting to dabble in some Alzheimer's disease work. And we've recently become interested in how the gut microbiome responds after traumatic uh brain injury or spinal cord injury. Uh and looking at how different microbes may be potentiating or uh inhibiting recovery in the gut nervous system after these uh traumatic events. And so hoping to identify potential neurogenic factors that are derived from the gut microbiome to promote recovery after these injuries.",

So we can see not just associations and the presence or absence of particular microbes, but actually enrichments and correlations with different aspects of disease severity, uh things like the constipation phenotypes that happen in in these patient populations. Um, things like severity of the motor symptoms, uh rapid we don't quite have progression yet. Um, you know, PD is is a pretty long disorder that takes a long time to progress. So to my knowledge, we don't have that sort of temporal resolution, but we do have sort of that um cross-sectional uh resolution of of disease severity.",

However, uh, the gut microbiome or the stress from gut actually may form the inflammatory stress that actually track back to the brain which actually further uh stimulate alpha synuclein aggregation or toxicity. That is what we thought. Uh, so we are still uh working on this part and say uh how the what to what extent the gut microbiome or the mitochondria in the gut uh gut system could actually enhance the alpha synuclein pathology in brain. Uh, so we do see something but I I always say this is all be all about the combination. It's not like we cannot say the gut could be the the the damage or stress from gut is causal. We cannot say that. We just say this could actually enhance or promote the later neurodegeneration.

So the um the interesting thing about um the innervation of the gut is that that it's there there's multiple different kinds of of systems that are there, the inter nervous system, the vagus system and also uh just sensory neurons from the DRGs. But um they all have similar uh functionality in the context of the types of receptors they express and for for a while the idea that there is these this atypical expression pattern of of of um things like kind receptors and other receptors that actually physically and directly bind to microbes themselves um to facilitate um to facilitate an output or physiology is is is a fairly new concept like maybe within the past five to six years. And so uh when you talk about neuroinflammation, I know we've been talking a lot about the brain but really in the context in the periphery and locally at the site within the gut, there's quite a bit of neuroinflammation and control. And so these what they what they do, right is um they express and also and the and the purpose for for those are to recruit uh immune cells to a particular site to help uh mediate if something's out of you know if there's too many microbes of one kind or another. Um, so the the neurons sense what's happening and and bring more immune cells to the site and thereby directly mediating neuroinflammation. Um, kind of like a conductor, right? And then uh the the idea of of um how that's what what the signal actually is, what's the or the micro bind to to the a neuron, um they have a representation or electrophysiological representation or activity. Um, something called uh like a neurogram if you will like for a particular or particular microbe, which is one of my ideas actually for a project is are there different um activation signatures um in the Vegas for particular microbes that can give you an idea of what's happening and how the brain is affected downstream and this is in the context of whatever disease state you want to think about PD, AD.
