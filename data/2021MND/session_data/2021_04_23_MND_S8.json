Um, they restore some of the characteristic defects that you see in a germ free animal. So every single one of them has the ability to induce host education, uh immune education, uh homeostasis. So putting them together, like you're just going to hit different parts of whatever immune profile you're you're supposed to be fixing. Um, and then associated with that there's intestinal vascularization, um, and that probably has impacts on gut brain access. So it's a very interesting question of what's right because I don't think anybody knows the answer to that. But each one of them each one of them has a specific niche to fix to sort of educate the immune system and everything that follows downstream of that.",

And also if you think about the technical limitation, what kind of a sequencing technique you want to use so that you can profile the system at each level. So I I think we need to be very pragmatic. So if you only um do 16S RNA gene sequence, maybe you're you're only looking to um the bacteria profile. If you do a whole genome shotgun sequencing, maybe you you can uh you can uh look at both um all kinds of uh different uh micro organisms.

And uh we have we have shown very clear evidence that this will not work. And the idea is very simple. If you just shuffle the time series, you largely destroy the temporal structure and you standard system identification method to infer the interaction, you will get very similar uh interactions. What does this mean? This just mean the real time series is just like a random uh um random shuffle time series. Okay. So that's one approach. As long as you have very informative time series data, you can rely on very standard system identification technique to infer the inter species interaction. But if you don't have time series data, you can still rely on cross section data. As long as you assume the cross section data roughly represent the static samples of the the complex ecosystem and we have developed method to infer the inter species interactions from cross section data. And the basic idea is that as long as you have two static samples, as long as they have uh one common species, then the difference between the two steady states somehow encode the inter species interactions. So in this case, as long as you collect enough static samples, then we can basically infer the inter species interactions. The only caveat is that we need a super abundance. Radical abundance will not work. The combinationality issue is really a big challenge in this uh inter species interaction inference.",

There was something else, Carolina also, um, didn't mention Young. Um, Young mentioned models, um, that he does because he's a physicist and he mentioned that when you do models, um, I'm going to try to summarize it, Young, but please, um, correct me, okay? So he said, there's two things that you could do. You could take transactional data or you could take longitudinal data. And um, you what you have to to know is the real abundance of of the members of the community, not relative abundance, which is one of the limitations of of the field, I would say, because that's some of the information that we have most commonly available, which is relative abundance. Um, but he can craft and model these interactions and come up with a homeostasis regardless of if you have cross-sectional data or longitudinal data, the key is to have real real amounts and not relative abundance. Did I summarize it well, Young, or do you want to add something else? Can we put that as a bullet point also, Carolina?",

So variable technologies and diagnostics by sensors that uh they can do real time monitoring. Uh, so yesterday it was mentioned like uh in some of the groups, I don't remember which one, uh that uh this could be uh like, you know, imagine we have like a smart peel, um, that it can actually monitor different things. Of course, it's not going to be in the level that the genomics or these metabolomics analysis they do, but uh that's could be actually very useful because it is not as specific as all those genomics data are because they are too big. So really to get what is what and where it it comes from, it is going to be, you know, we have a pool of everything basically from what I understand. So having like, you know, more systemic or systemic behavior of here is how the redox changes. Here is how, I don't know, pH changes. Here is how uh growth of the whole population or a specific population uh changes here versus, you know, another location.

You know, at the level even of macro ecology, we don't we have a really tough time predicting what happens if we reintroduce wolves in Yellowstone or if we put that mosquito that it's it doesn't uh transmit malaria, right? That so maybe too hard to do on a personal level or like an on a personalized medicine type of level to understand like how these communities are varying once we add an individual member. But do we actually need to know that level of detail for being predictive about gut brain interactions? And I guess I I I would argue we probably do not need to go at that final level and I can from the perspective of I I would like to be able to tell that level from just for for for the interest of this evolution evolutionary dynamics and ecological dynamics. But I I um and I don't know very much about this field so anyone that please chime in from the perspective of uh the what ends up actually uh going to the brain or being sensed by the brain. I imagine it is more of a a time average uh mixture of metabolites that make it into the serum that then make it into the brain.

It in my opinion, I think it comes from the the uh entirety of the system and I have a lot of doubts as to whether that complexity can be derived ground up because it seems like when you put two players in, you get some very specific interactions that may or may not have any bearing on what you get when you have 100 players.",

But I think whatever your question is allows you to draw the bounds of what what you're what you're including. Um but for a simple example of how the host shapes the environment that the microbes are in, when you introduce a helminth that changes the epithelial mucus production and that's going to have an effect on the physical environment and so how close microbes can get to epithelial cells. And just by changing the glycobiology of the mucus, it changes which microbes can then compete. So it's the host response, not even talking about inflammation, but it's changing the physical environment that those microbes are now interacting in. So I think with all of this, like and I said this in the session that we were in yesterday, these are all really big questions. So whatever we're doing, we're there's going to be a specific question that your research interest is guiding towards and that's going to change or that's going to affect your ideal approach to answering said question. And I think we all have to have like a very agnostic view of this is the the question, this is the approach that they took and now we all have a responsibility to try and synthesize that to give us some information on interspecies interactions and then how that's going to affect gut brain.",

I guess we can start by saying there's top down and down to top, but we can maybe summarize it and um, yeah. I mentioned this yesterday, not today, but I I I believe strongly that microbes react to their environment and they can also change their environment and this makes the question, of course, a more complex one. And so you if you introduce a probiotic, for example, that will go to the gut, but will not graft and not change the environment, nothing really happened, right? But if you somehow manage to change that environment, the microbiota will change. Um, and so, um, I'll I'll give you two examples from my research. One, we did a study where we look at um, the gut microbiota after gastric bypass surgery. And this this was my introduction to the gut microbiome world and um, the changes after gastric bypass surgery are so drastic that with the three patients, we were able to get statistical significance. And you know how hard that is in the microbiome world.",

There's a pH and there's also when you do gastric bypass surgery, you bypass the stomach, which is a filter for microbes, you know, the stomach has a very high pH and it's a filter for microbes. So we also ended up when we repeated this in a longitudinal way, we found an increase of microbes that are microbes normally found in the mouth, which makes sense because now they can go through, right? And they can make it to the gut. Uh, but I am sure the gut environment changed dramatically. Um, and also the substrate as as Lawrence mentioned, uh, the substrate changes because now you bypass the the gastric acid, so the way that the gut is receiving the nutrients is it's a different shape of nutrients.",
