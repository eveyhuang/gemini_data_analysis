There's some beautiful studies that show like the tracking of you know, like pharmacokinetics of drugs, um which we leverage a lot um uh in our lab like going back to use those. When you think about the molecules that are produced endogenously, it does get really tricky to me to think about well even if it's getting produced, where does it go from there? Is it going between cells? Like is it crosses the epithelium is it going through a cell, which could matter in terms of we think a lot about oxidation state. If it goes through a cell, this could change like oxidation state as opposed to between cell. And uh this is something we've struggled with in the lab like thinking about how do you actually track those specific molecules that are getting produced where it's more obvious if it's an exogenous source that you're providing like a carbon, we can use C13 labels too, but how do you do that in vivo um and follow where it goes?

I have to be honest with you for most other sessions I've felt I've been able to follow and it's probably because I came a little late, but um sort of the level of the scientific discussion has been a bit above me, which is in part why I haven't jumped in yet. So it's been part of what I've really enjoyed about the is that I truly have learned so much and like my day-to-day I think looks very different from a lot of you.

Um, but yeah, bacteria do secrete siderophores in uh the the microbiome. The human also secretes enzymes to capture uh iron three, reduce it to iron two so that it can be brought inside of cells. But I think we have a poor understanding of the dynamics of that. Um, how much of the iron is three versus two. I also fascinated that we have that the body it's the iron is so valuable as you know, as we know, for so many processes that there's no way for the body to um, the body doesn't regulate iron levels except for excretion through stool. That's its only way to get like rid of it. Um, and it's um, but we don't understand really the dynamics of what's happening there and um what the the yeah, oxidation states are and how this changes with dysbiosis of a microbiome.

So you know you have a difference, but is the disease state say if it's got a reduced level of short chain fatty acids in the circulation, is that still saturation for that that person? Um, and is there a way that we can overcome that uh or would the way that we deliver said drug, if it's a short chain fatty acid for example, if we just feed that into the diet versus uh changing the microbiota so that we increase short chain fatty acid capability from the from the microbiota itself, does does that have an effect on the pharmacodynamics of the drug's ability or access to a different tissue site. Um, and then finally, this conversation about metal ions, there's a lot that sort of was happening while I was trying to get these notes um together, but it sounded like ultimately really there are indications that the microbiota has something to do with uh heavy metal metabolism. There's a lot that we don't understand and technically we don't we don't understand it because there are so many technical challenges just in terms of measurement, reporting across studies and one thing that could really advance the field here would be sensors for metal content and species uh in vivo in real time and then within that looking for whether or not these heavy metals are acting as electron acceptors or versus enzyme cofactors.

Um, but they're not necessarily associated with the microbiome, but it's at least another thought of maybe we don't even need to understand really what's going on and really just use the microbiome as an agent through which we could engineer the metabolome of the host provided these molecules are, you know, going through inter circulation and that's something.",

And there's another one based in Boston uh called Synlogic. Um these are all in like phase two trials, all orally dosed. I know some folks that worked at Synlogic and their clinical trial was giving people a half a liter of bacterial culture at a concentration of like 10 to the 11 CFU per mill. And that was approved by the FDA. So it's like really high dosing of bugs going into people um and they've had good phase two results I think or phase 1A phase 1B sorry, phase two results and they're moving forward from there. So",
