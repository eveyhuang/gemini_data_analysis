And then AI coupled with first principle calculations identify what are the type of defects or what transition metals that can actually be thermodynamic stable to make them and they are good to um for that application. And so then they guide the experimentalist that you know, don't build your material, molydenum disulfide for example with manganese. It is good, it is it is good for HER process for this catalytic process. And there has been a lot of discoveries actually that are like um again, I I I think in terms of the super conductivity that's also the same. They were actually started with computational results and they predicted that this is going to be like with a 1.1 degree for example you are going to get super conductivity.

And so the the reason I'm here is because I've been interested for a while in thinking about um gut microbiome. What about the other direction? What about the brain to the gut? And so the question that I got from this morning is are those um you know, assets that are being produced are they there to support or are they certain molecules that are there to support a more varied and diverse system? And so the variety of the system is what I'm thinking about. That's really what I am interested in.",

So we did uh we did a K fold uh validation uh random forest supervised learning study. And we're able to show that you know, certain areas of the brain, there was structural change may actually say that's because we had this rosemary and we had this microstructural change over here and that's due to, you know, bifidobacterium in the gut. Which can make those statistical associations between gut microbial populations in the brain. The the problem with that as you know is these are pure statistical associations and actual biology is a little bit opaque. Like why do we see that? So it's hard to validate uh this sort of studies.",

I'll take the example of uh you know, gut microbiome data that people are looking into. So there are ways to do some type of permutation analysis, an over analysis. There's various statistical ways to kind of see what variance in particular microbial contributes most to uh the the clinical end point you have in mind. So let's say you have uh I'll just go back to my point earlier. Let's say you have like a thousand microbes. Yeah, you could kind of bin them down to particular principle components.

Of course those approaches are needed as a standard to compare with.
