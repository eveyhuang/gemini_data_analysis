At the end of the day, carbon will change to different forms. You're putting energy in some form, right? Hybrid means you're turning one form of energy to another one and feeding it to another unit. That's how you can view it. So for example, Betar's technology, if you want to get magnesium from for example magnesium silicon materials, if you need a lot of acid and base. If you can electrochemically make acid and base, there's so many decarbonization you can do. People don't think about it, right? So there are a lot of technologies out there already existing. Just doing bipolar membrane with the electrolysis, you can make huge amount of acid and base and it doesn't seem like it does do anything to carbon decarbonization or negative carbon technology, but like Betar is doing, in a sense that by putting them together, you're moving energy such a way that you can make it net benefit. I think that's what hybrid means in my opinion. Go ahead.",

So you basically want to be able to break down rocks, rocks are cheap and abundant, and then you want to be able to create rocks and then the thermodynamics has to work out and then the CO2 mass balance has to work out, which is the challenge. But what I find really exciting are these processes, you know, natural processes do this actually fairly well, they just do it very slowly and are very site specific and we have many logistical challenges and so on.

So have you seen studies that address this question or do we is there a way or a framework even to discriminate between processes that are truly carbon negative versus those that would necessarily be carbon positive, right?

So you know when Google runs their their server farms, they buy renewable energy to do it. So the idea that you can run these electrochemical processes today on 100% renewable electricity is entirely reasonable. So the idea that you run your calculation as if it was grid electricity is I think just wrong. So that simplifies it a lot. You can assume that your electricity is carbon free and go ahead and do your chemistry.",

            "transcript": "So there was an earlier session had that report out just briefly about carbon negative technology, what does that mean? So you need to see you to the chemicals and fuels, usually the best you can do is carbon neutral. Because when you say carbon negative means that whatever carbon was in the atmosphere, which is a fossil based because we emitted more than we had to, we should have, and then went back into the earth so that there was a net negative direction. That's what negative technology means. If we keep circulating using that carbon above the ground, that's zero, right? So carbon neutral. So the reason a lot of times somehow CO2 utilization got lopsided with the conversion, negativity and all that so that we put it together, but I think it serves a very different role because at the end of the day, like this is not only about long bridge of CCUS, like from now on in the future if you care about climate change and the earth, you should stop using fossil carbon. So I don't even call it decarbonization of materials, it should be defossilization of materials because we can't without carbon you can't make anything. As long as that carbon came from air or somewhere, it'd be fine. So where should we get that carbon, that's the question, right? We are talking about that in a sense indirectly because there's one in air, one in ocean you talked about, and then also in rocks. So let's not touch the one in the rock because it already got stored and it doesn't move around, great, let's not touch that. Means that you have ocean or air only. That's why there's a lot of research on direct air capture and ocean capture, right? So that as long as you get those which is non-fossil carbon, you defossilize your chemical industry which should be forever and ever because we're never going to go back after lowering the CO2 concentration, taking out more fossil out of the ground millions of years from now, right? Hopefully not. So I think this is kind of new way of looking at the material cycle above the ground. So calculation of carbon negativity is kind of very tough on this case because you'll be best at best neutral.",

If I can dig out the good report, I'll share with you guys, but there are definitely many reports. Another thing is in order for CO2 conversion to chemicals and fuels, regardless any of the pathways you're talking about, hybrid or single or whatever, if you want to have a final product other than carbon, if you want to have hydrocarbon or polymers or whatever, then you need hydrogen. So cost wise, you're highly depending on the renewable energy, either electricity or heat. Second, how are you going to get carbon-free hydrogen at what cost? That makes a huge difference in techno-economic analysis as well as carbon footprint of the overall gain or loss or whatever it is. So there's a lot of people actually working on this area. Great group in Germany and Delft, both of them are doing really great work, Andreas and Andre, oh both start with A. They're great. And in US, we have great group at Argonne National Lab. They have a whole entire protocol, so LCA by EERE, how they're evaluating CO2 hybrid systems are the protocol is developed by Argonne National Lab. Michael Wong is a great person.

So so the nature of that. And so in that context, if you couple with electrochemistry with microorganism, it doesn't mean you have to feed them all the time. Of course, if you stop feeding them for a year, they probably will die. But if you don't feed them for a couple of days, once you're providing energy again, they pick up and they replicate themselves, they grow.

I was recently my lab was growing some bacteria working pH2. Good thing about that is you have a lot of you don't have much contamination at pH2 and you can add a lot of salt there so the solution get much more conductive in terms of electrochemistry. And there are also alkaline files because I was talking to yesterday I met him in gather and he asked me he challenged me can I put a bacteria inside an alkaline electrolyzer? And and actually if you go to literature you can surprisingly. Not too high not not pH 14 but pH 10 or 11 no problem at all. You can get you can have bacteria in pH 11 at three mole five mole sodium chloride. And you if you look at that you realize nature has a way to evolve and there are multi-pronged approach how biology handle things. It it really depends and sometimes I as a as a materials people chemist by training I feel like it's a treasure grove. You just look at literature you feel what what do you want? Do you want acid bacteria? Okay there are one. You want alkaline bacteria? There are one. But you need to find it out and find a way to use those.",

And instead of regenerating your material you can just add your reactant right the other reactant let's say CO2 hydrogenation right and do isothermally instead of you know changing your bed temperature.

But in terms of hybrid approaches I guess when thinking about ways of sort of coupling you know electrochemical and biological and thermal and so on I also think of hybrid as potentially a way of actually making better use of a resource that we are using to do separation or conversion. So if you for example you think about the solar resource you have let's say you're trying to do something photochemically and you have some solar cell for example it's going to harness a certain fraction of the spectrum and then you're going to get a bunch of a part of the spectrum that's you know wasted so let's say that's like thermal energy. If you engineered a system where you're sort of taking that thermal energy somewhere else to to do like a thermal you know like a thermal separation in addition to the photoelectrochemical separation you're doing then that's that's a hybrid approach that uses more of the solar resource to to accomplish separation or conversion. So you know it involves sort of thinking about a reactor that has flow involved so you're taking away the thermal energy and then you could do like I mean it doesn't have to be like thermoelectric but it could be it could be thermal in addition to photoelectrochemical.

That's very important when you put different types of reactors together with the grid which is fluctuating. Right? So you have fluctuating intermittent amount of electricity might be coming to your reactor right? And your electrochemical reactor and biological reactor has different rate of reactions and different size. Let's say you have a tiny reactor connected to huge reactor just because that's how volumetric flow rate is. Can we manage that? I mean there's a lot more questions than just a plug and play right? So how to provide energy what kind of energy and that's all about systems integration and optimization with both time scale and physical scale and those are very important. And in fact those solicitations were out there so people are getting funding in this area not in the hybrid technology. There was a proposal solicitation on connecting CO2 capture to storage. No electricity grid market to the CCS I remember. Or these are very interesting and I think going back to Fateme's earlier comments on modular reactor design maybe that's another consideration we should have.",

I got physical chemistry in PhD so I wouldn't say a fully knowledgeable about chemical biology part. But here's my take. The first part is a challenge is the throughput and the efficiency. The reason about that is if you think about heterogeneous catalysis electrolyzers, I mean they can the current density is pretty high. And the part of the reason is they they can you can run it in alkaline condition, you can give a lot of current go through it. But microorganism they have their good about enzymes but on the other hand they're fragile, right? You cannot dump them into KOH solution and most of them, right? And and so and you need to make sure that they don't die because you unintentionally generate some toxic species that just kill them. So that would be the challenges, how you can make sure it's scalable about the in the throughput part and make sure they are compatible. Another challenge I think about from engineering process is even though you can a lot of high current density now require CO2 reduction electrochemically is with gas diffusion electrode. And how can you do with that with the microbe there? And because microbe requires water around. And the corresponding question is because a lot of product are liquid phased, they are too large to be gaseous molecule. So how can you separate them? Right? Because you need to get enough titer or concentration so you can separate those molecules to make it economical and economically or energy wise feasible. I think on the other hand if you think about chemical biology part is I think we all understand that biological research take time. You need to grow. So sometimes you may not see a big jump in improvement because it just take very long time for people to optimize things and get what they want. So sometimes they're when I first started as a material scientist going into that field I realized the expectation is different. I I say I tell my student do the experiment tomorrow and you cannot tell that to biologist because they are a lot of steps you need to do before they can even do the experiment. So that that's my take about how you would like to interface with biological system and electrochemistry. It's a very interesting field and I I'm another challenge maybe is related why we as is good is I I try to apply for grant for this and I think we are lucky but sometimes if you talk to NSF, NSF would say I don't know it's for fitting CHE or CBET or DMR or it's all bioscience because it's interdisciplinary.

But let me give you a little bit of background for all of you since not everybody knows the why we care about this particular topic, I guess. The reason is that it's basically actually being funded by EERE, which is interesting, right? Because all the CO2 work used to be funded by fossil energy because we burn fossil, you make a lot of CO2. But why renewable energy lab is interested in this? Because they think this is the kind of analogous to photosynthetic biofuel production. So it's a non-photosynthetic pathway, non-photosynthetic. So which means that the biological system not going to use sunlight, they're going to use energy from gas. So they're doing gas fermentation. To do that so, CO2 is at such a low in energy, you need to boost up that energy. So they can do it electrochemically making CO2 to CO or formate or anything bugs can eat. So what they're thinking is CO2 to C1 or C2 compound will be easier",

So interesting thing is people who are working on electrochemical conversion for example, they were all used to work on formic acid, producing formic acid because it's easiest. But then the problem with what Chong was saying, separation was an issue because it's highly dissolved in low concentration in the soup, right? So you have to get that out. So what you're saying, well, why don't we make CO or something else which bubbles out a little bit more so that there's inherent separation of your product so that you don't have energy penalty in the back end. But then now, if you want to attach the biological system, you degas your gas, gaseous product, now this low solubility gas you have to redissolve to feed it to the bug, which is not a good idea in a sense when you think about it. So now everybody's moving back to soluble intermediate, right? So that if I make formic acid and bugs can just continue to eat it up. But when you think about it, we're going to have intermittent renewable energy, making your intermediates intermittently, and then now you have a bugs producing whatever rate, can you turn on on and off on and off easily seamless this system? Or the pH condition which is favored in electrochemical system would be okay for bugs down in the downstream because fluid will go in around the circle. So there are a lot of questions and the good thing is this is really beginning of conversation. And I think that's why a lot of people are going into this.",

So yeah and another thing I thought about is as you said that converting the CO in the intermediate, another drawback of CO is that CO is toxic, I mean to human being, so probably CO is could be also toxic to organisms. And so and and so that is an actual design engineering design challenge because you want to give them enough CO so it can be further upgraded, but you still want to make sure you don't give them too much CO so it will kill them. So so that is another challenge if you're using CO as an intermediate. Hydrogen fermentator as fermentation as Alissa said, that's one of the approach, but another approach at formate I think is gaining favor now again because the formate dehydrogenase is a very well very widespread enzyme to loop into the ATP synthesis synthesis pathways. So that is I think people are working on now. And but depending on the there are different ways you can design the process and there will be different challenges. I agree with that. And I appreciate ERE are interested about that because I was trying to find how which which which agency can fund our project. But thanks for letting me know about this.",

The the most appropriate and easier ones they make a tons of there are bacteria can make 99% of acetate. Bacteria can make 99% of methane or maybe 99 90% of polymer, polyhexanoate. You can directly get polymer out of CO2. We also work on bacteria that just fix ammonia, just fix nitrogen into ammonia. And we're and because they are bacteria that's a natural way of doing that. So is this their waste? Like they they release these things as waste? So so it really depends also depends. So in the case of acetate and methane, those are waste if they secrete it out. In the case of polymer, it's actually a rainy day fund for their energy budget. So what they do so they store the polymer inside their cell just in case that later they got starved they can reuse those. So that's a natural way they do it and but you can break up the cell later. That's why I talked about the separation challenge. You still need to break out the cell and you got a polymer out of that. In the case of of nitrogen, it's more complicated depending on the strain. If you think about natural symbiosis, actually bacteria secrete ammonia for plant to use. So those in that case it's a natural it's a soluble ammonia. But in other cases they make urea for themselves. And and in that case what we demonstrated is you don't need to separate those because it's organic fertilizer anyway. And those bacteria happen to be accumulate phosphate too. And if you think about the biggest use of ammonia it's a fertilizer. You have phosphate and nitrogen, it's the probably the best you want to get for the agriculture. So you don't need to you don't want you can just spray the bug in the field and that's how it works.

What it does is we're using a microbe that it's a soil microbe anyway. It eats hydrogen and it fix carbon dioxide and nitrogen. It accumulate phosphate in the solution and you basically you apply electricity by generating hydrogen and the bug basically using hydrogen as an energy source to make itself, accumulate phosphate and polyphosphate and fix nitrogen, ammonia and carbon dioxide from the air. And what's beneficial more is as you know for agriculture there are people like to use plant hormones to stimulate the root development. And it turns out that bacteria because it's soil it has a loose loosely defined symbiotic relationship with plant with soybeans at least. So so if you spray that into the field using the microbe itself, not only provide nitrogen source, ammonia and phosphorus source, it also provides some organic stimulus that facilitate the development of root system. So so it's so we thought that's organic anyway it's organic because you can think of microbe as a bag, you have nitrogen, phosphate there. So it's also have a beneficial is leaching. You don't have much leaching because they are encapsulated by the cell membrane. So because a big issue about agriculture now is using synthetic fertilizer is if it rains they washed away but with the organism they don't.",
