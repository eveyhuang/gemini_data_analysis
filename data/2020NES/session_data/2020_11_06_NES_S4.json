You go hot you push the CO away. And then you have more sites for for hydrogen generation. And so then you need to up your pressure and so I was doing CO2 reduction at a thousand to 500 PSI of CO2 reduction. Which then completely changes your mechanistic regime. So this is a can of worms this is terrible like it drove me almost mad. So just that's all I'm saying. It's like I've been a little bit around this challenge.

CO is the only thing you will get. Of course they have these challenge issues with coke formation and also they have this durability issues but they already proved they can run a thousand hours right? It's nothing we can complain say low temperature can run much longer than that we don't.

So if you think about the scalable conversion of carbon dioxide at meaningful industry scale, you have to think about the lifetime of your catalyst and associated with the cost of catalyst. I don't have too much experience with industry but maybe someone can chime in. What type of lifetime we want to achieve for catalyst for CO2 conversion? So I think the to me my limited knowledge seems the testing time for CO2 catalyst right now is about maybe I guess up to 100 hours at the moment which is apparently not good enough for scale up or long-term application. And also the I would add a different comment to Feng's comment. I think the the product selectivity, like you are doing any catalysis, selectivity is a very important, it's key, and which affects the ending purification, right? Purification is a very costly, expensive step towards final product. So I think that's two cents I would like to share.",
