So so we we talked about this in in the last subgroup is that you know at NREL we've done technoeconomic and life cycle assessments of different pathways for you know full air to barrel scenarios. And as you scale up CO2 electrolysis, whether you use something like Opus 12, which is a PEM electrolysis in acid or something like dioxide, which is alkaline, as you scale this up to you know more than 10 to 50,000 units of production, the major cost in both of those systems is the membranes. So the idea of the catalyst cost is not it's it's nothing. Even the bipolar plates are a small thing. Separations aren't too bad if we can do this well, but for both of them, the real limiting step is the cost of membranes and both the the base materials but then also the manufacturing at large scale. So I think that's where we can kind of you know look at which you know how did batteries get 10x cheaper in 10 years? Was it the cathodes that got cheaper? Was it a better electrolyte? I think we can learn like people have said from these other fields, how did they improve efficiency, reduce cost? Usually to material component or stability or durability. And and for electrolyzers, we I mean all the modeling points in any case whether we do this in acidic or alkaline conditions, the membranes are going to be the driver for for the cost.",

So the assumption is that even if it's scale you know an alkaline membrane scales the same way as a Nafion, which it may or may not, even if it does, it's still the major cost driver at I think up to 10 to 50,000 units of production.

But that you know assumes that you cannot do better performance wise, right? There's probably a metric of dollar per unit of something. That unit of something is related to your ability to do the reaction. And that assumes that you cannot do the reaction faster or using less energy or more selectively so that you don't have to separate. And so that then takes you back to the way you're doing the reaction. And are we convinced that we cannot do better?

Now for technoeconomic assessment, we actually do a sensitivity analysis to see which operational or material parameters would lead to the biggest shift in cost. And there we see that the biggest drivers are the single pass conversion efficiency and the current density. Now the issue with that is that if you look in literature, those are things where it's kind of like whack-a-mole. If somebody can do very good current current density, they have very low single pass conversion. If they have very good single pass conversion, they have low current. So in the end, we ideally would like them both. And then that is to us a frontier is that how can you do both of those things at the same time? And that takes I don't think that that's going to be solved by a cascade reaction. I think that's going to be reactor engineering and process integration that's going to solve that, not not a cascade on a catalyst surface.",

You can buy from Haldor Topsoe a skid that's you know the size of your basement and do CO2 to CO very well, very efficient, very selective, energy efficient.

I I don't think it will but we have to I mean I think that they're doing really important work for us to establish that and see and they're only making focused on making CO so their competition is their competition really is you know Haldor Topsoe. So can they do low temperature which has advantages for process integration so it's it's really cool and I think that I mean even your your analogy with Venkat with with Tesla you know Tesla was not the first electric car company. They had the biggest investment they made it look nice and all those things and I think that that moment will come but we need Opus 12 and Dioxide and we need these companies to start test scale it up see what works and doesn't and then somebody will come in maybe even Elon Musk with a lot of money.",

So if you're doing CO2 even if you start with a basic electrolyte if you start to run it more than 10 or 20 milliamps it's going to become alkaline spontaneously. So it's the electrolyte consumption but then with the with the kind of transport control there are things like pressure drops that will change and it depends on if you're making CO2 to CO so a gas feedstock to a gas product the the pressure drop across your electrode will be small but if you want to make a liquid product you will create a much bigger pressure drop across your electrode and the effects down the channel will be much more significant. So it's there there's a lot of competing factors which is why I think you know CO2 electrolysis won't scale the same way that water electrolysis does. You know selectivity is not an issue for water electrolysis. Partial pressure differences across the electrodes is is managed very well and I think for for CO2 reduction it's so big you can make a gas you can make a liquid you can make lots of products they're much more sensitive to to changing their performance based on scaling relations.",

I think electrochemistry in terms of a discipline is one where progress has been extraordinarily slow, which is because of the fact that it's a very complex system, many interacting components, needing learning, and by learning I mean you do some experiment or you do some simulation and you want to answer some hypothesis, right? And often the ratio of the number of number of experiments or number of simulations run to test a hypothesis is very very high. And that has to do with the fact that getting high quality data is very difficult. So I think here I think there's going to be a significant advancement possible especially in this sort of very complex space of CO2 where you have many different control variables, many different design variables. So I think robotic experimentation and machine learning I think is going to fundamentally alter this this space and it's going to be a frontier that electrochemistry could be very well positioned to to spearhead because a lot of the setups that we need actually are conducive for being able to do automated experiments and may not require like human handling and so on. Like doing things with like robotic arms and so on is much harder than being able to automate like flow through type setups. So I think that that aspect I think could be one that I feel very passionately about as sort of the next frontier for electrochemistry.",

We focus a lot in our group on trying to understand the mechanism and pathways to figure out which are the key steps because oftentimes selectivity for example is determined at some common intermediate that can either react with protons or CO for example and that sort of dictates what happens in the rest of the reaction. So I think I'm very in favor of using machine learning to help us discover catalysts but I think right now in some cases we don't know what the question is if that makes sense. Like what are the key bond making breaking steps what are the key intermediates in different reaction pathways that we need to understand in order to innovate selectivity. And for the first question which is about novel materials and electrode architecture I have two thoughts on that and one is that transport for capture is important because it's dilute and that's something I didn't appreciate until I started talking to engineers. And then the other thing is that can we design architectures that can do cascades because the more I do catalyst design I realize that it's hard to optimize a single catalyst to go through several steps but if you can optimize a sequence of them and then organize them then that could be a way to get better selectivity.",

Throughput computing combined with you know machine learning or trying to understand you know what targeted properties we are looking for. For example a lot of good electrocatalysts are available right. We also want to make sure is there a route to also find cost effective materials. For example platinum is not going to be the only answer every time for instance we try to do something like this. Quite famously the system here it works well but we are not going to sequester carbon dioxide using platinum. So that's where probably machine learning or you know modeling can also work with experiment to try to optimize. And I think that that could be really challenging but I think it's it's a fascinating route to follow actually.",

So I think that's scale is maybe one one challenge that there maybe there are not easy intermediate products that could get us to to that scale. Um but I don't see a fundamental reason, right? I mean, I think there's no there's actually no real reason that you couldn't imagine that uh you know, we couldn't have uh you know, another uh sort of giant instigator that takes over this field and says, okay, we're we're going to go all in on this, right?

There are already existing processes that are large scale that have a very cheap feedstock and relatively efficiently and stably can make something. So it's not that we can't make it's not that we're trying to make some product that's never been made before. The problem is the competition. It is so cheap and so large scale already that our I mean it's you know I I agree with Venkat. I mean there's not a thermodynamic or fundamental scientific reason we can't do these things, but in terms of cost, I mean even if you throw a billion dollars at it, it's still going to be way cheaper for Shell or Exxon to continue what they're doing, pay their carbon tax, and they will be just fine financially, which is you know, we have to remind ourselves that business is involved in this. So I think that the the biggest issue is that we're competing with existing technologies that have been around for a long time, are large scale, and very very cheap and efficient.",
