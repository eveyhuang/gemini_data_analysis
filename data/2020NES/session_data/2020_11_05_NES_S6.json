So synthetic chemists would like to make those materials and they focus on getting a certain product distributions but not necessarily the mechanisms or rates. So I think that there's like a there's a difference in strategy which gives us less information that we can potentially benchmark to. But I think theory can definitely pitch in when it comes to identifying product distributions the various pathways selectivities and so on. It's just finding the right match in terms of like finding this one experimentalist group that is interested in going the whole way right right from synthesizing what you think works to to showing that that is indeed the pathway. So I think it's nice that like most fields are moving towards teams of people but yeah I think you need a team because each person has their own individual interests as far as experimentalists go and while theorists have the ability to bridge all these gaps you can't just work with one person at least from what I've seen in my limited experience.",

So one of the things I I think I will have to go back to the original comment that I give which is the negative results right so there was a very beautiful paper recently well not recently two years ago where it was an organic synthesis but you can train a machine learning model that takes into account the negative results of experiments so at the end of the day you were able to predict the the right reaction path and the right conditions that are the most optimal right so I think that's where machine learning could be used because if you ever do any simple models for machine learning you will learn that the more data the better right so the more data that is accurate the better the more data that it's you know that you can reproduce the better so basically any data is good so I think that it's something missing that we can explore both as experimentalists and as a computational theoretician minded scientist that we might be discarding a lot of data that could be useful. One quick example for theory could be you know when you do your your simulation of MD you're throwing away all these different snapshots that could be so useful. One example for experiments those negative results or where where we were seeing is the all this decay maybe that decay can give you the the next design principle but you know those bottom line is I think the current thing in machine learning probably that it could be useful is just we need to find a ways to get more information more data that is more accurate and maybe look at places that we thought you know they were they were rubbish they were waste but maybe they are useful.",

I find machine learning is very useful to my research because I'm doing the so-called ab initio molecular dynamics to study the heterogeneous catalysis and for this type of calculation we basically need to sample for example hundreds of thousands structures in order to get one averaged quantity instead of just using one snapshot to tell you the the property. And in order to sample all these numerous structures if you want to calculate all these structures using for example density functional theory it will be extremely computationally expensive. So machine learning can help us in a way so that we do not need to do explicit quantum mechanical calculation for all these structures we just need to do calculation for a set for a selective set of structures and use these structures to train the machine learning model so that you can predict the of other structures without doing the heavy DFT calculations.

So I think we need to be very careful because I often find that the the computational methods used to predict the properties are problematic they are not very accurate to predict the properties. So if you use wrong data not very high quality data to train your machine learning model then you will end up with wrong predictions.

Now with a with a particle of 10 micron size, we are collecting 1.25 million XAS, X-ray absorption spectroscopy for for metal cations. So 1.25 million. So every time we do the experiment with over a week, we we get back with a 8 to 10 terabyte data. So it's at a point that we we we have to develop our own machine learning or other advanced data analysis method to analyze data. Unfortunately, we are still very slow on that end. We are still analyzing data that we collected a few years back. Now speaking of the other high throughput capability that there are a lot of experimental opportunities at at different synchrotron facilities where you can collect a thousand high quality, very high quality X-ray absorption spectroscopy spectra just in one day. Again, beamline scientists and and myself, we have been talking about how to streamline the data analysis using high throughput mode, but we are we are still not making progress on that yet.
