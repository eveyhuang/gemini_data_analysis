The US has the US life cycle inventory from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory which has some of the processes but it's missing so you usually need to fill in. And the USDA E-PACT actually has been putting together a lot of the agricultural databases. I mean agriculture is a little bit interesting right because like depending how you produce a kilogram of corn it could be vastly different in terms of things like added amendments water energy.
