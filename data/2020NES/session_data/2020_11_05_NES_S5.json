I think something that Peter said really resonated for me which is that the idea of like sort of the the social dimensions of this work and I know that a lot of us here would maybe consider ourselves to be more on the technical expert side and I think what we really need is to be working with social scientists who are really thinking about the societal sort of like how society perceives new technology or new approaches how they gain traction how those perceptions shift over time and like really needing to work with social scientists to formulate our research questions to formulate our research approaches and make sure that the work that we're doing is really grounded in the social dimensions of carbon removal and climate mitigation. So and I think from an and that includes economists that includes folks that are thinking about technology deployment that includes policy makers and folks that work in the policy space more generally. So that's kind of like where I'm landing now that we can't really decarbonize the economy without engaging deeply and meaningfully with the social sciences.",

So you can think about like anthracite mining right so it's a type of coal in the US. Europe's been a bit ahead of us on all of this in terms of developing the types of databases you use and Ecoinvent is one of the big ones. The US has the US life cycle inventory from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory which has some of the processes but it's missing so you usually need to fill in. And the USDA E-PACT actually has been putting together a lot of the agricultural databases. I mean agriculture is a little bit interesting right because like depending how you produce a kilogram of corn it could be vastly different in terms of things like added amendments water energy. So I mean I think the US is lagging a little bit behind on the actual inventory data to characterize our systems whereas Europe's been doing it for a while.",
