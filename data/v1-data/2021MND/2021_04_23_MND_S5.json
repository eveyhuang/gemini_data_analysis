Um but uh my lab will be working on sort of precision medicine approaches to understanding neurodevelopmental disorders. Um like using machine learning applied to big data. Um I think I'm here because my PhD work was in the neuroscience of the gut, the enteric nervous system. And so I have this fantasy of, you know, my early 20s work and the work I do now maybe coming together. So it's been really interesting to hear about what all of you very smart people are doing.

So the research in my lab we focus on developing nanometer scale uh neurotransmitter sensing probes that can probe the dynamics of neurotransmission with fast response time. So at the time skill of the occurrence of the neurotransmission. So we also developing uh platforms that can probe different kinds of neurotransmission like chemical transmission as well as electrical transmission. And the third focus is to probe multiple groups of uh small neurotransmitter molecules as well. So for example like in neurodegeneration it all often like involves more than one kind of neurotransmitter.

Um just a snippet of what we kind of do in the in the intersection of microbiome and neurobiology. We're looking at the role of gut bacteria in causing alpha synuclein aggregation in the gut. We know that alpha synuclein the alpha synuclein aggregates are involved Parkinson's disease. Those aggregates um there's a lot of evidence suggesting that they originate in the gut before they um end up in the brain and they get there through the vagus nerve. We're studying the role of dopamine and iron, specifically iron speciation um in the gut um in order to actually um sort of map how how alpha synuclein happens and which bacteria are involved and what the specific chemical environment is.

So we have electrochemical methods and uh colorimetric methods. But that's how we try to do it.

I mean, there are ways of there there are ways of engineering uh wearables and pills that you can, you know, you can take orally and then uh they have the biosensors incorporated and and they can sense as they go through the GI tract um and report on what they're sensing.

So to me it starts out with clean cohorts of patients. Um perhaps you choose a disease that has a fairly well defined early phenotype that you can detect it early. Um so some of what Elizabeth is doing with alpha for example. Um and then once you have that disease specific information, I think then you jump into models and you put those things in in mice or in dishes and try to manipulate from there. But as long as the question is directly tying to early stage neurological disease, there's so many caveats with models. I think you have to start with people and then go backwards.

Um and uh I I appreciate what you're saying Sarah or um sorry, Aaron about um the yeah, like starting with the like finding a something that we actually see in real life in people, but then also kind of backtracking to simplify the other variables to kind of build up uh like a mechanism and something that I I think I guess a lot about in the um Parkinson's and I guess more broadly neurological disease is that it feels like uh we're just adding more and more of these variables to kind of create a a more complete picture and that there are a large panel probably of biomarkers and um and and we're just kind of like incrementally adding to create a more full picture.

Now, as a clinician, I think and some of the other um people, I'm sorry, I can't see your names right away, but um we're just talking about, you know, talking from the sort of top like top down. So you take the whole person and what can you detect in the whole person that gives you a biomarker. And I've been thinking about this a lot in autism because I've been doing some neuroimaging work trying to find like a neuroimaging biomarker in autism. I mean first of all, autism is not one thing. I think there's in 10 years we're going to know there's like 15 things we used to call autism and there's genetic autism, there's idiopathic autism, there's blah blah blah, right? But anyways, so you take this top down approach and to me a biomarker is not necessarily one thing, it's a collection of things that's almost like a fingerprint, you know, like the biomarker is a signature that's not that's not one thing you do a lab test for.",

There've been a couple with like cancer immunotherapy trials um and usually it's a group like with ASD, the studies have been, you know, people who have typical however that's defined clinically symptoms of ASD versus typically behaving controls or for cancer immunotherapy responders versus non responders and so they have those two cohorts and then they collect fecal samples from those, they sequence them, they do all the metagenomic analysis at the human level and then they transfer those samples into germ free animals. And then in some cases like in the ASD models, they actually develop sort of some of the stereotypic behaviors as translated to mice like marble bearing and ultrasonic vocalization and stuff which are typical I guess in that model system of ASD, but they use that to mine metabolomic uh data for microbial metabolites that are say very high in the ASD recipient animals versus the typically developing recipient mice.",

And I I think about this as well just for uh, I mean this is slightly different tangential, but we study H pylori and some of you may know there's a breath test for that, which is based on bacterial urease production, which can break down urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide, which can be detected using a breath test and I wonder about those as I mean those are again metabolites but small molecule volatiles that can be, I don't know, in terms of biomarkers I think are really fascinating too.",

This pathway might involve both the microbe intermediate epithelial cell and neuron. So in that case, maybe we can also start from for example, this epithelial cell, um, what type of receptor they express? Do they somehow have more preference for certain ligand? Again, that ligand might be the product from the microbe, either protein peptide or metabolite. Um, and then I was looking at the question of our group, seems like what we what we're discussing was a a two-step process. Um, like starting from human patients, that's more like identification of what might be the more relevant biomarker. And then can this knowledge be used to diagnosis or or even treatment. That seems like what uh Starla was describing making uh basically transfer this uh different population of for example, fecal samples to the germ free animal and then see whether that actually recapitulate the pathology. And then maybe going back to the to the human uh study to validate or even predict. Um, seem seems like it's it's like it's like a two step to to first identify and then um validate and predict.",

Of course, right, control experiments can be carried out between like you know health and disease models.

So this is really add like you know another level of complexity when you try to look for the biomarkers because it varies from people to people, right?

So when you have a system that function and there are things are produced within the system, which we call like kind of like gross rates, right? Things are just happening within the systems and it doesn't really affect the net output. So, um, you you have your your microbiome any other system and you're exposing it to food and environmental conditions and there are things happening within it, but that necessarily doesn't affect the outside world. But then you have a set of outputs that are the ones that you're actually looking at as your biomarkers that would potentially impact something else in the organism. So that's the way I see this and I am really focused on how do human beings um in general respond to environmental contaminants. So how does the microbiome um either changes following exposure to all these cocktails of contaminants that we are adding to the environment that humans are now exposed to that they weren't exposed to and how does this microbiome both changes as a results of that, um, impact in fact impacting your development and uh, and then the other way around too, how does the microbiome changes those contaminants and what is the output um compounds from that and then how do these impact uh the the health of the individual.

If they're like going wild or if they're just kind of like in the background and fine.

This is something that we deal with when we work with sediment or sea water or any any type of matrix where a slight change in redox conditions just going to completely change the species of the metals that you're looking at. So it's not representative of of your sample. So I mean the trick is just to try to your best to work in the same conditions as so if you're like in anoxic environment, obviously you have to keep your your sample anoxic and um it's it's it's timing too have to be fast. You know, you can't let it sit around for two weeks before you do the measurements has to be done uh as soon as possible. So you try to mitigate, you know, a change in conditions in order to maintain that. Uh for the speciation itself, it really depends on which metals you're working with. I do a lot of um not redox speciation but um like which which uh compound speciation type work. So I work at different organometallic compounds.",
