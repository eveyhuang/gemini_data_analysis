Sing um different lineages and strains of bacterial species that can are more successful in colonizing different range of hosts. So some would be, you know, more host restricted, some would have broad host range, but all of these within a single species. So I would be very interested in to find out more about what are the um uh different um genetic variants that make these different strains, different lineages more successful in certain host species. And I was thinking from the point of view of, you know, looking at positive selection um on each of those different host species. Um and it may be um the presence of certain mutations or the presence of certain accessory genes um that make them more successful in colonizing certain host species and switching to a new host species.

So uh understanding uh uh you know, different variants appearing will be uh important for this, especially if we are talking about then uh the uh receptor recognition of viruses to like different viruses having mutations occurring like now you everyone knows about SARS virus but it has been happening for flavi viruses and other viruses too. Uh and then they adapt to new um new cell types and they spread. For example, we talk about chicken gunya having a single mutation uh able to adapt to new mosquito species and uh just single amino acid mutation can do that.

I think it's also a very nice link to that because these modifications are almost exclusively, not entirely exclusively, but almost exclusively being put in by host protein machinery and I just I don't know. I just wanted to let people know about that that's something we're working on and have evidence um for example the SARS RDR RDRP um complex being reconstituted in vitro really seeing massive changes in um in how it functions.

            "transcript": "So I I I can try and respond to that. So sometime back we did a study on toxoplasma. Uh this is a parasite that infects almost all warm blooded animals including human beings. So what we found was let me just go back a little bit. So the study was we selected two kinds of individuals, those that develop a severe infection after being infected while in utero. That's when they are babies in the womb. So if they are infected during that time, they are born with severe infection like brain damage, eye damage and often, you know, they don't live long. Then there are those who get infected while in the womb, but you know, they are born normally, but they have a parasite. It doesn't cause any damage. So what we did then, we observed where there was generational differences. So we followed up individuals who when they were born, they had the disease, but they had no specific symptoms or pathology and then they went on to have children and those children also were born infected and they had no pathology. The other way we followed up individuals who were born and they had some kind of pathology, either eye damage or brain damage, but they survived, grew up and went on to have children who also got infected and you know, they developed pathology. So what we did on we found two specific genes are called nap one and let me talk about nap one a little bit. So nap one is a gene that is involved in the formation of what are called inflammasome. So these are important for innate immune responses that, you know, activate the expression of cytokines, for example, that are involved in prevention of actual establishment of infection. We found that there were actually just small single mutations within the gene, you know, not so many. Just those simple mutations would, you know, kind of confer resistance or susceptibility to the parasite, which I think is all related to genetics of the host. But on the other hand, we did also a study using two right models, one that is completely resistant to toxoplasma, the other one that's susceptible, you know, once it's infected, it will eventually die from the infection. While the other one would get infected and within probably a few hours clear the infection completely, you won't ever see the parasite in the system. So what we found was there was a way that that rat that is susceptible, you know, kind of differs from the one that's resistant in that there are some molecules that the resistant rat over expresses and those molecules are involved in clearance of the parasite. So what that tells us probably there could be something to do with epigenetics, you know, that relates to expression or activation of expression of genes or something to do with activity of promoters and so on and so forth. So when we look at the sequences of those genes that were either over expressed or under expressed in the resistant and susceptible mouse rat rather respectively, we found that there was particularly no difference in the sequence of the gene. What we don't know is what is on the promoter and what's activating the expression of the genes in the resistant rat. So quite clearly, there is something at play in the way the host responds to infection vis-a-vis genetics or epigenetics, which will determine whether the host to be susceptible or not susceptible or whether you see pathology or you don't see pathology.",

Um Ebola is a big one. You know, there's very few changes between something like Reston and a little and a more virulent one and they've tried to make all these changes and they haven't been able to associate it with uh the differences in pathogenesis that they see. So I do agree with William that with that it's probably a lot of the host and the epigenetics and just the genetics can play an important role. Um, but you know with West Nile as it passed through the United States and have changed and even now with SARS CO2, um, you know, they they see the changes in the mutants, they're doing the sequencing and they're they're trying to correlate it to other stuff, but um, so for me it it can be very dependent, but it's a very difficult aspect to determine. Um, sometimes like I said with Ebola, I know they've been trying to do it for years and it just they just haven't been able to figure out the actual genetics because that I mean that was one goal that some people were having was to try and predict future outbreaks especially after the big 2013 one. Um, you know, why why was this one so different? What was the genetics? Why was the genetics different or was there anything associated with the genetics of the virus that caused this huge outbreak?

Uh but I think those studies are hard and and probably lengthy is my guess. Uh but I know we were talking yesterday in the reception a little bit. Here at Illinois, we started doing testing of all the students and all the staff twice a week mandatory last summer. And so that means that there is a whole year of data of about 53,000 people that were all tested twice a week. I I hope because all of that data is there that uh that this will be mined for all kinds of different uh uh uh parameters. Um I don't know if we will have enough data of the people that tested positive and if we have all of that information on host, host immunity, transcriptomics, uh epigenetics, my guess is probably not. but but if the samples were frozen, uh maybe, maybe we can go back and can do a lot of analyses of these positive cases. And of course, patient wide and globally, there's a lot of samples that can be looked at retrospectively for things we don't know. And so maybe making a list of what would be good things to look at that either people are already looking at or perhaps not because we don't know what other people are doing.

Yeah, yeah, like uh I think uh I I work on toxoplasma trying to look at how their host is is uh susceptible or resistant. Uh one thing I can tell you toxoplasma is an intracellular pathogen. So the mechanism that the host uses to counteract it is kind of uh similar to all intracellular pathogens, not just parasites, but uh is also quite related to the mechanisms that the host will use against tuberculosis for example, which is intracellular. Like all pathogens that go into the cell and form a vacu around them are attacked pretty much in the same way by the host. So it's basically dependent on how does the pathogen invade the host and how does it uh protect itself from the host. So if if it those path if a group of pathogens that are completely different but they have similar characteristics, the host do have pretty much the same mechanism of attacking whether it's a virus, bacteria or a parasite or whatever it is.",

They're very conserved different than between the million species and there's they're also fairly conserved in the insects as well. And so we're actually going to try to start looking to see if the virus activates at different times the GTPases or doesn't activate and that is that why we see differences in insects versus the mammal uh the mammalian cells, but we're also looking at the different species of the insects, the different agricultural uh species cell lines that we have as well just because there can be slight differences and we don't know what it is. And right now the virus doesn't actually hasn't been shown to interact with the GTPases. It's just like it binds to the cell and all of a sudden these GTPases can be activated or activated down the line. And so we're just actually looking at the activation now um and or we will be. Um but we're we're kind of going along that line as well. So it's it's it's a totally different area for me. So it was nice to have this person with that expertise come in and try to do it. But once again, that's something that even though it's highly conserved, there might just be slight differences um between the animals and it it is being used for possible treatment for cancer too.

I guess maybe thing I one thing I'd be curious about is um this would be hard to study but it from what I'm hearing it seems like the pathogen jumps to a human host and it's has to adapt within that human host and then and then it can spread more widely. And so I'd be really interested in knowing if those initial human hosts where the pathogen jumps, are they what is their immune response like? Is it that they are slightly worse at controlling it and that gives it an opportunity to mutate and adapt or is it or is it that the mutations were already there that allowed it to go into that host and do well. So I mean what what how much of this is the pathogen's mutations and how much of it is the host's immune response.",

I know they're working on things like that. But you know, is would if we use something like that like the polyphenols or anything like that, would it be more broad based target where they're actually attacking more of like the transcription of viruses or something that's needed to actually that's applied to a lot of the RNA viruses.
