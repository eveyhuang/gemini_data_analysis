You know, insect pressure can drive animals to move quite a bit. And then you're not just talking about the insects because then you also have to consider all of the factors that go into where those insects are at and why they're at the populations that they're at that are driving those movements. So you get many layers deep in the complexity of what's driving movement patterns in these different groups and I I feel like it's going to be very challenging to do a broad generalization on that.",

But even with migration, I will say that uh I mean it's very what's driving the actual migration or the factor that are determining the timing of that migration is could be very system and even like within ungulate species will be fairly can be fairly different. So uh yes, I think this I I still struggle to see like if we want to move toward generalize I think the only way we can move towards more generalizable models like for movement is to we need to move away from like specific kind of environmental co areas and more moving towards like more like first principles like well every animal move well most of them move in response to foraging but what is foraging for them is very different depending on the system you deal like what system you're dealing with. So it's somehow we still need to we can make them general generalizable but we still need to have that system specific insights before being able to get at that to an extent.",

So I wonder if it's possible that um that, you know, just just the the mechanisms that underpin specific kinds of interactions that are say or specific kinds of kinds of movement that are salient to disease should be it might be useful to focus more on those as opposed to like movement writ large, you know, because I'm not sure if we need all of movement to understand the salient portions for disease.

We take these hosts, we don't, you know, like when I work on megafauna, right? So we catch an animal, we get one cross-sectional sample, we can we are not calibrated to forecast disease dynamics well or or internal state well within the animal. And so we don't know how susceptibility is varying. So I think that in my mind at least, the information gap surrounding where everyone else is and what's actually happening in the animal seem like way bigger um obstacles than improved remote sensing. However, maybe there's a way to remotely sense moving animals without instrumenting them. That would be awesome.",

Um, and I was part at some point of a group called Rapid, you know, research and policy in infectious disease dynamics and we talked a lot about movement. And we came up with, you know, a big limitation which is we don't even have open access data to really mine and and come up with these general patterns that might be there that could help you understand um some of the phenomena on on scalability, different animals or even humans, you know, which is what we were working on. Um, so I agree with this the big challenge is how can you translate from individual studies and and and settings to a trend of mobility, exposure and and I guess emergence. Um, and there are good studies. We did work with uh dogs in Tanzania trying to understand how SIV is jumping from domestic animals to chimpanzees. So we had to individually track all the dogs and see that they had common areas in the, you know, crop area next to the park where the chimpanzees are going and the dogs are meeting. So maybe it's not that much individual animals, but it's patterns that lead you to areas where these encounters occur and that's what really you should care about, you know, more than the individual tracks.",

I I think in terms of the scale issue, you know, I'm hearing a lot of consensus about the value of, you know, individual animal level studies. Um, you know, potentially there's value even in, you know, doing more of those tracking individual animals uh, you know, over time in terms of uh, you know, maybe infection by various pathogens. And you you know, there's a need for, you know, those very detailed uh and precise measurements to often, you know, to be able to disentangle uh the complexities of a local disease transmission cycle. Um, often, you know, the specific characteristics of that will not extrapolate to other areas, but I think there's a big potential for gaining a better understanding of important mechanisms that are, you know, that are often broadly more important beyond an individual system. the other thing I I kind of hear everyone kind of also sort of maybe almost using that as a reference point but stretching toward this idea, you know, toward the the fuzzier picture of you know, what types of data, what framework do we need for a you know, maybe something in the context of much larger scale continental to global surveillance. And you know, I I kind of feel like what you're reaching for there is some level of abstraction. Because when you when you get up there, you're not going to be dealing with individual animals. you know, it's not going to be I think it's we all recognize, it's not going to be feasible to track every single animal on the continent. But you know, what what is it that would be the most useful, you know, would it be, you know, just throwing out one example off the top of my head, is it, you know, much better uh, you know, detailed maps of key migration routes. being able to understand, you know, the timing of migration, how they might light up earlier or later in different years. Um, you know, when particular species might be moving, how those might be shifting from year to year. So, uh anyway, I I just wanted to try to um, you know, try to frame some of those ideas in terms of where I hear you all going. But uh, I'll kind of put it back to the the group now.",

I mean, there's thousands of thousands of animals um and people who are working them on a daily basis. And then wildlife, I'd be concerned with hunters, um hunters interaction with animals, possibilities for disease transmission. I know like brucellosis case, there was a hunter who made cut his hand while he was field dressing the deer and so I think there's a lot of different interaction points to take into consideration.

But, you know, I I think I've heard a couple of examples of where we have newer inexpensive technologies that could help to maybe facilitate more of these study types of studies or local monitoring or increase the uh, you know, the volume of data. And, you know, then again on that on that upper end the, you know, talking about things like, you know, animal density. Are there, you know, sort of conceptual frameworks and abstractions that we can use to uh, you know, to extend some of these monitoring ideas over broader areas. I I think the other one that was brought up was the idea of looking at change. The fact that, well, maybe from a disease emergence standpoint, it's being able to detect where we're seeing a, you know, some type of a disturbance or a perturbation that's leading to a, you know, a shift in these contact patterns that uh, you know, could could provide the impetus for spillover events.

So if you kind of imagine it where you have, you know, a bunch of like like nodes on the landscape. Maybe they're farms um or ponds or something that's very discreet where you can say, well, we have something happening within these within this farm. Um but then we might not necessarily know what's happening within that farm or maybe we don't care all that much about find the details what's happening within that farm. But understanding the connectivity between those nodes is something that would be slightly more feasible. Um both from obviously from a farm standpoint that's very feasible because you know what cow is moving from farm A to farm B. But then also in wildlife if you if you have a population that's structured like that more of a kind of standard metapopulation, um you can use, you know, potentially genetic tools where you only need to sample a few individuals to understand something about connectivity between those nodes.",
