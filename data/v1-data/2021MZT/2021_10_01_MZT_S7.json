So it would be nice to have the ability for work on modelers or with people that are tracking tracking populations and start making some of these predictions that may allow us to get ahead of the disease right right before that transmission takes place but in my head I jump from I have some animals and I want to know where the next transmission events is happening but I don't know how to do that in the in the in the in domain. I have an idea of what my end product is going to be but I'm definitely talking to people that can actually make it happen or can develop the system or things like well we're also tracking these other you know surrogate parameters or perhaps animal movement or other diseases and things like that that we can then use to inform you know the question that I'm trying to ask.",

Yeah, it seems like in order to identify reservoirs and the risk of reservoir potential and the risk, yeah, I totally agree. So we need we need to recruit information from multiple different dimensions. I mean you can have you can have your lab studies that are testing, you know, competence at whatever molecular level you're testing competence at. That can tell you something important about one dimension of reservoir potential, but you also have your surveillance studies in the field that are telling you something about well what is what is serology looking like or true prevalence looking like at different locations. Um kind of combining those two streams will be important. And then like Sarah, you were saying, if you have data on and people do this, if you have data on um like the reservoir potential of mule deer and a couple other servants, then can you make a prediction about what reservoir potential is going to be like in white tail deer. So kind of combining these different sources of information seems like a really rich way to go. Um rather than kind of just being like, oh, I did a lab study called it reservoir species or oh, I saw this prevalence in the field call call it called it a reservoir species, but kind of this integration, I think that's a really cool point.",

So it's a very rich data set. Um and there are ways so I'm participating right now in a big mammal survey across the US with camera traps. So there is a lot of information that it's being leverage, I think also we're moving into a new area era that it's it's slowly taking off. Um there's a lot of I I being on the field so I I understand um the perspective of being in the field collecting all this data and then just putting out there and there's just a modeler that takes all the data and publishes a lot of papers and then I'm like I took three years to collect this data.

Um, where we've noticed that some of the new variants coming out, um, they no longer interact with bat receptors. Um, they you know, so you might view them as becoming more human specific variants of the virus or they interact now with receptors in other animals and then that may mean that the reservoirs in the future from which um virus might come back, you know, go into a new reservoir, come back and reinfect people, you need to consider because then they may um be sources of new genetic diversity. So for example, people are testing monoclonal antibodies against variants of SARS COV2 that moved into mink and became mink adapted. And we'd like to know will those monoclonal antibodies for use in humans, do they will they still work against the mink SARS COV2, which might come back and reinfect us and and have different diversity.

Yes. you start to see, you know, you may be able to infer from those mutations and then then you look out and you see how the virus is is adapting in in different hosts. You may be able to make some inferences without directly testing every time. Um SARS COV2 is an interesting case because um the binding site for the receptor in in the virus even though it's functionally conserved for binding to a certain key receptor, um it's sequence diverse because in bats, the receptor H2 is very polymorphic. And so it's thought that these coronaviruses have adapted so that the the viral spike at some level can tolerate lots of mutations without breaking its activity. So that way it's well positioned to to pick up mutations and and adapt to bind with high affinity to different H2s and different bat species and the likelihood of breaking the viral spike with any single mutation is low. So that means it can tolerate a lot of sequence diversity and that has huge implications for the you know potential resistance and you know many antibody drugs for example, they're all targeting the receptor binding site and yet that site can easily change.",

So I'll apologize for loud sounds in the background. Um, so so one thing we haven't perhaps incorporated into this multidisciplinary approach, right? To determining what makes a good reservoir host, um, potential for spread, um, migration, proximity to domestic species, etcetera, is actually looking at the pathogen itself, right? So so do we have a database out there that's looking at that evolutionary, you know, biology of that pathogen and how the pathogen is is changing through that particular reservoir host. So obviously for something like bacterium, I I don't necessarily worry about uh having escape mutants or anything like that. The evolution of that particular path particular pathogen is is really not of concern necessarily within, you know, a generation. But certainly for viruses is is that something else that we perhaps need to include into this model, right? That may just by looking at the pathogen and how the pathogen is is changing may make predictions about movement and what the next reservoir host may be or or how that would change how good or how bad a reservoir is for that particular pathogen.",

So what is the how are they going to contribute to onward transmission and the the transmission change in general.
