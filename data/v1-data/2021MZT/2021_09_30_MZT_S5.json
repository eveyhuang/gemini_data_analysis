So I've worked with economists, I've worked with um sociologist and most of my work on doing my PhD was in rural communities. And one of the things that we were not really paying attention to was the human movement or that it was a very cultural aspect. Uh so there was indigenous communities in the Gran Chaco region, which is really interesting if we talk about anthropogenic change because that's at the expansion of the agricultural frontier. So there's a lot of deforestation, human displacement happening. But one of the things that caught us our attention, we were like doing yearly uh entomological surveys to collect triatomines. And from one year to the next, people will move. Like they literally destroy their house, they're mud houses and build them somewhere else. We're like, we could not not find the house to do like a longitudinal surveillance. And and then we understood that it was just a cultural thing. It was also enhanced by the socio economic conditions. Um but it they were semi nomadic communities. So you cannot and that had a huge impact on the population of the vector because you didn't give enough time for the vector to um create high densities. But on the other side, you create really um the house are very precarious, so more opportunities for any bug outside bug to invade and have an infestation in that house. So it had a really interesting tradeoff just on without even thinking about how people get exposed to it, just on the vector population. And we were not really thinking about that because culturally to us it's like, well, you've been in this house, you're at least going to be there for a couple years. Uh but they would move frequently. And so we started working with sociologists trying to understand why because if we want to do an intervention and design an intervention strategy to spray the houses, we need to take into account that movement because it's not the same if you're spraying a house and it's going to last for the effect is going to last for this long, whether it's like, no, it's not going to last because in three months they're going to be somewhere else. Um so yeah, I do think that's a really key part of it and that's kind of what it actually drove my interest in trying to incorporate the human, the cultural and behavioral aspects.",

It seems to all be interconnected and I would like to add going back initially what was talking about and some others is like this interface area where you have livestock, wildlife, humans coming into contact. I feel like one of the shortcomings here is is some type of early detection system, right? As as the pathogens are moving into these habitats whether it's through environmental change, we've now created an environment where domestic species like can now move into that area where they previously didn't or we've increased human populations in these areas but or we've increased livestock deforestation and then growing livestock in these areas. Um we don't know what's happening as we're cutting down these trees and changing these ecosystems, what types of pathogens, what types of threats are actually there and we're often reactive. Oh now we see the the infections are happening but it's already too late at that point because it's already kind of taken off or got the snowball effect. But the development and this is probably futuristic but some type of technological advancement that allows us to early detect in these interface systems threats. And I don't know what those are but I'm just throwing out Star Trek type ideas of where we could go with this in the future.",

And uh when we isolate viruses from them, we can see their uh growth kinetics or their uh their properties are different.

Um, so there has to be a bit of a a change in our mentality towards how we view these viruses and um, and a change in how we allocate resources. I think there is good news. I think um, you know, the Sears influenza network has focused its resources on more of these animal human interfaces instead of just going out and sampling birds in Delaware Bay endlessly.

Uh, but they're the good the good thing is like you can think about targeted interventions. like, okay, we understand that dogs may be a problem for this sonatic diseases, especially for some of them are really infectious um to the vector to other hosts. So maybe we can think about how we limit the trans the onward transmission if we cannot limit the population or if limiting the population just get us to a point but we cannot uh we can't eliminate dogs.
