So although lately I've been focusing more on the modeling the epidemiology and the ecological processes. I have a strong foundation and interest in evolutionary processes as well. So especially like drivers of host jumps, um, what sort of environmental environmental factors drive viral adaptation.

And then recently I've been using genomic technologies to move into the realm of highly multiplex serology. So looking at thousands to hundreds of thousands of antigens in a single assay and broadly characterizing antibody reactivity. And I'm excited to start looking at that within wildlife and at that human animal interface. Uh unfortunately, I'm going to have to run and teach basically now.

Like if you have a highly defended host or like, you know, they have high white blood cells, does that mean that they're sick? Does that mean that they are like ready to go or even if you look at it like from at evolutionary lineages, if something we can infer it's been under strong pathogen driven selection, does that make it any more or less likely to be a reservoir for infections? Does that mean like, oh, it's been under the strong pressure or maybe it's like really equipped and it pretty healthy. So I and with all this viral screening data and sort of data about hosts, what does that actually mean for spillover? So that first prompt might have been from one of my pre conference surveys.",

So I I I'm really interested in how these different systems can generate diversity uh itself. Um and and increase risk.

Because you would think that the first animal that normally gets infected, let's say like a bat, uh, they have a different immune response than a pig.

You you you change you see changes in epito and you change see changes in receptor and that's when they then become able to infect humans. Like this is very well known like in influenza. In influenza the the influenza virus has the the per influenza has to pass through pigs in order to be able to infect humans. So we do know that there are pressures. We just don't know like to what extent these pressures uh are necessary for the for these pathogens to then spill over to humans.",

And then so we can have a more extensive um, you know, genomic surveillance of all those different reservoirs and potential amplification hosts. Um, I think that's at least for me that's where epidemiology now is moving and then if we can extend this to non-human hosts, you know, because whole genome sequencing has been widely used for in in uh infections of humans, if we can you know, extend that to different animal hosts, that would be great.",

Um and obviously I'm I'm close to Justin's comments on on variants. it sounds like there's like a sampling effect. If you have a whole lot of variants out there, if you've got more and more of them then there's the increased probability that one of those is going to have the capacity to to spill over and infect a novel host potentially. So from from an intervention perspective then it's controlling the number of variants that you have within the course of infection and then that establishes the next infection within your host population. So trying to minimize variants over time. And so that got me thinking about host effects. And if we just remove all of our biases and ecological knowledge and biological knowledge and this goes to one of Kim's points, um so removing all of the the stuff that makes us love biology potentially, the details and just looking at a box and saying this is the box and this is the box in which a virus or a bacteria replicates. What I'm what impacts that replication process and transmission process within the individual host between hosts and then across the landscape. And identifying the core drivers that may be influencing those dynamics because all of those dynamics are going to impact that huge cloud of variants that emerges.",

            "transcript": "And then there's also the order and timing of how these things happen. So if you get infected by something at point A, what happens at point B if you're challenged by a subtly different pathogen. So when we think about the swine respiratory disease complex and this was a Justin point, this enormous cloud not just of influenza, but of RSV, of other viruses and then bacterial infections. So the secondary bacterial infections that they may may then take off antibiotic resistance stuff. And how can we then think about those transient dynamics and rare events and model those. So that was mostly me just rambling about the things that I'm thinking about trying to get out get out that bigger idea of how can we minimize the cloud of variance and if we minimize that cloud of variance, we might minimize the probability of spillover and emergence. And it could be done by thinking about the immune response within an individual host and how that impacts within host evolution and then between host evolution. And we may not need to have really highly parameterized models. We could just say this host has an immune response to this pathogen and then what happens subsequently. And then you could run evolutionary models on that or or network based models or landscape based models as well potentially. So that's my two two cents there.",

But sort of extending on what what uh Tavis just said is that if you have these animals this animal population like a domestic population, domestic chickens are not alive very long. There's really no uh standing immunity that's built in the population. Uh there's for a lot of these animals it's just constant turnover. Even with even with pigs, right? That they're constantly turned over. So you don't actually get a strong immune selection to reduce that diversity um that that happens uh at that after jump. But this relative differences in immune selection I I think is something that we know very little about beyond the individual scale. At the population scale, we we really don't know much about it and we don't know much about it uh between different populations either. We just sort of we like from my side we'll look at a phylogenetic tree and say the shape of the tree it's clearly because of immune selection and then maybe move on. Um so yeah, I I think that was putting that on a on a larger scale at landscape and going from from individual to to uh uh between and then population. I I think that's a very interesting approach or suggestion.",

We don't all have the same population of like the same immune response.

So if we think about the epidemiology side, we know that, you know, high host growth rates, you know, can lead to more transmission and therefore more viral replication and more genetic diversity. Um, and then we have this other side of things which is these immune factors that, you know, might cause bad physiological conditions in the host. So worse replication for the virus, not as much genetic diversity. And then we have these other situations where you get a high immune response and so there's like a strong immunity pressure, strong selection. So these kinds of I I thought about these questions like way back during my PhD with is there can we predict evolution based on environmental conditions. So if you have a situation that, you know, the pathogen can't propagate in very well, but a hard selection pressure, are there fewer ways to adapt in that context than if you're able to replicate to high rates, um, and maybe selection is weak. Um, so I just started thinking, you know, more recently I've been working in the world of epidemiology and thinking about all of the ecological processes and then folks who keep on the um evolutionary side, I still feel like these fields are a little bit siloed and our techniques, you know, the file dynamics have really been trying to bring in the demographics into um inference about evolution. But there's so much more to do, like we're still not really bringing in like the um environmental conditions and these different selection pressures that are in the environment as well as we could, you know, because like when we want when we want to go about predicting, you know, out there, where should we look for or where where is the high risk for an emerging disease, we got to be able to link these environmental conditions to this these evolutionary processes and I feel like that's kind of what we're missing. So I really I think what Hannah suggested in trying to understand, you know, what host immune factors should we be looking for. If we can be able to correlate those host immune factors to different within host conditions that affect the virus evolution, it seems like that's a good sort of avenue of questioning. Um, and I was thinking like it would be nice to sort of like list very broadly because I'm not an immunologist, but I've tried to dabble in like immunologist data and I'm like this is so confusing. Um, but like if an immunologist could tell me like, oh, when I get this reading, essentially that means the immune system is primed and there's like strong selection on the virus. Um, versus like when I get this reading, the host is super stressed out, it's not good conditions for viral replication. You know, then we could have these real basic traits that we could be putting in epidemiological models that are directly correlated to effects on viral evolution.",

But there's the more we know, the the clearer that this is just, you know, one of the millions hurdles that these organisms have to. So I think like looking at it from a holistic perspective on both sides, right? You know, a the the most random factor in the environment might be actually selecting for some traits that we don't really know have a major advantage in in colonizing the host. Again, we know that if you can, you know, avoid getting, you know, immune cells to detect you, that's a that's a wonderful thing if you want to kill us. But how about, you know, Sarah mentioned metabolic processes. Uh, how about the ability to use some some um, some nutrients and out compete things like the microbiota because you know, these guys if you want to colonize the gut, there's been somebody living there way longer than you. So you you have to take care of that as well. So there's like um, so this kind of juncture, right? juncture of what do you need to become a pathogen and what is giving you those traits in in the environment, you know, the training ground basically. So I I think that you know that kind of I it was useful that uh Kim mentioned that right after Sarah. So I think those two are one and the same, right? Uh two sides of the same coin.",

So it's a little bit, you know, like I was saying earlier, a lot of times we think we need to collect data uh before we do the modeling. At least that's the the cultural view in the in my agency and the folks I work with. But you know, if we have data in hand that we have no frameworks to use and don't know how to incorporate, then there's going to be a giant lag before we actually use that data and know if it's useful.

That checkerboard um exists across all of the special scales that we're talking about. Uh and then there could be different things taken at each at each spatial scale and at each of those scales we could run file dynamic analysis as well. So in Justin's web for example, or with collaborators here, we can take an individual Petri dish that's made up of a layer of cells and infect that layer of cells and then sequence everything that is within that cell, that that cell layer and then do phylogenetics on that. And a broader scale then we can look at individual animals and and do sequencing during the course of infection and look at phylodynamics there across the herd and then across populations and scale there um with a targeted study. Uh and then look at each of those levels, try and control predictive variables that we believe are are important in driving the evolutionary dynamics of these viruses. So within individual Petri dishes we could do a heat wave treatment or a nutrient limitation treatment. Somebody mentioned energy limitation in one of the their studies, I think it might have been Sarah. You know the idea we've got there an Eltonian pyramid, right? Where you've got restriction of energy all the way up and then viruses and bacteria filtering off that energy at different traffic levels. But the the idea would be that we could manipulate abiotic environments at each of those different spatial scales and then have targeted sequencing at each of those scales as well and track the evolutionary dynamics with the prediction that at particular time points there's going to be these clouds of variants that uh can emerge and spill over and cause pandemics.",

Other ones, here's ones that need to be experimentally tested, potentially could and then work with the theoretician to say, you know, now we got some information about the host based on what we see from the from the viral sequence.

And you know, you look at a tree like a um um oak. I don't I don't know trees. Um and then most of those oaks when there's a mass year, they fall right around that that's a curve, right? So most of the oak acorns are falling right around the base of the tree. And then there's one of those acorns that gets grabbed by a little squirrel and then dashes off and that seeds that next big oak tree that forms the forest. So how can we capture that dynamic with our pathogens and pandemics? Do we just apply plant dispersal curves to pandemics or do we come up with a different framework theoretically and think about it that way? I don't know.

Um, something that it's really hard unless you have an amazing data set, um, which um they are very hard to get, but in model systems that make becomes a little bit more feasible.

It's kind of reiterating what you just said, but there are so many different factors that drive different movement patterns and just, you know, insects come to mind for me because, you know, talking about like the migration of the caribou in Northern Canada, they found that insect populations actually drive these caribou migrations. You know, insect pressure can drive animals to move quite a bit. And then you're not just talking about the insects because then you also have to consider all of the factors that go into where those insects are at and why they're at the populations that they're at that are driving those movements.

It is our ability to wall to wall collar everybody or alternatively to be able to predict contact in some other way. And then also we need a better handle on what's going on within the host, right? We take these hosts, we don't, you know, like when I work on megafauna, right? So we catch an animal, we get one cross-sectional sample, we can we're not calibrated to forecast disease dynamics well or or internal state well within the animal. And so we don't know how susceptibility is varying. So I think that in my mind at least the information gaps surrounding where everyone else is and what's actually happening in the animal seem like way bigger um obstacles than improved remote sensing. However, maybe there's a way to remotely sense moving animals without instrumenting them. That would be awesome.",

Um and and the point about again, sorry, sorry, harp on migration bit, but the point about radar detection I think is a really exciting area for at least getting a sense of um when animals leave or when they arrive, right? We can pick that up now on our radar systems and so that's I think a really promising area for making larger scale forecasts than we could based on the idea of, you know, let's put lightweight tags on every single bird or bat or something that we can.",

And I wish there was a way that we could track individual animals based on the blood meals in these mosquitoes because I think I know like in the Everglades, they've done this where they've detected the presence of certain critters that they're looking for because they're looking at these blood meals and it helps them to monitor the populations that are present. So I mean, I think there is a possibility with using blood engorged insects to do some degree of monitoring, but I don't know how useful that is for small scale movement.",

But I agree that you said the big challenge is how can you translate from individual studies and and settings to a trend of mobility, exposure and and I guess emergence. Um and there are good studies. We did work with uh dogs in Tanzania trying to understand how SIV is jumping from domestic animals to chimpanzees. So we had to individually track all the dogs and see that they had common areas in the, you know, crop area next to the park where the chimpanzees are going and the dogs are meeting. So maybe it's not that much individual animals, but it's patterns that lead you to areas where these encounters occur and that's what really you should care about, you know, more than the individual tracks.",

So that's something I've been debating. It seems maybe there's a question of scale in the kind of like how you model and understand the movement process. Like if you go really fine scale, it seems you'll have a lot more actionable information and like maybe how to like you'll be able to build disease modeling on disease models on top of it and predict and even simulate different management. But it seems if we're if we're trying to even go at well, where will the next uh uh zone zone just like emerge in the global south. I don't think maybe we don't need uh like really fine scale understanding of movement and it's more almost a distribution problem like species distribution and like overlap with humans type of question that we need to to get at.",

The other thing I I kind of hear everyone kind of also sort of maybe almost using that as a reference point but stretching toward this idea, you know, toward the the fuzzier picture of you know, what types of data, what framework do we need for a you know, maybe something in the context of much larger scale, continental to global surveillance. And you know, I I kind of feel like what you're reaching for there is some level of abstraction. Because when you when you get up there, you're not going to be dealing with individual animals. You know, it's not going to be I think as we all recognize, it's not going to be feasible to track every single animal on the continent. But you know, what what is it that would be the most useful? You know, would it be, you know, just throwing out one example off the top of my head, is it, you know, much better uh, you know, detailed maps of key migration routes, being able to understand, you know, the timing of migration, how they might light up earlier or later in different years. Um, you know, when particular species might be moving, how those might be shifting from year to year.

I mean there's thousands of thousands of animals um and people who are working them on a daily basis. And then wildlife I'd be concerned with hunters, um hunters interaction with animals, possibilities for disease transmission. I know like brucelosis case there was a hunter who made cut his skin while he was field dressing the deer and so I think there's a lot of different interaction points to take into consideration.

Um, and it really, you know, makes me think about how, you know, climate and different things are changing and they're um, you know, we're getting more of these natural disasters and they're they're coming and they're changing everything that we've known or that has been stable over the time. Um, and, you know, how how are we going to be able to understand or predict we can we're not going to be able to tell necessarily that um, you know, there's going to be a drought here or there's going to be a wildfire that's going to make all the animals run out or, you know, different things like that. But if we can understand how their movements change during those um, times and and that's I I don't know. I think so in my group at the lab we do a lot with machine learning and it's very hard for me to to step away from that right now, but um, I think the more examples of different scenarios and and data that we can get to kind of feed the models to help them understand how things change and what those um, changes will do, I think will end up much more successful. Um, I don't think we need constant monitoring of everything, but I think if we have a good baseline in most of the um, circumstances that could happen which is, you know, hard to do because natural events aren't predictable um, to know to tag all those animals at that time. predict the unpredictable.

So if you kind of imagine it where you have, you know, a bunch of like like nodes on the landscape. Maybe they're farms um or ponds or something that's very discrete where you can say, well, we have something happening within these within this farm. Um but then we might not necessarily know what's happening within that farm or maybe we don't care all that much about finding the details what's happening within that farm. But understanding the connectivity between those nodes is something that would be slightly more feasible. Um both from obviously from a farm standpoint that's very feasible because you know what cows moving from farm A to farm B. But then also in wildlife if you if you have a population that's structured like that more of a kind of standard meta population. Um you can use, you know, potentially genetic tools where you only need to sample a few individuals to understand something about connectivity between those nodes. But that begins I think to break down when you don't have that like nice partitioning, which in a lot of wildlife systems you don't. So then I'm then I think that scale becomes harder to bridge. But I think there's some cases where you could bridge that scale by sort of saying, well, I don't care too much what's happening within the node, maybe things are generally well mixed, but I can use targeted surveillance to figure out what's happening kind of between nodes.",

And so I don't think necessarily that we need to um, you know, come up with one solution, how do you deal with the the middle man. there's a potential of, you know, looking at the smaller scale and that feeding into something that's looking at the higher scale. Um, just for example, um, you know, the things that I'm working on, the machine learning models are able to determine when a disease may appear in a location first, but it doesn't really tell you anything about how it's going to move and things like that. And so then you apply, you know, some type of say mechanistic model that can um help you better understand those patterns there.",

Um, but they they had like um features that describe social context, they had features describing like your turning angle to get to your longest view shed and like all these kind of like clever features that might be, you know, that you could broadly extract from Movebank and then do some kind of like I think you could do something really cool on the machine learning front. It wouldn't I don't know Mark that that would get to like the macroecology of movement in the way that you were thinking about it. It was definitely not how Becker answered.

Like Ian Cousins got like five of these going um on like big systems, megafauna systems. Um, and yeah, I I mean I think we don't I don't think we know like the extent to which social and spatial factors compete to drive movement. But um, I think there's I think it's coming. I think it's coming out of machine learning. I don't think it's coming out of conventional statistical inference because I just I think those problems are too hard.
