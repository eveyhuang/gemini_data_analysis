I'm also interested in the in the microbiome as more of a biomarker as you noted um Judith um with this idea that many autoimmune diseases have environmental components that lead to autoimmunity but the mechanisms by which those environmental changes lead to immune changes and disease is not clear. And for me the microbiome has always stood in that space where it seems a plausible intermediate. So you have environmental change environmental exposures could lead to changes in the gut microbial or or not necessarily the gut but microbial communities within or on the body which could then in turn um mitigate certain immune changes and and disease.

So that's I think that's a widely used to kind of establish causality, but I think as Judith was suggesting it's highly reductive. I mean, you can't the environmental factors, the composition of the microbiome, all of that is um on a much more simplistic level than what you would ever encounter in a human population.

Um, we chose bute as sort of a first pass because it was something that we could well, it wasn't super easy. We made six different genetic for knockouts and a bunch of other pathways to plop into E coli, but it was sort of a just a proof of concept because of the um the importance of bute. But again, what we and the reason I kind of brought this up is because this is something I ran into is that where does there need to be bute, right? These guys, where do these guys colonize? They colonize in the small intestine, right? Uh, most of the bute is probably being made in the in the in the distal colon, right?

There's just so many zeros um in the data sets because there's a lot of presence absence situations and even like RNA a lot of people will leverage techniques that were developed for RNA sequencing um and they'll try to apply that to the microbiome data sets but the structure of the data is different enough that that's questionable whether that's appropriate to do. And so some of the tech some of the math that people will apply to microbiome data sets is suspect for false positives, especially when it comes down to saying, oh, we know there's more enisil in this person and less in this other person or the other group. Um it's just on that specific presence absence type of questions. So I think that again, I am not a computational person, but the need for robust and kind of a standard in the field in terms of the computational methodologies to compare presence absence and level of presence um is an area of need at least in describing.

Um, I just wonder if there's a way to agree on um specific inflammatory molecules, specific inflammatory pathways that need to be a beginning start across all of those different disciplines and like obviously the con to that is you could be missing some major things but to bring multiple fields together um, do we want to just look at this proinflammatory cyto.

So what's the like how similar do they need to be and do we need tens of thousands with a single technique because we're in for a world of herd if that's the case um or could we get with hundreds and could we combine technique what do you think Ron?

Um is it going to be just you know one microbe and each microbe is independently has an effect size or is it just this microbe that they have to be combined and have interaction between them. So this would all depend I think I don't know my my feeling based on nothing but just a feeling based on what we know from genetics is it's probably going to be in the thousands to get you know strong replicable um signals. Um and you know and the in genetics right the sample sizes now to look at some of the like diseases and phenotypes that have um many genes associated with them now they're looking at you know 500,000 sample size 500,000 or a million um or more and you keep finding more things right? You still keep finding more and more things that have very small effect sizes. Um so it's it's kind of unlimited you know. It's possible that every microbe has some kind of a role and that role is very small and for some microbes it's very very small and in that case you're going to need you know huge sample sizes yeah.",
