Um, I did my PhD working with bacteria that can respire chlorinated solvents and what they do is they take out the chlorines and they make these solvents not toxic anymore and this is used, this is used for bioremediation. There are cultures with these microbes. If you take the single microbe which is the alcoides and have the microbe do the the reaction which destroys this pollutant, the microbe is very slow if it's in pure culture.

Archea such as methanogens, viruses with some eukaryotic viruses, but mostly oh that's supposed to say phage. Um, fungi, helmets, protists, dot dot dot other stuff too. Uh and host cell populations are all part of this community that contribute to the emergent properties.
