Yeah, so I'm assistant professor uh at University of Illinois uh at Urbana Champagne just like uh Kai. Uh I have appointment in chemistry and neuroscience program. Uh so in my lab we have uh kind of like two big directions. One of them is to probe synaptic neurochemistry uh where we are developing a nanoscale electrode uh that can be positioned at synapses using scanning electrochemical microscopy. Uh we also have a second direction where we are developing uh implantable electrodes um for sensing um selective uh group of neurochemicals that are involved in cognitive activities. I call them like glad, like a GL means glutamate, A means acetocoling. Uh D like dopamine. Um so uh yeah, so so this is like you know another big direction and we also have interest in Alzheimer's disease as well as Parkinson's disease. Uh where my long-term passion is really to explore the effect of environmental pollutants on the brain activity. Um yeah, I haven't taught like environmental chemistry for several years at UIUC, which is a fantastic experience. So yeah, the class has grew a lot. Initially we have like maybe 130 students then eventually 180 students it just keep growing so yeah.",

And I said, should be okay, there is a control. He said, no, the uh the 16S has no internal control and for the first time I realized that the uh amplicon base and as we speak is still the case, there is no internal uh control.

And uh and and in fact it may be true because there are so many layer of intestinal barrier that to me indicate that our host knows how important it is. You have a physical barrier which is the non steer water layer and mucus which by the way the mucus can be disrupted because of the bacteria, there are a bunch of bacteria that are mucolytic. Then you've got immune barriers primarily IGA dependent and then you have got the structure barrier which is intestinal epithelial and primarily through the paracellular path that between the epithelial cells that's regulated by apical junctional complex that can be uh those protein can be disrupted and cause a leach and that disruption is either through oxidative stress or uh cyto compact which clearly get uh disrupted or regulated by bacterial product.",

The way we do it, we do it with a sugar test. Uh we uh give patients or in animals a cocktail of poly absorb sugar which is manitol uh lactulose and sucralose and sucralose is is a modified sucrose that is got a chloride next to it and the benefit of it is neither human or bacteria can ferment it. For it can be all over in the colon and you can measure it and you look at the urine and higher the um levels in the urine leakier the intestine is. Uh and then through the immunohisto chemistry uh we showed that is associated with oxidative stress. We define it with the uh the positive nitrotyrosine and also uh penetration of um E coli associated LPS in the tissue as well as uh increase LPS binding protein in the serum. Uh subsequently couple of studies shows that in human there is in Parkinson they have got disruption of intestinal barrier. We subsequently showed it in animal model of Parkinson is primarily uh that there is disruption of intestinal barrier oxidative stress and that appears to be TLR4 pathway because in TLR4 knockout mice the barrier was protected. Um and more recently we haven't published that we are using organoids uh from patient with Parkinson and control and uh we use um dextran and also we stained for uh tight junctional protein which by the way in human tissue we show that are disrupted. In organoids from patient with Parkinson they have uh disruption of the barrier and disruption of the tight junctional protein.",

There is no doubt that is a the gut brain access is not single path is a bidirectional path and in fact it can create a vicious cycle. the question is when is going to start. Now, I trained my postgraduate at Guys with Start with where the Parkinson uh uh practice and one of my fun during the lunchtime was to go to the library and read the original uh description Addison Sterling and Parkinson very humbling. The Parkinson William Parkinson is exceptional clinician the description of his phenotype without having MRI or JP that didn't have you and it was exceptional. But the point is Parkinson I think is a syndrome. It's not a single disease and therefore there are going to be type of patients that maybe start from the gut, they some come from the brain, but the creation of the vicious cycle that is going to sustain it. I I I know that my view is is a no no in a study section. I get irritated when people say is it a uh trigger. I said why should I care whether is a trigger or is perpetuated because you need to",
