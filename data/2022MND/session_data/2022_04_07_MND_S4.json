Um, I don't really know much about how much has been done in terms of the role of microbiome in this process. If there has been studies any like in in mice or in human patients with germ free versus, you know, antibiotic I don't I don't really know if anything has been done in that space, but I know that there's a lot of cross talk between tissue components there and all of those tissue components could be targeted by microbial factors directly or indirectly. there's a lot to unpack there for sure.",

So uh the question now is uh so so once you come up uh come up with a driver and then a trigger, the question is like uh to what extent it's uh it's really affected and then uh if that will leave lead to uh any physiology. So that's something that we are trying to explore and like how big is that uh change and you can go with different particles and so on, you can figure out uh what size molecules can actually get into the brain, right? Which is important as well. So I I couldn't find I couldn't find very much a lot of work on that. Uh so so we had to design some systems but uh but I'm I'm looking actively to find good work in that area and to kind of follow up uh so if you guys because we are very new, you know, I worked a lot on the gut barrier but not the blood brain barrier.

Um with respect to the correlation versus association, the best one that I know of is IBD where you can measure permeability defects in patients before they become IBD patients if you'll do a screen.

Um as we've looked at stroke models more closely, it's not just inflammation in the parenchyma but uh it seems like a a large portion of those immune cells are coming from from the meninges and uh it's one of these areas where there's fenestrated uh on the Venus side so it's one of these areas that are very open uh to potentially either metabolites or to uh endotoxins things like that coming from uh from the gut. And there there's just some really interesting observations there. For instance, if you get inflammation and upregulation of IGA in the gut, it also corresponds with increased IGA production uh in the dural layer. Um so it's kind of this co-evolutionary idea that it's it's in the benefit of the organism to if something gets across the epithelial barrier to also be able to recognize that at the brain um and respond in a very rapid way whether that be uh plasma cells which are migrating sensitize in the gut and then migrating into these these areas in the meninges that then have pretty free access to get across to the brain.
