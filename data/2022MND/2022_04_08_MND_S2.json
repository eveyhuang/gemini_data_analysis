There is always some wires like sticking out. So how you can implant it and also have the data communication circuit combined with that sensing modality.

Uh it has been, you know, this idea has been around actually for a long time. I remember I was a student and this smart pill thing was mentioned multiple times, but I haven't seen any really advancement and real thing rather than some passive components that they can go through and sample, sample like for example, go to intestine and sample bacteria, then the human or the subject um excrete that and then they collect the sample and do the traditional analysis, you know? But something that for example, can do all this screening, even simplest electrical screening and give the signal out because you see in our body we cannot stick wires out. That's the thing. With brain, that's as at least like to some extent you say it's here, it doesn't move, that's another big problem. It doesn't move, it is fixed. So even if there are some wires coming out, that's still okay. But how are you going to do that with, you know, with the like our stomach or our intestine, you know?
