So so um in in terms of in terms of thinking about the diversity of the taxa that are associated with C elegance in the wild, but then also what what overlap are there with with the taxa that are present in the in the human microbiome. And so for C elegance is primarily gram negative uh either aerobes or or facultative anaerobes. Um and so yeah, we we sort of look at it this way is there's there's in terms of how it relates to human biology is there's two areas I guess that we sort of think about is is at the microbial strain level where what what levels of overlap are there there. And then like Annika was mentioning um what are the where are there conservation in in sort of molecular targets. And so are there conservations in receptors or receptor families. So in C elegance we have we have conserved monoamine receptor families, cannabinoid receptor families, opioid receptor families and in some cases those can be uh uh activated by similar ligands where those are sort of activated in in in mammals. But um in other cases there's not going to be overlap and we're sort of interested in the ecology in those cases.",

Um, the other advantage that, um, that I think about as somebody who's interested in aging, um, is that they while most people think flies live a pretty short time, they do live up to three months. Um, however, you know, we can look at aging on a much more rapid time scale than you can in other animal models. So we can we can do some of these manipulations in young and middle aged and older flies and follow them out, um, and kind of look at, um, at more complex, uh, uh, sort of environmental things than what you can feasibly do at a large scale in mammals. So for example, we can, you know, I've designed systems where we're looking, you know, at animals that are in a light cycle, in a temperature cycle, on several different food substrates across a lifespan, you know, all together with multiple genotypes, um, in a pretty high throughput way that's hard to do in other model systems.",

So, like the example that comes to mind is a disease called Smith Lemley Opitz syndrome where, um, patients are, um, unable to synthesize cholesterol, so they get the the pathway gets stuck at seven dehydrocholesterol, which is considered somewhat toxic. Um, so I'm curious, but mice, so even though they biochemically have this disorder, they can like revert back and like somehow still live and and be okay over time, like they don't get the accumulation. So do you see this in lower order model systems in terms of like the microbiome, like if you introduce a microbiome, like that that that the animal itself somehow like, I don't want to say like corrects, because I don't know that it's right, but changes.",

So I I was talking about this with someone else who said that like overall the the number or the amount of microbes in breast milk is really hard to measure because it's very low so it's hard to do like analysis of the constituent components. Um but sort of the the ratios of like basic, you know, proteins, fats, um uh microbes etc had this um circadian variability in um in humans as does, you know, total production volume. Um and that this was correlated with some metabolic um demands of infants around the circadian day in a way that was really fascinating to me as sort of an ongoing maternal care microbiome interaction.",

So we showed that you could take the microbiome from the breeding colony mouse, put it into the Jax mouse and make the Jax mouse resistant. And even narrowed it down to four there were four particular taxa um and you had to have those together, but that matched what the fecal transplant did.
