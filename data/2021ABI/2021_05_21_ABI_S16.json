I do and many people complain saying that I'm just creating a stress to the host or the micro by changing the circadian. Yes, that is the biological uh uh stress. For the stress to me is change in homeostatic environment of the organism. Um and I like the idea of one of you said that the uh stress in one species can result in the stress in the others although environment may not be stressful for one species and could be with other and interactions. Okay. when you are discussing it, you have to just actually be clear in our mind, what do we mean with the stress. Now what do you think the impact of a stress whatever you're going to define it is on micro and micro signaling and micro host interactions. Anyone.",

Um might be one way to start to get a handle on this because I guess from what I'm what I'm gathering from the conversation is there are just so many different types of stress, so many different types of stress response that we're thinking about that we need to kind of start to define, okay, which ones do we want to look at, how do we look at them? Um which is all its own kind of question, like how do you define which which stress is the most important on a microbe? Oxidative stress seems like a reasonable place to start just based on leaky gut and what we know about oxidative stress and um metabolism, but I guess that's what I'm trying to run through that.",

Oxidative stress is one of them, I guess this is one of common stressors to many things. Uh either this is the uh the short chain amino acid break down and also fragmented polypeptide mitochondria and all the bacteria changes bioflu to change the all create the oxidative stress. But I I I thought it's stress is really depends on the model we're studying, you know, if we're studying and the neurodegenerative disease and what the stress will be and uh in for the GI uh the GI disease and what the what the stress we should actually study or focus. Uh that is what I thought, you know, we cannot include all the stressors to one model or one case one case and I think this really really need to tailor which model we're going to use or what condition we're going to study.",

But that is one model that you can experimentally take advantage and also see how you can disrupt it. How about the other models to look at the the host related uh uh stress example PTSD. We know the PTSD cause microbial changes. What do you think? So how do you decide which model you are going to use anyone?",

Um different uh kind of expression in in different states of bacteria. So for example, the bacteria that you culture in lab that might be um, you know, planktonic or swimming will have a different genetic signature than one that would be grown as a biofilm in lab.

But um also one limitation with those other than other environmental factors is you may not sample all cell types, like it can be depending on how you in our case, depending on how you grow them and differentiate them, you may not get like the parietal cells that are the acid secreting acid secreting cells that are relevant for like pH stress. Um, and I think the points that have been made now by Chris and Carolina and others about like the need for genetic tools are very good. Um, in the absence of those, we might have to think about more global interventions, um, with small molecules or things. Again, it depends on the type of stress and it's taking kind of a sledgehammer approach because it's not a very precise mechanism, but if you're thinking about pH stress or oxidative stress, are there small molecule modulators, um, you know, I previously worked with vibrio cholera a lot and for a lot of those animal models, the way you get them to work is to dose the rabbit with an antacid to enable a relaxation of the bottleneck of the stomach so you get reliable colonization of the intestine. So are there things like that that can address major bottlenecks in the host that affect microbial growth and colonization. It's just an idea.",

And then we talked about host stress like in PTSD, um Alzheimer disease or others. Then we talked about engineering in um genetics, for example, non model species maybe or organite type models, mass models and combining the physiologically relevant and reductionist approach. Um, it's important, I think Lisa mentioned it's important to make sure we are mimicking the environment properly. Um, so then we can study uh different factors in a reliable way. And uh the second question was the signals can be disrupted or intercepted as needed. How can? Can they be? So somewhere in bioengineering for probiotics. Um, I don't remember who mentioned that.

Like, you know, when our cortisol level is changing, our um um hormones like I don't know, epinephrin is changing. Um, so and those have effect in in terms of um changing how uh microbes they proliferate, right? So there is really a connection, but I don't know if we really mention them anywhere.

So we just don't know what sort of antibiotic resistance profiles certain bacteria have once we have to grow them in the lab to do all of that and then we have to figure out which plasma can go in and which plasma can integrate and things like that.
