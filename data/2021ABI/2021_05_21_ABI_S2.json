And uh the reason I think I was probably put in this group is because I I'm very interested in protein trafficking within small structures known as cilia and cilia are diffraction limited and they're really important for a lot of developmental clinical things so they they receive Sonic Hedgehog signaling and so that's really important for patterning. And what's interesting is that the cilia generally in terms of human mutations, they're not they're not abolished so they're still present but there's just minor defects in trafficking within the cilia and to the cilia. And so something that the field needs is to be able to study cilia trafficking in either a cilia that's beating because sometimes they beat back and forth to generate flow. Um that's really challenging because they can beat up to 15 to 20 hertz. So trying to image a diffraction limited spot and something that's beating at 20 hertz uh would be a challenge and so that's the kind of stuff that I'm interested in. I have the biological expertise and I can do, you know, I do fluorescence imaging and and live cell imaging and super resolution imaging and stuff like that. But um I think that that problem will need something beyond that. So thanks.",

And uh my lab is primarily interested in signal transduction that regulates cell motility. So migration of mammalian cells and uh not only of single cells but also of collective of groups of cells. So the the main challenge related to the topic of this breakout session um in the context of my research is I think to link molecular events to subcellular events and to super cellular events. So so it's kind of the we need to understand what's happening at the molecular level um what is happening with for example polymerizing acting structures um but they happen at a very very fast time scale and uh cells move at a much much slower cells time scale. So uh the the big challenge then is to to link uh these molecular events to the larger um cellular outcomes. And um I don't quite know how to do that because you know if we if we monitor on single molecules, we we can probably do that. Uh but how do we know that which molecular single event would then translate into a cell for example to polarize as a whole, which happens on the scale of tens of minutes. So that would be something to to think about. And regarding this this um other question of uh how can we uh collect simultaneous at different times of resolution. I I guess um one could think of of um imaging live cell imaging streams where you resolve where you try to monitor events at a relatively low resolution and then have online um automated image analysis that ident identifies relevant events, zooms in, goes at really high uh imaging frequency. So um this is something that we don't do but but that we that I thought could be something of interest because the technical challenges to overcome and and developing a robust workflow for for doing this.

Uh, basically, we are developing, we are developing the optical imaging platform and we integrate the Raman based microscopy such as stimulated Raman microscopy and with the multiphoton fluorescence microscopy together. So this is a multimodality imaging system, not only allow us to visualize the metabolic activities such as those small metabolites like glucose, amino acids or fatty acids, we can directly visualize them because the isotope we add onto those small metabolites will form the new chemical bond, which is, uh, for example, carbon deuterium bond, so we don't need to do click chemistry to add the bulky fluorescence probe anymore. So this layer of metabolic information, uh, can be visualized at the same time, we want to see, for example, the calcium fluorescence signal in the same region of interest. So this, uh, combined imaging platform can be used to solve some biological questions such as neurovascular coupling system.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, so so thanks for showing some interest in it. to traditionally, if you need to image cilia that are beating, which is the most challenging situation, they're beating at anywhere from 20 hertz to some extreme protist that live in the sea can beat up to 150 hertz. So that's that's a different story. And typically you're imaging them if you if you need to do temporal imaging, you need to image them at around 100 hertz to get reliable, you know, wave forms. And so we do that with DIC. So DIC microscopy with just a camera is the best way to track the ciliary wave form. Um, but then if you want to track trafficking within this bending whip like wave form, that's where you need to do fluorescence. And so what the field has done is that they've either taken cilia that are beating and immobilized them pharmacologically so that they're not beating and then tracked protein trafficking within them. But that's such a major perturbation that, you know, we still don't know what protein trafficking within a beating cilium looks like because of that. So one thing, yeah, I don't know, you know, and now you can do the combined DIC fluorescence, you know, that's not a challenging technique, but getting enough signal is then that becomes the challenge. So getting enough signal from what could be one to five proteins and part of like a particle train, um, to get enough signal from that to reliably track it within the wave form seems to be where the barrier is, if that makes any sense.",

Um, the you know, one the issue is how much is it moving in 3D in like one sort of time step, right? So that that also so let's say you needed minimum three views, I'm just guessing, you could make some technique, you know, how far is it going to displace between each of those three shots or do you need to come up with some sort of simultaneous multi focal technique, which exists, but you keep every time you do that you split the light so you're really going to need transmitted light measurements, right where your photon, your excitation photons are doing the work, not your emission photons.",

I mean that requires integrating across data modalities but it's it's pretty easy to integrate some of these label free methods in an opposing arm on the microscope and so then you could try and image that way and then switch over.

And I think there is a possibility that we do barcoding with Raman. Raman based technique. Oh, even without the barcoding technique, we can do hyperspectral hyper hyperspectral imaging with the Raman based technology. So that means if we can speed up the imaging collection, then we have a stack of image that covers a certain spectrum. So each molecule, each molecule that we want to look at have its own spectrum profile. So if the the image stack, the hyperspectral image stack have for example uh 512 multiplied by 512 pixels and each pixel have its own spectrum information covered. And that allow us to do computational algorithm to do clustering, clustering out the same similar spectrum groups of the pixels. So if group one have this same Raman spectrum, then these pixels will be assigned to uh for example red color, one color. And group two we we cluster out again and we assign different second color. And then there's no limitation as long as we can group out uh uh a group of of spectrum profile, we can assign a color for that specific group of uh molecule. So the the in the end each pixel there is a dominating molecule signal. dominating molecule signal is uh the the the final assigned color.",

So uh what I had contributed was that I also have have another simultaneous equation where um I describe the oxygen partial pressure. I would get that from the spec imaging, okay? And then uh where the oxygen partial pressure goes down to zero is where the necrosis will start in the tumor. So uh so that I can now start evolving this tumor equation with time and now the necrosis will start. So there is like I thought that that might easily translate to something that Dr. was saying because I can describe the cellular metabolism and the physical structures of the uh osteoblast and osteocytes, you know, population and I could apply it to the anybody else's cellular um like you know, all the things other things that we discussed.",

But often the if you measure say 100 cells and you perturb them and then you measure them at similar time points, you actually get very repeatable behavior often for certain gene networks. So it turns out you can actually link the snapshot data using some modeling ideas. So these come more from control theory, so they're things like chemical master equation and these other things. What's really interesting about them is you can actually predict if you take enough data what the cells might do under a new stimuli or you can predict which time points you should then measure to reduce your uncertainty. So you can do sort of a course set of experiments and then predict like where do I need to fill in to understand the dynamics of my system better.",
