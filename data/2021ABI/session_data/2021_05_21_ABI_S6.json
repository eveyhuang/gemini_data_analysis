Uh the other interest could be looking at multimodality. We are also interested in near infrared optical imaging which is through just blood uh vasculature. Uh so one of the long-term goals could also be to think about multimodality systems and could there be contrast agents which would play play the strength of two modalities at once.

Um so the dyes have to be quite bright. Um and the problem is if you want to, you know, it'd be great. we're looking at like ratiometric imaging next to be able to get um, you know, a more precise read and more quantitative. The problem is is then you got to go back and change all the clinical systems and there are now, you know, 5,000, 6,000 robots around the world. So there's definitely an instrumentation issue. Like where the image the the issue is the cost is really high for the camera systems. Um so it's really hard to get a company like a big company like Intuitive to move on something um unless there's really a clear clear benefit because they're going to have to go back through the FDA process and go modify out all their instruments. Um but it can happen. It just has to be really good.",

So um one thing that I that that I think about a lot is that um at least for nanoparticles, there's an abundance of all sorts of variants of contrast agents for nanoparticles whether it be uh positron emission tomography, MRI, etc etc. Um but at least because I focus more on the optical side, the ratiometric part is a lot more important. I mean you you talk about protease activity, we talk about um uh cancer cell specific internalization to activate therapeutics which are also fluorescent. So my question I'm I guess posing to the group is that aside from the contrast agent development, the concept of using multiplexed imaging or ratiometric imaging specifically with respect to to hyperspectral mixing etc. What's the bottleneck to moving that into the clinic because if you're already doing ratiometric in in patients then what's what's left in terms of pushing those boundaries?",

But if you push it further down, uh it could be in a different regime and I don't know, I have no idea how one would make go about this. I'm just giving some ideas for people who know how to make materials. Uh on the other hand, I think well if you're in your excitement is in the X-ray regime, well you're you still have ionization.

So you need a really, really good question to motivate solving that problem. I mean, one way that's a little bit simpler conceptual, I guess is if you have the same probes, you can use for example, like X-ray fluorescence as a ground truth read out at the end stage of an experiment where you may have some kind of a temporal uh imaging or sensing ability over a time course. So and then you can kind of ground truth it at the end. So those combinations I think uh are probably a little bit simpler and easier to justify uh building those kinds of contrast agents.",

So if you have a protease that's on in your cancer, but the problem is that protease is also present in normal tissue. Uh you can get some contrast, but you can't get great contrast. But if you add now a second signal that only is present the two of them together in the tumor and not in normal tissue, um you get a very specific signal and that's worked really well for us for optical. We can find multiple proteases that are sort of only on together in in in that environment. But you could do it with anything, right? Like a protease and pH or oxygen levels and something. What what are people's thoughts about that and the potential applications in in uh nanoparticles? Like is that something that could be engineered into nanoparticles into a single nanoparticle to respond to multiple inputs?",

So for all our MR applications, we don't try to load up AV because it's it's just too small of a load. But there's a lot of genetic encoding and adding into the AAV genome uh part of the genome that will then express a contrast agent where it's been integrated and they do that for iron uh deposition and or iron contrast based agents. Uh in terms of though going back to your immune cells, um it is in a sense fairly straightforward I believe to track immune cells by MRI and that could be applied to spinal cord injury and you could do that with either iron oxides or fluorine. If you would want quantitative then fluorine would be the way to go. It's just not very well established in the clinic yet.",

So I I think it's a a very important point that you've raised is sort of using more biocompatible or biological delivery nanoparticles and to me that would be a very, you know, the next 10 years is going to be filled with a lot of that of taking concepts from the last 10 years but then packaging them up ways now that you can achieve more exquisite targeting to sites, blood brain barrier, CNS barrier and things like that.",

So if you're going to add imaging to it, it can't be more than $50,000. So, so there's all sorts of commercial issues and, you know, nanoparticles are multi component. So if you in the rules of FDA approval, you've now got to get each component approved and then there's all sorts of questions about whether it's a drug or whether it's a device. So there's an entire world of complexity that I think a lot of the researchers in the field are not familiar with. And um",
