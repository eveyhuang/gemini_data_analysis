So um I also have worked on spect uh and uh quite extensively spect and one thing like sorry like gun to the head I the only thing I can remember that is uh you can do simultaneously um multiple modalities. So um so for example, interferometry is giving you attenuation and uh phase and uh scatter images completely different three physical uh properties simultaneously because you're able to capture the phase shift and scatter and you can do it with uh different radio tracers for um multi tracers for pet um pet imaging for example, you know, at different energies um for the same detector and um so that's that's what comes to my head quickly and uh if somebody thinks it's useful. I lack the biological part so if somebody gives me a problem I can think about it. Thank you.",

And uh the reason I think I was probably put in this group is because I I'm very interested in protein trafficking within small structures known as cilia and cilia are diffraction limited and they're really important for a lot of developmental clinical things so they they receive Sonic Hedgehog signaling and so that's really important for patterning. And what's interesting is that the cilia generally in terms of human mutations, they're not they're not abolished so they're still present but there's just minor defects in trafficking within the cilia and to the cilia. And so this has only been studied so far for the most part, the hardcore trafficking stuff has only been studied in static cells that aren't moving or in cilia that aren't moving but in a developing organism clearly they are moving. And so something that the field needs is to be able to study cilia trafficking in either a cilia that's beating because sometimes they beat back and forth to generate flow. Um that's really challenging because they can beat up to 15 to 20 hertz. So trying to image a diffraction limited spot and something that's beating at 20 hertz uh would be a challenge and so that's the kind of stuff that I'm interested in. I have the biological expertise and I can do, you know, I do fluorescence imaging and and live cell imaging and super resolution imaging and stuff like that. But um I think that that problem will need something beyond that. So thanks.",

And uh my lab is primarily interested in signal transduction that regulates cell motility. So migration of million cells and uh not only of single cells but also of collectives of groups of cells. So the the main challenge related to the topic of this breakout session um in the context of my research is I think to link molecular events to subcellular events and to super cellular events. So so it's kind of the we need to understand what's happening at the molecular level um what is happening with for example polymerizing acting structures um but they happen at a very very fast time scale and uh cells move at a much much slower cells time scale. So uh the the big challenge then is to to link uh these molecular events to the larger um cellular outcomes. And um I don't quite know how to do that because you know if we if we monitor on single molecules we we can probably do that. Um but how do we know that which molecular signal event would then translate into a cell for example to polarize as a whole which happens on the scale of tens of minutes. So that would be something to to think about. And regarding this this um other question of uh how can we collect simultaneously at different times of resolution I I guess um one could think of of um imaging live cell imaging streams where you resolve where you try to monitor events at a relatively low resolution and then have online um automated image analysis that ident identifies relevant events zooms in goes at really high uh imaging frequency so um this is something that we don't do but but that we that I thought could be something of interest of course the technical challenges to overcome and and developing a robust workflow for for doing this.

I was trained as a molecularologist and uh worked in a biophysical lab on super resolution imaging on virus host interactions. So my lab uh I built a single molecule of polarization microscope to look at uh virus uh life cycle. Uh so far I have um so one of my question is uh when the virus replicates on the ER structure close to the nuclei uh nuclei and we uh by so our super resolution microscopy lose the ability to uh resolve those uh replication complex uh in 3D. So we can only do kind of turf. Uh so I'm hoping that uh if there's some methods that we can we can we can we can uh see those very small structures deep in the cell uh with high contrast. So I know that there are tradeoffs between um spatial resolution and the photo uh phototoxicity and as well as the floor for um you know, photon budget. So I think maybe a new floor for um uh that would be helpful and also uh adaptive imaging, for example, that you only uh activate the floor for that on your focal point will all the others uh you do not activate. So that's uh some uh some thoughts I have. Uh and also I am uh uh I really like to look at the dynamics of the virus moving um on the surface of the cells or moving from the inside to the out of the cells. So uh the challenge in here would be the temporal resolution. So um so far we use uh millisecond resolution to track the viruses, but I think there are some very tiny or detailed movements of these virus on the cell surface before they enter or before they enter the cells. So uh and also because virus are so small, they're like 100 to between 100 to 200 nanometers. So then that will require uh high spatial and temporal resolution to resolve those questions. So those are my thoughts on that.",

And so I use microscopy because it's a great system to observe neural activity and I use small transgenic or small transparent fish species so that we can observe activity across the brain and uh without any kind of surgery using uh fluorescent sensors of neural activity like voltage or calcium. And one thing that I think is really important that neuroscience in general is trying to get at is how to link multiple levels of uh looking at the brain such as looking at the activity or the anatomy or what cells are connected to each other or what genes they express. And it's difficult to look at all these with the same method. So I've, you know, worked on some uh approaches to try and register different types of data together so we can look at the same cells under different conditions where we'll look at live uh neural activity imaging in an animal that's behaving and then we take the same animal, we fix it and we do, you know, multiple rounds of in situ hybridization to look at the genes expressed in those same cells using image registration to merge our live brain onto the fixed brain. And I'm really interested in kind of pushing that forward and seeing how many different types of data of imaging data we can merge together to try and link some of these different temporal and spatial domains. So using the tradeoffs of different types of microscopy in live tissue versus say fixed tissue where we can zoom in a lot more and look at, you know, single molecule gene expression and so forth. And so I'm I'm interested to see what what sorts of um imaging modalities we can apply to look at these other levels of organization in the brain and and what sorts of uh registration approaches would be best to merge very different types of data.",

Um so the imaging techniques um that we have to use are often really challenging. Um my lab specifically looks or has recently started to look at the effects of cell metabolism and how that actually drives um skeletal regeneration. Currently um it's fairly difficult to look at that in terms of we just started looking in terms of spatial transcriptomics and then um high plex proteomics, but really what you're looking at is um, you know, transcript before the enzyme or protein but not knowing if the enzyme is active. And so trying to look at different ways beyond Seahorse analytics, which is going to be an ex vivo analysis, um both spatially and over time in vivo would be incredibly useful to the field. Um and I think it would probably hold a lot of answers. So I'm really just here to see again what sort of imaging modalities which I think somebody else mentioned can be applied to the field.

Uh basically we are developing, we are developing the optical imaging platform and we integrate the Raman based microscopy such as stimulated Raman microscopy and with the multiphoton fluorescence microscopy together. So this is a multimodality imaging system not only allow us to visualize the metabolic activities such as those small metabolites like glucose, amino acids or fatty acids, we can directly visualize them because the isotope we add onto those small metabolites will form the new chemical bond, which is uh for example carbon deuterium bond, so we don't need to do click chemistry to add the bulky fluorescence probe anymore. So this layer of metabolic information uh can be visualized at the same time we want to see for example the calcium fluorescence signal in the same region of interest. So this uh combined imaging platform can be used to solve some biological questions such as neurovascular coupling system. Uh for example we we are so interested in how neuron talk to those other type of cells such as endothelial cells on the vasculature system like the the uh blood brain barrier for example. So uh another layer of information that we couldn't really uh image because of the technical limitation is how the endothelial cell from the vasculature system signaling back to the the neuron and uh how these like feedback uh feedbacks the circuits that work. So uh if we combine both the Raman based imaging with the multiphoton fluorescence imaging together then we can visualize both layers of information at the same time specially and temporarily for in vivo imaging.",

So that's that's a different story. And typically you're imaging them if you if you need to do temporal imaging, you need to image them at around 100 hertz to get reliable, you know, wave forms. And so we do that with DIC. So DIC microscopy with just a camera is the best way to track the ciliary wave form. Um, but then if you want to track trafficking within this bending whip like wave form, that's where you need to do fluorescence. And so what the field has done is that they've either taken cilia that are beating and immobilized them pharmacologically so that they're not beating and then track protein trafficking within them, but that's such a major perturbation that, you know, we still don't know what protein trafficking within a beating cilium looks like because of that. So one thing, yeah, I don't know, you know, now you can do the combined DIC fluorescence, you know, that's not a challenging technique, but getting enough signal is then that becomes the challenge. So getting enough signal from what could be one to five proteins and part of like a particle train, um, to get enough signal from that to reliably track it within the wave form would seem to be what would be needed.",

I mean there are ones that aren't, but um, typically you need to introduce some sort of diversity in the phase so then you can extract, you know, what the refracted index was. So you need to look at the image somehow in with multiple views. So this can be pretty low though for certain techniques and so the frame rate can still get pretty high. Um, the you know, one the issue is how much is it moving in 3D in like one sort of time step, right? So that that also so let's say you needed minimum three views, I'm just guessing, you know, you could make some technique, you know, how far is it going to displace between each of those three shots or do you need to come up with some sort of simultaneous multifocal technique, which exists. But you keep every time you do that you split the light, so you're really going to need transmitted light measurements, right where your photon, your excitation photons are doing the work, not your emission photons. Um, so I do think the QPA stuff is is definitely a really promising way to go there, but it does typically require some sort of re computational recombination of multiple views.",

I think it's it's generally like a wide field approach because we do want the most number of photons and we want speed. So camera based wide field analysis is kind of the standard approach. And so, you know, we're we're we could label brighter, we could try to, you know, you know, I guess wide field with deconvolution would probably be the next step. So just to do simple deconvolution would probably be the next step, but beyond that, I I don't know where the photons. I don't know, you know, we can try just going brighter.

Um, now with a CMOS camera is again very increasing a bit the field of view and the throughput, um but it's a couple of cells at a time. And that um, you know, limits you in terms of um, you know, if you have rare populations in your sample, will you ever sample them um in your imaging if you're only imaging 10 cells in and again it's a slow imaging modality, you image one cell in every uh, you know, 20 minutes, 15 minutes, um something like that. And so, um, you know, one approach is again like make it automated so that you can image um thousands of cells um automatically. Um, and again randomly sample or maybe a more sort of intelligent approach would be uh maybe there are low resolution features that, you know, um mark those rare populations that you can um find um with a higher throughput approach then you can assume it to those with high resolution uh right rather than just randomly sampling and hoping you will find one of those cells in your in your image.

So, how hard is it to know if the event in your case, I guess specifically, I know generalizing is difficult, um that the event would have started occurring if you had a label free measurement that was lower resolution and then you could switch over to doing some sort of super res. I mean that requires integrating across data modalities, but it's it's pretty easy to integrate some of these label free methods in an opposing arm on the microscope. And so then you could try and image that way and then switch over. So, but the question is, will you actually know it's happening with a label free method if you don't have the molecular readout and I don't know if that's the case or not.",

But perhaps you would like to know what five or 10 different things are doing in a specific event. So what we've come up with is is try to make cells behave in a very stereotypic way. For example, move along a a track of extracellular matrix which then has a turn. So you can have a cell that migrates along that track and then it has to turn and then you can especially temporarily analyze what's happening during this specific turning process. And then you have different cells, you you don't use the same cell but you use different cells in a stereotypical behavior um to register the different molecular events uh over time. So that's that's something that, you know, we're we're trying to um establish more and there there certainly with with microfabrication there's there ways of of uh forcing cells into specific behaviors and and helping with that issue. goes back to this multiplexing uh problem of spatial temporal analysis.",

But if you wanted to label something like say a cilium so that you could identify it with fluorescence and then image the cilium with Raman, how can you separate out the fluorescence from the Raman signal?

So other fluorescence signal can be uh can be imaged by two photon fluorescence very well. For example the the the one that we usually talk about like label free NADH or flavor molecules and we can quickly just image with two photon fluorescence in the same you know even same region of interest.

We there's we have this inexplicable we're working on an aged mouse model and so I think the the pictures up on the on the picture board or whatever, but you know, I get this higher bone mineral density and the regenerated bone. It's direct ossification. There's no cartilage intermediate. I get this um really high bone mineral density and it's in very specific places. And so the man handle or the woman handling of the microCT stacks and trying to actually align um where that is in relation to the histology, I can sort of reverse the spaces and then do CD31 and and say okay, that's an endothelial space but being able to correlate some of this high bone mineral density to what's around it, which presumably is either nerve or vascular space, um would actually lead to what the mechanism is that's underlying that, particularly if I can go in and sort of um look at that in terms of spatial transcriptomics and be able to say like, yeah, there's my you know, there's my vasculature and there's my osteoblast and you can see that it correlates like when we look at this in 2D. But um, we haven't been able to successfully take these CT stacks and be able to mathematically show it. I mean, I think the field hasn't really either because you end up with all these figures are just like, hey, it kind of looks like this. And then just hope somebody doesn't ask for some sort of quantification for it. You just sort of go, oh, we can't do it. Um, so but but I I think that's really needed um to be able to, you know, find out better ways to if you could do that, I mean, you could basically target where you where you want to interosseous growth for like prosthetic integration and stuff, which would be really nice.",

But often the if you measure say 100 cells and you perturb them and then you measure them at similar time points, you actually get very repeatable behavior often for certain gene networks. So it turns out you can actually link the snapshot data using some modeling ideas. So these come more from control theory, so they're things like chemical master equation and these other things. What's really interesting about them is you can actually predict if you take enough data what the cells might do under a new stimuli or you can predict which time points you should then measure to reduce your uncertainty. So you can do sort of a coarser set of experiments and then predict like where do I need to fill in to understand the dynamics in my system better. And we actually showed that you can do this well enough where you can extract say um elongation rates of RNA from these snapshot data. So then we went back into the line system and actually measured the elongation rate and actually showed we got it right from the computational inference. The the problem we run into there again is we just started with an overwhelming amount of data. So we're stuck to this idea of like, can we it's really easy to start from this overwhelming data, specify a model and say I should have measured here. I think it gets much harder to start from a sort of first principles modeling and say this is where I need to be doing my measurements to learn the most over space and time and that problem I think is is still really challenging and I don't have a good handle on the best way to approach it.

Uh and also the uh I think the uh user guided imaging where where you uh you focus where with a with a bigger field and then you zoom in on a smaller field. That's exactly what I would looking for. And I think if we can I think that it it it definitely would help with the uh photo bleaching or photo toxicity uh problem so that with a uh bigger field we don't need we uh we kind of spread out the intensity of the of the lasers. But uh once we find an interesting field, we can zoom it in then we only look at that small part and look at it at super resolution and that way we can keep the cell alive while we're imaging.
