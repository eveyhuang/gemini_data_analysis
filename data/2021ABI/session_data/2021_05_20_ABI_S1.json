But what we've like it's just I I'd interested if anybody's actually gone further with Raman. We can't get around the integration time. So to study fast things, we just have to integrate for so long that it's not really a particle tracking thing. It might be more of a a cell migration type time scale on the minutes kind of time scale, but on this the second particle tracking in a cell type stuff, we haven't we haven't been able to do it.
