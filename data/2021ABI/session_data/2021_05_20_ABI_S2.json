And uh the research program that we are pursuing is uh interested in understanding the signaling networks that govern cell migration and we are using cultured endothelial cells as a model system and we're interested in both the signaling dynamics in individual cells um but also how these signaling dynamics in individual cells are coordinated between neighboring cells during collective cell migration. And uh we have a a two-dimensional model for collective cell migration which is basically just monolayers and cells are moving within the monolayers but also three-dimensional migration and and morphogenesis, which is something endothelial cells do. So a lot of our work relies on fluorescence imaging using um probes, reporters for cytoskeletal structures or for um for fret based fret based probes for activities such as ro GTPases. So we're tracking cells but in in in single cells we're also tracking um regions of cells like protrusions, retractions and trying to relate those morphogenetic processes to signaling activities.",

And then the second area that's kind of germaine to this topic is really the imaging and control of gene and cell therapies.

Um but in terms of um but in terms of answering the question about how can we see cells as they migrate through actual organisms the reason that gets difficult is our pain point is imaging through scattering tissue which is whenever you get into bigger biology that's what we struggle with. Like MRI CT pet they we're a lot more um limited by that than the other modalities are. That said uh there is there are a few hybrid approaches are coming in. And so at least for small organisms like um you know like zebrafish or maybe uh even a mouse brain where you like take off the skull and you put like a transmission window through it. In these types of uh specific scenarios there are systems where uh you kind of get pseudo optical resolution but with a lot greater uh penetration depth into the scattering tissue. Um and so I wonder if there's a way to track cells at least in that first millimeter or so depth into the scattering tissue and that might be really important for specific applications where maybe the cell you care about isn't going to go through the whole organism it's only is going to be localized to like the surface areas of the brain or of the spinal cord or whatever. Um and so some technology that I'm really excited about in this space uh like are like of course you have the normal very uh popular optical technologies like confocal and light sheet and stuff like that.",
