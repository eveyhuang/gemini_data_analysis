So starting with biocompatible and biodegradable semiconductor nanocrystals and then developing their optical properties rather than starting with things first made for solar cells and uh LED lights, maybe make them for a biological approach and then develop the optical things.

And uh we have a a two-dimensional model for collective cell migration which is basically just monolayers and cells are moving within the monolayers but also three-dimensional migration and and morphogenesis, which is something endothelial cells do. So a lot of our work relies on fluorescence imaging using um probes, reporters for cytoskeletal structures or for um for fret based fret based probes for activities such as ro GTPases. So we're tracking cells but in in in single cells we're also tracking um regions of cells like protrusions, retractions and trying to relate those morphogenetic processes to signaling activities.",

I'm a um one day a week clinician as a nuclear radiologist and uh four to five to six day a week, you know, scientist in the lab and uh the fields I work in are predominantly chemical biology and molecular imaging from the combination of the two are sort of interrelated. So we have some um synthetic chemistry efforts in the lab. Um, I'd say the the areas that we're the most focus on right now are imaging of infectious diseases. So one is how do you monitor bacteria trafficking around an animal or a human. So we do pet reporter um pet probe approaches for that. And then the second area that's kind of germaine to this topic is really the imaging and control of gene and cell therapies. And so if you look at, you know, the next breakthrough or pillar of medical therapies, it's probably going to come through these engineered systems where viruses and cells have been made to treat people's diseases and how do we get assessments of those um those therapies in situ.",

Um but in terms of um but in terms of answering the question about how can we see cells as they migrate through actual organisms the reason that gets difficult is our pain point is imaging through scattering tissue which is whenever you get into bigger biology that's what we struggle with. Like MRI CT pet they we're a lot more um limited by that than the other modalities are. That said uh there is there are a few hybrid approaches are coming in. And so at least for small organisms like um you know like zebrafish or maybe uh even a mouse brain where you like take off the skull and you put like a transmission window through it. In these types of uh specific scenarios there are systems where uh you kind of get pseudo optical resolution but with a lot greater uh penetration depth into the scattering tissue. Um and so I wonder if there's a way to track cells at least in that first millimeter or so depth into the scattering tissue and that might be really important for specific applications where maybe the cell you care about isn't going to go through the whole organism it's only is going to be localized to like the surface areas of the brain or of the spinal cord or whatever. Um and so some technology that I'm really excited about in this space uh like are like of course you have the normal very uh popular optical technologies like confocal and light sheet and stuff like that.",

And so I've always wondered sort of why um you know people haven't sort of focused on um you know contrast like instead of contrast injectable contrast dies but contrast lipids or whatever that would be labeling single cells or that would be I don't know we we talked about actually like injecting iron or like soaking the cells in iron and then trying to chase them around in in our CT one time but of course I didn't have the bandwidth to do that.",
