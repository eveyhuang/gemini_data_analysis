Our my lab is developing optical imaging techniques such as SRS and multifoton fluorescence microscopy. So we have been integrating two imaging modalities together to visualize the metabolic activities in living living organisms. So there are two layers of of imaging approach. One is the label free including the fluorescence multifoton fluorescence for example, we look at the NADH or flavor molecules in the living organism. And another layer is the Raman label free approach that we can visualize those lipids and protein information inside the animals and tissues. And we also want to separate the new molecules, uh newly synthesized molecule from the older endogenous molecules. So we have been also label those metabolites such as using heavy water or deterium labeled glucose amino acids to probe the metabolic activities in the live animals. So uh in that case we can separate those new molecules from the older molecules and uh quantitatively image the metabolic turnover rate for each of the macro molecules in the in the body.

Well for example I I I take like five minutes to take the image when you have that piece of tissue and immediately you have the digital H and E maybe H and E and the pathologist can look at the H image in a few minutes and determine if there's tumor still left or not. So it saves a few hours and uh the patient can be wake up very soon um not they they don't need to be under anesthesia for that long. So it's kind of protecting the brain. Also it's it's a biopsy.

And that's such a different thing and yet we say it and and that's sort of a mindset issue. Um, the other thing is out of the prompts that we started with, the idea that metabolic changes proceed physiological changes, I think when we're looking at the brain and and we are using physiological measures of um, well what I would call physiological measures, we're using vascular properties to estimate a metabolic property. So the timeline of things is really important when we try to infer one from the other. So in the pathologies, knowing when we can trust our models of how vascular signals relate to metabolism or when those models have already broken down because metabolism wrecked that something about the vascular thing we're measuring. I'm not sure I'm being very coherent, but I feel like it's it's a big challenge that like with a lot of things with this neuro MRI view of metabolism, I feel like we're we're a bit superficial with it so far.",
