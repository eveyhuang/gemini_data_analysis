I'm not I don't have an answer to this question but it might be a question that electrochemists could answer in 25 years. I know that there's a lot of electrochemical like CO2 reduction to formate or acetate that feeds bacteria but I mean is there some way to maybe make a cybernetic plant that borrows all of that machinery the healing and the CO2 capture that plants have and then we just somehow integrate biosensors or electrodes like we like we do into people's brains to to map their the electrochemical activity in their brains can we actually use that to to actually spur on biomass production rather than like trying to capture CO2 out of a flue gas we could actually jury rig a plant in order to to to couple it to its own benefits and strengths. I think that there's probably some electrochemist I don't know the answer to that but there might be some electrochemist that is smart enough to figure out how to do that.

Or well, even in this case, if you if you pre-absorbed it to something like that, you need something that's going to still be downhill in energy to to, you know, drive it off the amine. And so I I can't think of anything more creative than hydrogen, but it it seems like whether it's whether it's gaseous or it's, you know, protons plus electrons is is like can you when once you form carbamates, will they just reduce off under like if you if you had those at an electrified surface, just by P that kind of reactions?
