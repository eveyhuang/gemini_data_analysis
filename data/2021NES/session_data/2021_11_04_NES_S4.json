And um when I think about the proposed um solutions that we have, for example, we can do carbon storage, that seems to be the one that will get the most immediate climate change benefit. But if we're looking in the long term, what sort of value added products will be helpful um that will sort of coincide or or um um be uh something that we can use in analogy to petrochemical based products. And so that's a question that I always think of because um I think it's really great science that we can develop CO2 and methane and make it into aromatics or all of these different nice molecules, but I don't want us to end up in the same situation that we're in now and and we have another silog of like, okay, now what do we do with these products.

And I think a lot um for me one of the important questions when it comes to design these types of compounds is is from a materials perspective which we spend a lot of time talking about, there's a whole um volume of material that may or may not be participating in in the overall reactivity of the surfaces. And so how do you leverage the surface chemistry to optimize the reactivity, keeping in mind that these defects as Kelsey mentioned or or other types of things happening within the bulk of the solid is also playing a role in the net chemistry. And so from that perspective, how can you then design active sites at the surface of the material on the atomic level that will then enhance your overall reactivity. And so selfishly that brings you to clusters, which are obviously the answer to everything. So um so I think that like for me thinking along those continuum and in selecting the types of of catalysts um that you're interested in studying is really important.",

And I know that we have to propose some design principle but usually I strongly correlated to this what I called structure features or environmental features. So as I mentioned earlier I hope what I model is what exactly is there but but it's still very difficult to know that I keep asking experimentalist do you know do you have exact control and do you think the surface configuration actually change in the react in the reaction procedure but usually I cannot get very good answer. Like I know like we do the like the CO2 reduction on copper but I I feel like the the surface charge of the copper I also say maybe the oxidation number it keep changing. These are the things that actually all leads to the complication that we we we want to think about but it's it's hard.",

So with this question about how to design catalysts to function in dilute streams, we actually try to cheat that a little bit with the development of these dual functional materials, right? And so you have this catalyst material that captures the CO2 out of dilute streams and then the second step is then to react the captured CO2 which is in the form of a carbonate into some um valuable added products. So the way that we've been trying to circumvent that at least with thermal catalysis is developing a material that can capture in dilute streams and then react that after you concentrate that CO2 stream then react it later. Um, but I was also listening to the conversation about carbon carbon carbon carbon coupling electrocatalytically and it's also very difficult um with thermal catalysis as well. And people have been thinking about um oxidative coupling of methane, you know, with CO2, uh where you can make like ethylene. And the biggest issue there, the selectivity is low. There has been decades of research on this field and the needle has been moved only a tiny bit. And so um, you know, it's like where do we address that? How can we improve catalyst materials to actually do carbon carbon coupling of captured CO2 as well. So that's a prominent um question in thermal catalysis.
