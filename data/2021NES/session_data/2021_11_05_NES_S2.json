Um, but if you look at a systems wide perspective, my question is, if we do collect all of the point source or all of the easy low hanging fruit of point source uh CO2, can the environment naturally absorb the the additional CO2 or is the direct air going to be needed regardless of it?

            "transcript": "So I can correct me if I'm wrong here, but my understanding here is that the we do need in addition to point source capture, we will need some air capture because we need to deal with historical emissions. So one way or the other that has to that has to happen. The way I think about point source versus direct air capture in terms of the trade-off is with point source, it's great that the concentrations are really high. That helps you energetically. But you want to capture as close to 100% of the as much of the CO2 coming from a point source as possible. And so the rate of capture has to be matched to the rate at which the CO2 is being produced to some extent. So even though you have a higher concentration, there's still a sort of you're still constrained in the sense that you have to capture you still have to impose a really high rate of capture. That also carries energetic penalties. Whereas with air capture, the concentration is a bit lower, but you might imagine there you're sort of in terms of the amount you need to capture, you know, atmosphere is just sort of 400 ppm, so you sort of have a constant PCO2 source. And you can think about people are thinking about all kinds of designs. You could have something like a sort of a tree-like design that just sort of sits there. It's not very energy intensive in terms of the amount of air, you know, the energy you need to spend in terms of contacting your sorbent with with air. And it could just sort of passively collect CO2. Of course, you want to do it at a really high rate and at a sufficiently high rate that it makes sense from a system level perspective. But you know, even though air capture you're doing it from a low concentration source, there is some flexibility in terms of how much you need to capture over a given period of time. And in terms of durability, my understanding with some of the point source work is amines, for example, which are common for point source capture, do degrade over time because you're dealing with, you know, fairly high temperatures in the from exhaust of fossil plant exhaust and so on. So anyway, that's just a sort of a thought when you sort of Yeah, go ahead.",

One topic that I'll throw out there for you all to think about that I haven't heard anybody discuss in this context is if we imagine deploying direct air capture on a large scale, regardless of what approach we use, whether we use liquids or solids, inorganic structures, organic structures, probably they're going to create some emissions themselves. Maybe they're going to be VOCs, maybe they're going to be particulates. But I to my knowledge, nobody has really considered that as a research topic or a research area. And nobody has looked at how emissions associated with these chemical plants, which effectively is what they are, how that's going to intersect with current atmospheric chemistry from a from a traditional pollution perspective as opposed to a obviously it's it's removing CO2 pollution, but it might be introducing new types of pollution that I don't think anybody has thought about. So I'll just throw that out there as something you all can think about for potential proposal ideas. It has been studied pretty well for point source capture. So amine-based systems and point source capture, they make some pretty nasty off products like nitrosamines. So I don't know if that will extend to DAC systems for example, where the exposure to the environment is many many fold higher.",

So I had the opportunity to visit, you know, the the power plant in Alabama where they have the, you know, NETL has this pilot plant, you know, you can go there and try out your capture technology. I I saw how big those absorption desorption columns were and you have to like you know, I just couldn't comprehend how big this has to be for like even a 500 megawatt power plant. So when you think about the scale of things, I I think, you know, what Chris mentioned, you know, whatever you're bringing in needs to be benign or, you know, needs to have some green aspects to it. Um, so I think when I think about the whole system, so you have to remove, you know, NOx and SOx and and then and then by the time it's it's the CO2, you still have these impurities. So the one question in our queue for our group is, you know, integration, like electrochemical CO2 reduction. So when I think about those things that also needs to be added on on top of, you know, the captured CO2, it just keeps adding up and I don't know the next question that follows is, you know, what are the metrics for contrasting different capture technologies? Um, do we have to take into account all of these other things apart from just our capture technology itself, but all of the other things and at the end of the day, is that really, you know, like meaningful solution or not? Um, that's something that I'm kind of trying to open my eyes to. For the most part, I have been, you know, working with, okay, this material, I need to improve its performance. But you know, electrochemical CO2 reduction has been researched for the last, I don't know, 160 years and it's not it's not at the point where we can still deploy it, right?

Right now at this stage for DAC most of the targets that I've seen from both private and government organizations focused on uh um you know, just demonstrated viability and cost. And obviously durability comes in under cost. Um, and as you said it's going to vary for different technology areas. So one Marta and I work at the same university and one of our colleagues Ryan Lively uh working with Matthew Ralph just recently did a systems level analysis of Bex incorporating for those of you who don't know Bex is bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration. So it also involves carbon capture in the similar way to post combustion or or DAC. And for that system they found that the magic number was about a year of durability and that much less than a year if you got durabilities less than that, you got significant increases in cost, but that the curve turned over between one and two years such that the difference between one year and three years was diminishing returns and there really wasn't a lot to be gained there. So I'll use that as an introduction to point out that if you are, you know, a molecular chemist or if you're somebody who works on materials for um, you know, conversion or capture, it's good to think about trying to also partner with and collaborate with uh systems people who can look at the whole system because it's very difficult to understand the importance of something like lifetime if you're only looking at a small component of an overall process. And I know Silog, Sloan, a lot of the other foundations are very basic science focused and I think that's an important part of what we should be doing here, but I also think that they would encourage collaborations and insights from systems level people who can help to give context to the to the basic science we produce.",

Normally if you imagine developing a process, you're going to run it the same everywhere in the world, whether it's in, you know, Kuwait or Canada or Chile or South Africa, right? It's it's going to be say 200 degrees C, five bars pressure, whatever it is. That's not the case for DAC. It is going to be constant that it's going to be around say 300 to 600 parts per million CO2 so you can design around that, but if you look at the absolute humidity and how it varies say in the desert in the winter compared to, you know, near the equator in the summer, you have orders of magnitude variations in water content. And that's a a major competitor for CO2 absorption on any any material. And so you can imagine that if you're in a cold climate like Alaska, um the the driving force for absorption based on the temperature and humidity is going to be very different from what it is in, you know, Gainesville, Florida as an as an example. And I think that's a further element that not many people have thought about and when we started thinking about just a simple question of after working in the field for 10 years designing materials to operate at room temperature because that's what the lab temperature is. When we asked a simple question, what would we do differently if we were at minus 10 or minus 20 degrees C, it really opened some different ways of thinking about the problem and we were able that potentially find materials and processes under those conditions that might actually have a lower energy penalty. Uh because there's a stronger driving force for absorption, you can use more physisorption so you don't have to pay the high penalty of desorbing a chemisorbent. And so thinking about varied operational conditions I think can maybe unlock some fresh ideas if you haven't thought about that before.",

I think my thought is that there are so many variables when you think about that technology right the temperatures the humidity but also what you are doing with CO2. I think that's why it's so important to make use of CO2 in some ways and we always talk about electrochemical or some other means of reducing CO2 to something else. Something that I haven't really thought a lot about is there's also interest in ammonia synthesis. Could these things be coupled like can we maybe think a little bit outside of the box and not just focus on converting carbon dioxide to like methane or syngas but can we also add nitrogen to it and maybe make some other products.

So in the context of CO2 storage I would think that's something that would involve a government type entity or some public entity who takes responsibility for some level of public safety I would think and that's the reason why it's a little challenging for players to get into it because it's not a clean problem and it's not a problem that has profit attached to it. So it's basically a public good problem right when it comes to CO2 storage. But that is also one way to think about this is in the context of who takes responsibility for it. So right now when we look at all the fossil fuel divestments that are happening across all the universities it seems like people are pointing their fingers to fossil fuel companies and saying you have to take the responsibility for emitting CO2 but really they're just selling the commodity and we're consuming it every time we turn on our lights. So who takes the end responsibility for that I think that's a much more complex question. I think in terms of realizing this in a commercial scale some of the oil and gas companies are already starting to do this right. So for example Statoil has had more than 10 years of experience trying to store CO2 in the subsurface environments so a lot of oil and gas companies they have the reservoir engineering expertise to figure out how and where to put CO2 in the subsurface environments. From their perspective it's a solved problem because they know the geology and where CO2 can be injected safely and reliably. Their challenge I think is much more along the lines of who's going to pay for it because now the price of gas or the price of X hydrocarbon that they're going to sell into the market is going to increase substantially. So the question is really who you ask. Some people will say that geologic carbon storage is a solved problem some people will say that it's an uncharted territory. It's a question of who you're talking to.",

So I'm a systems modeler and we were looking at carbon capture and storage projects globally but what we had data for were the 34 in the US that were projected to happen said they were going to happen but then they didn't happen. And so most of the storage or use of carbon that happens now and has been happening since the 70s is enhanced oil recovery to help produce oil from oil wells. And one of the problems as Greeshma was alluding to is what else can you do with it. So the carbon there has been carbon capture at some point sources the most successful is at coal-fired power plants but still not everyone is doing it and the question is why. If the technology is there why aren't we doing it. And one of the sad cases was the Petra Nova plant in Texas. They had been capturing carbon at the source but just this February they stopped doing it because the price of oil was too low. So they have all the technology in place and it's just sitting there. And one of the things that we found was that you need a credible revenue stream for your CO2. It can't just be sequestering it. You need the company to make some kind of money off of it. So what kind of products can we make with this I think is a really interesting question.",

That's a federal tax code in the US. And then the California low carbon fuel standard now also gives credits for demonstrated capture and sequestration and those credits trade between 100 and 200 a ton. So again if we're going to address it from a climate perspective that has to be the solution where there's a regional or global agreement on cost of carbon and there's the public good the governments that are providing revenue for that. But we're not going to make any value added products and get ourselves out of the climate change problem just because of scale. I'll give you a simple back of the envelope calculation. We know how much polyethylene we make today. If we could magically snap our fingers and make all the polyethylene out of CO2 we would consume 1% of our CO2 emissions. So it's just not",

So the key opportunities are that the DAC it can actually be deployed independently from point source emissions and with continued use of fossil fuels particularly from sources that are very challenging to capture from we will need to have DAC technologies implemented there's no doubt about it. But there are several challenges and really embedded opportunities that were presented and one of them is the fact that the variability of the compositions is quite high and the scale of the problem is significant and what this implies is that we need to have multiple solutions that need to be developed and encouraged from the standpoint of carbon removal and carbon capture. The second point that was raised was really more of a question which was how do we actually normalize durability for different technologies accounting for variability in compositions and we don't quite have an answer for that yet and so that's something that we need to continue putting resources into to work on. The third point was about the need to integrate molecular scale interactions with process scale engineering is particularly if you're looking to develop new materials thinking about realistic environments and where we can successfully deploy an emerging technology is really important in that context. The impact of varied operational conditions can actually unlock fresh ideas and innovation I would say in DAC as well as in industrial decarbonization so I'll need to add the industrial decarbonization piece. And again feel free to interrupt me at any moment to make sure that I'm capturing all of the ideas that we discussed carefully. So the end fate of CO2 impacts where DAC needs to be implemented. We also talked about we talked less about alternative regeneration approaches for direct air capture or CO2 capture I don't know if you want to make that a part of our agenda item I'm happy to leave it out but that was something that I thought would be nice to put in. We also talked about how converting CO2 to products is insufficient from the climate perspective and that CO2 storage is imperative. Then the question becomes it's not just contributions from fossil fuel usage we also need to think about industrial decarbonization and in that context there are products that are being brought to the market that are increasingly defossilized. So for example ammonia cement and construction materials could well be defossilized over the course of the next decade or so and in such an environment what would be the role of DAC and CO2 capture? So those are some of the key points and are there any additional points that you would like me to add edit remove?",
