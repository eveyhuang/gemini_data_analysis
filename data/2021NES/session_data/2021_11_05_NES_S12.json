This is also an electrochemical system, somehow similar designs to what people are discussing. And somehow it seems to be a little bit scalable. But uh at least we can make implementations, right? In different contexts. But I'm just wondering like as these things get scaled up, how is this going to look like and are we going to hit the bottleneck and where are these bottlenecks, right? For example, some people say we need iridium oxide um for an oxygen evolution reaction, but we have absolutely nearly not enough iridium on planet Earth um to to implement.

So those are the uh things I'm interested in and since my background is on mostly um non-aqueous electrolytes, um, you know, when you when you go through non-aqueous electrolytes, things can get messy. So one of the challenges in my research is, you know, what are the tools we can have in order to, you know, study these interfaces which are kind of buried interfaces. So what what tools do we need really need in order to understand the correct mechanism, you know, uh apart from, you know, what the what's happening on the electrode surface in terms of, you know, whether if it's a copper surface, you're characterizing copper, but what could what can we think about in terms of the methods that can probe the liquid, right?

Massive huge lead electrodes incredibly environmentally bad, but it works works great for them. And so the uh, environmental agency in New York called us and said, you know, see if you can replace them with something better. Uh, but uh, but yeah, it it it's it's chemistry that works at huge scales. They have like, you know, tons of uh, persulfates that are that are kind of getting out there. It's you can so if you can find something like that that you can make that goes into other industries, I think Jenny's point is is excellent.",

Maybe at this stage this is too early to say that and we are in a phase where we're kind of like scouting around and trying to figure out like how how we're solving this problem in the first place, right? But I I generally think um yeah, I I really would like to figure out um like where uh where we are where where electrochemistry is is is making an impact and whether there are like a certain set of categories maybe electro catalysis, electrochemical capture.
