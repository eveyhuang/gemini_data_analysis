I guess that you're all quite experienced now at least either based on the single one you did yesterday or based on what you've seen from yesterday and your previous years experience. So let's see here so the topic let me just share to see if I can actually just so we're all on the same page. This is I mean you all have access to the slide deck so you should you know. Can everybody see my my screen? So I mean the topic of this particular one is mechanisms of electrochemical CO2 reduction and of course it should all be put in the larger context of negative emissions science and you know these are some of the questions that Richard also kind of very very briefly flashed and I don't want to spend too much time on these. Again we can come back to these if we don't cover them. What I would instead like to start with is just making sure that we have somebody who's recording and somebody who is willing to you know report out and then I would just suggest that we take a couple of moments to you know each and one of us just think of one or two questions that you think are appropriate to bring up and then we can basically start the discussion. So you should all I think be able to see this if I just have to stop. Um share my screen. This is the lovely part of Zoom right? Okay so in in the shared Google Drive you can see we this is group 2.4 mechanisms of electrochemical CO2. Um I'm Alex. Um I'm from UPenn and um I'm an associate professor there. I've been there for five years. I work on computational materials chemistry and science um and together with me you heard Emily is one of the co-facilitators. Um so please you know introduce yourself uh say a few words and then we'll just pick one or two people to do the recording and the reporting or if you are interested in doing the taking the task on just wave your hand and uh we can put your name down here. So who would like to go? Just to start a brief brief introduction on name uh where you're from and what you do. Do you want me to call out names as as I'm seeing them on the on the screen maybe? Okay Andrea you're you're at the top of my screen.",

On the other hand it was pointed out to me that there is an advantage of having two because you can have the two people confer at the end to make sure that they have extracted what are the main bullet points and if you have a person who's going to be reporting out they're already looking at the notes of the person who's recording all the weeds and then being able to pull out the ideas at a higher level.

One of the things that I've been trying to understand and struggling with that I think we can all benefit from given the urgency and the timeline we need to solve the problem is translating mechanisms in general but here for electrochemical CO2 reduction translating them from a lab scale to where we envision how things will be used at a larger scale. And there's issues with materials durability and functionality and then operational conditions. If we're running either computations or experiments at a really atomic level a lot of the computations are done in vacuum or with little amounts of solvent because it's so computationally intensive to do these things and then we want to be able to translate that to then how does that help us design an electrolyzer that's 100 megawatts or something. And so there's a lot of steps in between and I'm always concerned that a mechanism we find in the lab may not be the same mechanism that will be used for and so kind of closing that loop and there's a value to all of that. We need the basic science to understand the mechanisms but I think we need the input and the boundary conditions that we envision a technology that doesn't exist. We don't have a 100 megawatt electrolyzer to look at durability. We have to learn fast about other fields like fuel cells and electrolyzers water electrolyzers and start to put those boundary conditions and even operational parameters on more fundamental work because the mechanisms will change and I don't think we have the time to figure out a mechanism at one scale take 40 50 years to make that work there. I think we need to close that loop as soon as possible.",

And the chair very provocatively basically opened up and said do we honestly need to know all of the mechanisms at the atomic scale for us to make things to work? Which all of us were a little bit shaken by because that's kind of what we do for a living right. So we of course want to know as you pointed out we really want to know what is happening at the atomic scale but is it actually necessary? So I want to just kind of continue building off of your discussion is it actually necessary of course the chemical industry is out there and a lot of it does not have any or very little understanding of the actual mechanisms.

That is that if the the model or catalytic mechanisms allow us to make predictions, then they're useful and going back to Wilson's sort of question, I I guess if that mechanism that's developed at the bench scale at research for a well studied system in uh very stringent conditions, how well does that apply as you begin to uh make your system more complex or scale up to industrial scales is is is a really fair and good question to ask and I I I guess it it depends on how useful those models are at making predictions.",

However, what you can get from mechanisms is is predictions that then can be tested uh by well characterized experiments and then once you have that done, the thing that's interesting from from, you know, what you learn from understanding the mechanism is what what is the rate limiting step and how can you uh think about optimizing the system further in order to make it more efficient. And so I think that efficient or selective or or or what have you. So there are really good reasons for looking at mechanisms. It certainly is true that a lot of the, you know, processes in um in the chemical industry are Edison and uh and so, you know, we so I think to to Wilson's point though is is really important to and this came up yesterday in a different context too that that I guess in the plenary when we were having the discussion after the plenary, um that it's really important to think about these um the practical constraints um as a way to then dial go back and say, okay, if I put that constraint on my system, um then what does that also tell me about what I want to study?

When you go to an MEA electrolyzer with the GDE, everything is very different. Do some of the things we even care about matter at that scale?

That's a really important point. It was exactly what the solar fuels hub was supposed to do. I don't know if you were around for that. Uh, but you know, didn't happen.

I have seen oxides having a lot of different kind of properties. Are we uh already fixed on okay, this is the material we are going to use and somehow try to fashion or you know, maybe the kinetics are better or the reaction, you know, rates are better or there is opportunity to also look at novel materials that could achieve something similar or maybe at a faster rate or is there something there?

Um a goal of actually understanding the reaction mechanisms would be you have to actually you you have a basis for pursuing some sort of rational materials design. Um but the problem especially with like true materials or heterogeneous catalysts is that you're not dealing with a defined catalyst structure, right? You're dealing with at a practical level millions of independent little structures in the system at an interface that are driving a reaction, will have different binding energies, will have different performances and stuff. So to me that starts to become more of an experimental challenge of how you actually differentiate what's going on within those types of complex interfaces. So something that I would just kind of point out and ask is like if there was a holy grail type experiment that you could perform to understand really and probe and test some of these different reaction mechanisms experimentally, um what would it be? And what would you actually need to do? Do you have to get down to probing individual reactive sites at an interface or what?",

So a combination of thesescopy under operating conditions is is a challenge to be able to do this because you know, you can imagine if you're aqueous system and you're evolving gases, that's going could have interference with with light and transport issues.

I mean right the the ammonia synthesis, the N2 reduction comes to to mind, right?

Uh the first is that I've heard a lot of discussion about uh you know, development of the catalyst. Uh but I think we've also learned that the reaction conditions can be just as important if not more important. And so I would be really interested, you know, to maybe map that space out much more in depth than it has been mapped out. Um you know, all of these sort of high throughput screens of different metal alloys or different ways to excuse me, combine uh materials to make the electro catalyst are useful for sure. Uh but but I think we need um larger screens as well of, you know, ions that are present or of the electrolyte of the solvent of all of the different reaction conditions that go into this. Um so so that's one thing. Um and then to the provocative statement of whether we really need mechanistic information. Um I'm not excited to say this, but I think maybe I would I would hazard a guess and say no, not always. Um because as you pointed out in in the chemical industry a lot of times I think those conditions had been uh determined just based on a large number of experimental uh attempts, right? And then people found what worked the best. So maybe that's what we need in this case as well just as Charles mentioned determine a system that will uh be potentially practically useful and then try a lot of these high throughput screens uh there and whether or not we completely understand everything uh on a mechanistic level may not matter uh given the time scale we need to make these changes.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, but I think, you know, one thing that can that we can apply on everything, especially computationally kind of is the comment. Like you've all a lot of you have commented on the high throughput studies, right? They can only take us that far, but then to actually include all of that complexity that we're talking about is truly needed. That is where the actual development on the computational side is needed. So we are still lacking a lot of the computational tools for those for us to study those processes. So there's like a big big opportunity within those spaces as well. I mean, we've talked about the development of experimental tools, but it's just as equally important, I think to develop some of the computational tools, especially if they're fast enough to study some of these some of these processes that we're talking about. But it the question in the end that I find the most well, among the more interesting one is, what is the level of complexity that a computational system or a model system needs to have for me to be able to represent in quotation mark real real system. And I don't know the answer because as you as you pointed out, Eva, it's it's a question of how do all of those local effects, those local environments, the operating conditions, how are they actually changing at given system? And we don't know the answer to that. So it kind of to have that computational prediction, we need to have some kind of a benchmark with at least one system experimentally. So having that first step, I think is I mean there are groups that are working on this, of course. So I I'm I think that there'll be a lot of really interesting things coming out, but how can we do this faster is the other thing that is of course the the clock is ticking. Um but it just coming back to the short-lived intermediates was one one thing that I wanted to mention. I mean, there are there are tools. I mean, the a lot of the national labs are having x-ray capabilities and some of them are developing tools to probe some of these short-lived species in aqueous environments actually. So I think that is something that is really, really cool if we can really uh truly get get to that at some point. Um um any other thoughts? What else have did you jot down that we might not have covered so far or any comments on what anybody else has said so far? Wilson, I think Ashleigh, go ahead.",

So as you there are many examples of this and you brought up the the corn ethanol um example as well. And and so I agree. I think as scientists and engineers are moving ahead in these in these directions, it's really important to think about the life cycle analysis and understand the abundance. Now, from a, you know, there's a lot of people on this call that are have chemistry backgrounds and so what we what uh chemists tend to think about is abundance of the of the of the element and and pat ourselves on the back that we're not using iridium, okay?

You know and this isn't known in the in the in the electrochemical and engineering field and the idea we started developing is that we could potentially also induce polymer breakdown with some really clever chemical tuning of the reaction environment. So if you had a soup of many different things that you could recover you could tentatively be doing multiple different kinds of processes if you applied the right potential if you had the right pH.

Um, so you know, one of the pervasive themes that we had through our discussion was in terms of mechanisms of electrochemical CO2 reduction, do we even need to know the mechanism? And and this discussion was came out of um, how the chemical process industry has developed prior to this with a lot of Edison type experiments where they build things and maybe do a kind of um, high throughput or some kind of screening at a relevant industrial scale to find operational conditions or not. And so it's an open question of do we first need to understand mechanisms at an atomic lab scale. Um, and then if those do translate, um, we need to make that translation clear because both computationally and experimentally, um, looking at mechanisms are typically done on well defined surfaces or well defined systems with, you know, probably not a lot of flow or or or um mass transport. But if we look at what this technology would potentially need to be at a high TRL, um, probably the conditions would be very, very different and the mechanisms would probably change. And this has implications for both the materials, so materials durability, um, and selectivity requirements changing as a function of operation conditions, um, degradation modes will probably be different, you know, flooding happens at at larger scales and salt formations which may not need to be dealt with at the lab scale. So, um, it's the kind of the two prong question of do we need to wait or even to say, do we even have the time to wait and look at this from the atomic scale up and take every step there, or can we learn from some of the previous chemical process industry to see um, we need kind of the large scale testing and assessment there to feed the relevant conditions into the the fundamental science. So we recognize the need for both the applied and fundamental work, but I think one of the key messages is that we need that feedback loop to be much quicker and more direct and lean on what's been done with with other even electrochemical technologies. Um, you know, part of that was, you know, defining a lot of our questions here aren't even specific to CO2, they're in general for electrochemical reactions and um, you know, then figuring out if we need to translate something, what we can probe and what we need to probe. So there's a lot of um, spectroscopic and spectro electrochemical technique techniques that give kind of an averaging or an ensemble effect over a heterogeneous surface, um, and that we lose information about single sites and single atoms and how they react. And I think both of those can be useful in in determining uh what how we need to develop large scale um electrolyzer.",

So as part of the first year of the silo we have developed a gas tight rotating cylinder electrode cell where we put the model uh copper polyline copper electrode and we rotate it at different uh rates and as you rotate it even though you have the same potential you actually start to see dramatic changes in in selectivity. We already uh also we have the preprint in in our website. So what we see is that actually mass transport controls selectivity and the the the problem is a little bit more complex. So you actually have a lot of uh CO that is the main reaction intermediate that dissolves and hangs around near the surface of the electrode long enough. So they near the surface of the electrode it actually behaves as a sort of CSTR a continuous stirred tank reactor and then uh what happens is that we get a lot of high uh conversion of CO and uh theory is trying to do a lot of mechanistic understanding of of those systems actually on under high uh conversion of CO and uh typically you don't.",

It makes a lot of sense and then what you have in gas diffusion electrodes is essentially a system where the residence time of carbon monoxide is very long. So once you have a system that has very long residence time for carbon monoxide, then you start to look at it more sort of as a plug flow reactor. So long story short, I think the challenge was to get an electrochemical cell that allows you to control mass transport and at the same time allows you to do product quantification and detection. Um, so I think we have accomplished that through and I think that that that should open the the door to scale up these systems.",

I'd like I'm very grateful for David's support and for our facilitators Chris and Ellen as well as our excellent participants. So there were several aspects that came up uh over the course of our discussion uh particularly in the context of the need for DAC. Um, so one of the nice things about direct air capture is that it can be deployed independently of point source emissions and as we continue as we continue to use fossil fuels, there is going to be an increased need for DAC particularly from sectors that are challenging to decarbonize such as transportation. You're going to need DAC to clean up emissions from uh such sectors. Uh one of the interesting things that came up over the course of our discussion was the fact that there is considerable geographical variability in resources and how that might actually impact the deployment of CO2 capture and DAC technologies. So for example, if you're in regions of the world where uh moisture contents are different or in certain locations where the compositions of air are even different, separation technologies will need to be tailored for such regions. Uh this is a challenge but it's also an opportunity because it locks it it helps us unlock many fresh ideas and innovations in the context of DAC. Uh and perhaps you can take some of that understanding and translate that for CO2 capture as well from diverse set of um emissions. So with that said, our team uh sees the challenge of variability of compositions as something that can actually unlock more innovation. So we think it's actually a positive in the context of um innovating in this space. We also think that understanding durability, economic costs and incentive structures are crucial under real world operating conditions. And this actually goes back to the point that uh Carlos had made about uh the need for molecular scale science as well as the process scale engineering to come together to inform economic costs and incentive structure incentive structures. So there so really there is a need for cross scale thinking in this particular line of work. Uh this line this approach may be unconventional for some of the other research areas but in this area it is crucially needed. Uh another important consideration uh which is unique to DAC is that we need to consider the end fate of CO2 and that would really dictate where we would actually put or implement DACs that CO2 going to be stored underground, is it going to be coupled to utilization, is it going to be coupled to mineralization, in which case the kind of DAC technology that would get deployed might need to get customized. And also this part of the question of uh CO2 conversion to products and our team took the view that CO2 conversion to products is insufficient from the perspective of climate. We wrapped up our discussion from a rather big picture perspective of where DAC and CO2 capture are headed. And so when we look at industrial decarbonization, we're starting to see that there is defossilization of crucial commodities like ammonia, even cement and construction materials. This is something that's going to get realized over the course of the next 10 to 20 years or so. So in this context of defossilization, what is going to be the emerging role of DAC and CO2 capture? It's an open ended question but that is where we choose to wrap up our discussion. So thank you for the opportunity to present.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, so I'm Katie Knowles, I'll be sort of reporting out what we did based on the sort of detailed notes that Ellen took uh during our discussion. And so um, so we're talking about uh materials for separation and storage and uh we talked a lot about the challenges for materials discovery and development. And I think some of these um are continuing on some themes that were discussed in other groups. So gaps between computational predictions and experiments, the fact that like if um you know if a computational study identifies a new material that might be um advantageous for uh separation or storage application, it takes time to actually synthesize that material or it might not be possible to synthesize that material. So um taking feasibility into account when doing these um these uh sort of computational uh predictions. Um we also I uh identified the the need for training sets for machine learning approaches. So um uh sufficient characterization data under the dynamic operating conditions of a lot of these um sorbents uh work under um is needed uh for for this. Um, we also talked about some of the challenges with scale up. So so lab scale experiments and synthesis versus application scale. Um, so things that you consider to be in operando on the lab scale might not truly represent your application scale um conditions. I think this was touched on in some other groups. Um, so degradation processes and reversibility or cyclability issues for the um the sorbents that you know absorb and then we want to release the CO2 at like the storage or conversion um area. A lot of these sorbents function at non-equilibrium conditions, so might eventually break down. Um, some of these degradation products might be sort of the active materials in the storage or catalysis that you're doing. Um, and then I think this point kind of goes back into the modeling where we need to understand what the uncertainties are in the model uh uh predictions in order to um you know apply them in a useful way. Also interfaces are key in these uh sort of material applications but hard to understand. So interfaces is where most of the action happens, but it's it's all these complex processes occur. The interfacial structure is dynamic and different than bulk structure and therefore hard to characterize. Um, we also talked about some underexplored sort of physical phenomena related to um CO2 separation and storage. Um, in this uh sort of the area of sorbents, we talked about light or using light or electrochemistry or humidity swings to trigger desorption might be sort of new um axes to think about um in this context. Um, for storage, we talked about CO2 mineralization and some physical phenomena that needed to kind of understand or accelerate that process um or better understandings of precipitation and dissolution phenomena both sort of solid liquid, so at the solid liquid um interface when you're um sort of forming these sort of solid minerals and at the liquid gas interface when you're actually dissolving CO2 into your liquid um sorbent. We also talked about um some interesting ideas about mining coupling mineralization with mining of valuable elements. And then finally we talked about some design criteria to keep in mind when when thinking about these things. So thermal conductivity, especially if um, you know, the heats of adsorption and desorption are playing a role in the sorbents, electrical conductivity for the electrochemical materials, transparency, if we're talking about using uh light as a trigger, um materials that can accommodate self-healing or assisted healing processes. Um, and then just taking a lot of knowledge from the catalysis community um that they've developed about um adsorption and desorption and sort of balancing the energetics of those two processes and to inform the design of materials for um I think thinking about sorbents again in this case. So I think that sums up a lot of what we talked about.",

Um, I go by Leslie, which is my middle name and I'm a assistant professor at UC Riverside and I'm thankful for the conversations that we had um with our participants and the facilitator, Jordi and George. Um, so we talked about methane capture and valorization and one of the initial um starts of the conversation was what are the potential emitters or emissions. Um, and so we're thinking agricultural sites, um, fossil fuels of course is a major emitter. Um, but then also we have methane in the atmosphere. And so is it really conducive to uh try to capture um if we're going for negative emissions methane out of the atmosphere and you know, how would that work? Would we work from point sources or do we work from dilute sources. And um, it seems like we had agreement that maybe point sources would be the best option. However, um, even if we try to um develop some sort of technology that can take methane from these point sources, they're actually pretty dilute in terms of they have a lot of variability, um, where you can have a few PPMs of methane to hundreds of PPM, um, for example at agricultural sources. And then there's other mediations um for removing methane, um, uh for example from cows and and that's changing their diets and and um other technological innovations like having the mask or something. Um, but if we talk about uh developing technological solutions that we can eventually implement here with the um people that are within this group, um, we talked about a lot of different things and I say that you can probably divide it into three. So it's leaving the chemistry of methane alone, the molecule, which is naturally nonpolar and then doing something with that, maybe changing the pressure or temperature to try to store it. Um, the second is trying to make it more reactive. And so we talked about the idea of reactive capture. And then the last thing um is actually taking inspiration from nature, so using microbes. And so um, the I'll go along this list of possible solutions. One of the first ones was why don't we just oxidize methane all the way to CO2. Um, and even though it sounds like it might be counterintuitive, it still will get the ball rolling because we have existing technology for um direct air capture that we can possibly utilize in combination with some sort of oxidation of methane scheme.",
