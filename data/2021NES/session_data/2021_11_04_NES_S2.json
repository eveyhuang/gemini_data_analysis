I think there's still a lot of work to be done in terms of how you can design your electrode system and how you can really not just precipitate out a big chunk of calcium magnesium, whatever else carbonate you can produce, but there's some fundamental science to be done there if you want to selectively precipitate out calcium carbonate and selectively precipitate out magnesium or anything else. So I think that's one area. The other area is how can you design your electrode system so you can scrape stuff off. The third question is how can you efficiently scrape stuff off. I think there's some design engineering that needs to happen there. And then once you figure all of that together, all of those parameters would then go into designing your contacting system like you were talking about. So I I would think that the TRL for the full component needs to it's it's not quite there yet, right? I don't think I don't think it's more than five.",

So flow batteries are are an area I'm involved in where you you have a you have an architecture that basically allows you to change electrochemically change the chemical the composition of some electrolyte by flowing it through some porous electrode. So if you were to go the other way and do say CO2 release um instead of precipitation, then in principle you could take some bulk electrolyte, bulk amount of seawater and if you're able to just continuously supply protons to the solution then in principle you could you know, with a small fairly small footprint in terms of your electrochemical cell, you could release a bunch of CO2 from seawater that way. Um as long as you're transport, you know, you're not transport limited in terms of your the protonation reaction etc. So so that's one um one strategy.",

So uh by releasing calcium magnesium into water, it uh automatically sucks CO2 into the water to equilibrate with that. So uh uh it forms a soluble bicarbonates and then eventually you can precipitate also the solid carbonates. Uh so we can do that either on land. if we do it on land that accumulates in soil, eventually accumulates in subsoil, eventually in aquifer. But if we do it uh in the ocean or on the beach, then it just sort of uh goes directly into the ocean. which is again sort of how nature does it, right? So so nature every day there's there's rocks dissolving into the rivers and so on. We're just trying to accelerate that by picking the more reactive rocks. the problem is that nature does it too slowly because all the rocks which are currently exposed to rain and and waves, they've already been weathered for millions of years. Uh but if we take those rocks which are more reactive and then we expose them, now don't now they they weather faster.",

But generally it's one of those things where it's it's pretty much established that you're probably not going you can you can always anti-foul and anti-scale for a bit of time but it never indefinitely. Um and so you developing um those surfaces are important but then also developing maybe active ways to regenerate surfaces is also important. I think it's a little easier in a like a electro catalytic system with controlled environments. Whenever you mess with seawater um it's just it's it's it makes it a little bit harder.
