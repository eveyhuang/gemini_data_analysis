And if you actually ask experimentalists very likely they have very little understanding of what is the mass transport inside of those sort of systems and how that couples to kinetics. And then so you're essentially left trying to justify some experimental observations when the experimental observations are really deviated from or affected simply by the geometry of the reactor. So that's where this multi-scale modeling right? I'm interested in this multi-scale modeling. I would like to to see theory that is I read papers and sometimes they they have a big component of theory but I do not really learn a lot because it's matches the results and say yes this will explain them right? And I think every time that I see thermodynamics I'm okay with with the calculations when I see the use of DFT to do kinetics that's when I start to see a lot of red flags because many times I think we don't even understand the reactors that we're using.

So at each point we just need to ask ourselves are we comparing the same things right? And what what is needed in a model or in an experiment what is in the experiment that the model needs to actually take into account right? And that's not always clear and we're always oversimplifying right.

If I'm modeling at a surface level and I have detailed information there, but the data that I'm getting from the experimentalist is a much larger scale, there's a big jump usually to take that we somehow in the modeling field have to and often I do think people look at you and say, okay, you know I work with batteries a lot. Okay, here's my IV curve, match it. But it's like there's a lot of steps that go between what I'm actually modeling and to produce something like that and I'd have to add all these other assumptions in.

Of course, I mean, and you might have seen, I'm sure some of the efforts where people take the other route, especially where people are, you know, modeling or like they're capturing or trying to capture even using ML these days of what is actually happening in an experiment, right? So you don't even need to explicitly have to know what the actual physics or chemistry is. You're really trying to identify relevant patterns, say over time, how is the system changing? We talked about the IV curves here just a seconds ago. There are there are examples for example papers in the battery community where people, you know, really measure what is happening with the IV curve, you scan it over X number of times, and you can make actually quite decent predictions of what will happen even though that you actually don't have a priori knowledge at the smallest scale, right? So you can in theory, you could bridge scales and get information going both up and down, which I think is very important, right? So that also brings a very important question up which is basically what is it at the smallest scale that we actually need to know and what from that scale is necessary for us to bring over up in the different length scales for us to capture the overall physics or chemistry, which is something that I think like philosophically is something that is quite rarely discussed in the communities, right? We talk about and we've talked about since the, you know, before most of us entered these fields, right? We're talking about 60s, 70s and in the 80s when people started talking about multi-scale modeling. But very few breakthroughs have actually been done and it typically it's between one or two like it it's bridging the one or two scales at the time. Going all the way, really knowing what to extract from the smallest and then penetrate that all the way up is still something that has only been done in a couple of different cases. So I just wanted to to bring that up. What do you think is the necessary information that needs to be, you know, brought across the scales to actually make a prediction or vice versa, could we use for example ML to go the other way around to even potentially get some physical or chemical intuition of what that should be?",

The idea of the dimensionless analysis is that because there is no dimension, it should be correct at any scale. And if you're trying to scale up a process or to understand what is happening, for example a dimensionless number can tell you what is the relative reaction rate versus diffusion rate or mass transport rate versus convection without telling you what is exactly the rate. So that we have found that in in electrochemical cells, you can actually do that and you can remove a lot of the complexities. And in one of the cells that we have, what we do is that we put different molecules and we use them on the same electrode that is rotating in the same cell and we look at what is the mass transport limited current to transform those molecules. And what we can extract is that each molecule behaves in a different way but all of them are riding sort of the same hydrodynamics in the cell. So some of them will travel much faster through through those waves because they have a higher diffusion coefficient. But once you actually account for that, you can actually describe the the reactor or the hydrodynamics in the cell but it applies exactly for all of them. And then so dimensionless numbers tell us what is relevant. Is it convection? Is it diffusion near the surface of the electrode? What we have found at least in on CO2 electrochemistry is that you make take carbon dioxide, you make carbon monoxide, and you would think that that carbon monoxide is staying on the surface but in reality it desorbs very quickly but it just it cannot go away. So it lingers around. And then in that process of lingering around is where you have re-adsorption and most likely reaction where you the carbon monoxide is landing from the top and not really a CC coupling is not really happening on the on the surface. But the question is also can you what are",

The convection is not perhaps as significant but in electrochemistry, aqueous electrochemistry that's the case. And then so we have used the same cell for nitrate reduction, methane reduction, uh uh CO2 electrochemistry, CO electrochemistry and all of them behave exactly on the same way in a dimensionless scale when you account for the diffusion coefficients, the the difference for example in the solubility of the different molecules in the bulk of the electrolyte. Uh so I think so that's sort of the strength of uh of dimensionless analysis that it is really doesn't care what is the molecule that you're putting in.

But yes absolutely I think actually it is completely I wouldn't say completely but it is quite unknown what exactly the role of a coupled proton electron step versus a decoupled one is in these electrochemical systems in general. There are a few systems where it has been studied. There's some in the molecular catalysis or community there's a lot of work but for surfaces this is actually very a very very challenging it's a long-standing challenging problem how do you include charge and how do you model that and there are some efforts of course but I think those are still big big big challenges that that still remain which is good we have a lot of of work ahead of us.",

I feel like that's although I don't think it's easy I think there's so many challenges to it like that's what what I feel like experimentalists often want to see to know that back to what we were saying before we're only modeling what we can but that we're modeling reality or as close as we can to a reality.",

And so where do you find that sort of intermediate of addressing things like you're pointing out, the environment, pH, heterogeneous architectures, the presence of defect sites. And it's not clear to me that we're there at an experimental level or a theory level as a community, but that's something we're striving for and you know, Carlos brings up the point of how fast will we move towards something like that versus be critical and hesitant to make those leaps and extensions and our ability to model and our ability to measure.

One of the simplest, so when we are trying to model something, for example, a defect interaction with a diffusing species, it's still a challenge to capture what really happens in experiment when we do this in the continuum level, we are again simplifying it, right? So for example, you have a range of defects with complex topologies with multiple physics that interplay in that locality. And at the end of the day, we're trying to model the very simplest idealized version of this defect and then trying to understand how this affects certain fundamental, if it's the diffusion kinetics we're thinking of, how does that change in the presence of a defect? But I think although it's kind of simple, I still do think introducing a small seed of that heterogeneity gives us a lot of knowledge and understanding what perhaps happens in a complex system, but it is a challenge to implement that in a computational framework.

It's actually a perfect analogy in that if you now today ask anyone working in fusion, and I think there's a number of entrepreneurs working in fusion, they will definitely disagree with you strongly that it's 20 years away and Commonwealth Fusion has sort of demonstrated a lot of cool things. I think in the same sense, I think we're at a cusp for like multi-scale modeling to completely sort of make a big breakthrough. And the key innovation I think is differentiable programming. What has become possible now is you can basically differentiate through full codes. So which means that Emily can build a phase field model, I could differentiate through her code, and then Ananya can build something in the meso scale, I can differentiate through that, and then I can differentiate then through molecular dynamics. So there is a natural way in which now we can do scale bridging. And there's a sort of longer article that I wrote, I'll post to the chat, but I think that's the key enabler which now before we had to we all had to sort of infer output measurement to like, okay, what is happening at the molecular scale or the meso scale or things like that. I think this is the big game changer. And I think with this, we're at the sort of very, very beginning of being able to pull all this off, but there's now reliable differentiable frameworks in various spaces. There's JAX-MD which can do differentiable molecular dynamics, there's JAX-CFD which can do differentiable CFD. There's now startings of a differentiable DFT with Mohammed Qasim's work. So if you can chain all of these things together, basically it's a slam dunk in terms of how you take how you can connect the scales and how you can bridge the scales. I mean, we have decades of work left for any of these things to like sort of fully get production scale. But I think that is the key enabler. I think that I'm very, very optimistic.
