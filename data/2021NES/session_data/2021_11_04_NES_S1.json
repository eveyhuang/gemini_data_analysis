So thinking about photocatalysis like sure you're generating a photo electron that has enough reducing potential to get you to that first step reduce CO2 but is it going to actually make it there before it disappears right. And so thinking about and and sometimes that's not always clear a priori right and so this is where coming um failed experiments are useful being like well on paper this material seems like it's a great you know could you know has the right thermodynamics but then when we go to do the experiment we don't get the photocurrents that you would expect because we have these others and unanticipated processes and and how can we start to anticipate those um more ahead of time or um start to try to understand um how to control those as well.",

            "transcript": "So so let me let me say this so uh I I think so we found as as the main challenge is that we didn't even understand the electrochemical cells that we use. All right so uh when you do modeling right or if you're trying to study kinetics right you try to uh study kinetics under low conversion conditions. All right and then so you try to write an equation rate of K uh multiplied by the concentration of something right but that uh will give you a different reaction rate if it's in a CSTR reactor or a PFR and so a lot of the the mass transport actually plays a lot of effects and I think a challenge with theory is that you try to fit the the experiments with the assumption that the experiments are correct but actually they are not. So uh what we have developed is an electrochemical cell that allows you to take that copper flat polycrystalline copper and rotate it at different uh rotation speeds and then we do gas product detection and and and liquid product uh quantification. So because we can understand the mass transport and how it changes selectivity because it changes a lot the selectivity but what we realize is that uh the main reaction intermediate is CO and then you would not like to study the the the kinetics of CO conversion at under 95% conversion but that's actually what is happening. Most of the CO that you make at the surface it actually desorbs and actually it lingers around the electrode because it cannot be in the reaction zone it does not travel uh away fast enough so it actually behaves sort of as a CSTR and then when you start looking at production rates of uh ethylene or ethanol or all these those are actually affected by the residence time of carbon monoxide near the surface of the electrode. So through the running of the copper like at different rotations different temperatures different uh bicarbonate concentrations we have started to break down uh those paths right and it it it's mind-boggling that all these things were already explained in the 70s. All the equations all these rotating cylinder electrodes I mean this is the most frustrating thing I didn't I mean we're just not we don't know good electrochemistry. It's uh but all these things were developed already by by people in the 70s and then the mechanism is is very uh nice. So you have the rate-limiting step is CO2 to CO and then that CO is just is inside of a CSTR reactor and how you change all these cation effects go go away once you uh start to to to to understand what what is happening is not a double layer effect but it's just a residence time and uh",

But moving away from that and assuming that it's great, you know, the problem that I see is that it's becoming saturated, CO2 reduction is being saturated with groups that publish and say, I have a new catalyst, it's the best ever, here it is. And benchmarking gets away from some of that, but what we saw when we did HER and OER benchmarking is everyone just tweaked their system to meet the new benchmarks and they basically, I mean, we got lots of high surface area nickel foam supported OER catalysts that of course have high activity per geometric area, but then it took a back seat to, I mean, sort of the mechanistic studies took a back seat to that because if you didn't meet certain performance metrics, you couldn't get published. And so there would be no way for you to think about, well this catalyst didn't work as well, here's why it didn't work as well, going back to some of the failure modes. That sort of fell away and I think it really hurt the OER community for several years because there were just so many papers about, well we have the best catalyst, look, it's 200 millivolt overpotential, it's 150 millivolt overpotential based on basically fake metrics because they gamed the system.",

And I think it probably did this field more harm. And looking back a decade, one of the and I was a Scialog fellow at the photocatalysis one, I think one of the things that they did really well is re-emphasize new mechanisms, like the search for and looking for new science that could power this. And if if that's what we could achieve here today, I think that would be incredibly powerful is is looking at what strands of mechanisms exist and how they could be brought together and then diverge again to get you to whatever product you want to get to.

If you if you come up with like if you focus too much on like electro-catalysis and you find like you know copper being the you know that's going to be our champion electrochemical electrocatalyst, is that enough to like then crank out copper, you know, are we running into a problem like there's not enough copper to do this on the scale that we want to do it on, right?

And so so this was all based on an electrochemical conversion experiment that gave us this feedback. And now we're, you know, sort of like purposefully thinking about what other environments we could expose the surface. So we could think about it from that angle and then and then obviously the angle of what other changes we can make to the actual environment of the surface so we could help with some of these reaction trajectories. So the answer is yes, it could happen in both worlds, but but I think both worlds could talk to each other and and and and develop design principles.",

And the way we kind of started thinking about this is because we noticed our our electrolysis is heating up. We have these very resistive cells and we've started thinking about localized heating at the points of maximal resistance. And we actually have some evidence that in a canonical molecular electrocatalyst that makes carbon monoxide and water with just a proton source in acetonitrile that the product actually forms at the frit and not the electrode surface which raises the question of transport. Normally we have this paradigm where you know the product's formed at the electrode and you know that's where we study everything but I think there's like a huge landscape of product distributions that we're just missing out that nobody's really seen.

I mean carbon as a resource if you can build it into a chain you can do anything with it so I guess I think having an end game would help us answer some of these questions as opposed to just focusing on CO production.",

So if you're building a CO2 electrolyzer we can do that and make CO at relatively high efficiencies people have demonstrated that at least on small scale and then so is this really that we need to so you know again I'm funded in CO2 reduction I'm not trying to put down electrochemical CO2 reduction at all and I hope I continue to get funded on mechanistic studies but is this more of an engineering issue if we're thinking about because we know how to we also know thermal catalysis we can hydrogenate CO very well in industry with H2 wherever that H2 comes from we can hydrogenate CO.",
