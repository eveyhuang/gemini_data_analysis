We're also interested in understanding the kinetics of some of the microstructural evolution and how this affects how a material responds to an external stimuli. And in the context of this conference, we are interested to sort of develop continuum scale models to understand the fundamentals of absorption process, competing diffusion mechanisms, and how this affects material properties that are used for absorption and storage.",

And then it turns out that I think people that do theory trust that people that do experiments do the experiments in a controlled manner and that we have a good understanding of the types of reactors that we use. And if you actually ask experimentally, very likely they have very little understanding of what is the mass transport inside of those sort of systems and how that couples to kinetics. And then so you're essentially left trying to justify some experimental observations when the experimental observations and are really deviated from from it's affected simply by the geometry of the reactor. So that's where this I'm interested in this multiscale modeling, right? I would like to to see theory that is I read papers and sometimes they they have a big component of theory, but I do not really learn a lot because it matches the results and you say yes, this will explain them, right? And I think every time that I see thermodynamics, I'm okay with the calculations. When I see the use of DFT to do kinetics, that's when I start to see a lot of red flags because many times I think we don't even understand the reactors are where used.

So at each point, we just need to ask ourselves, are we comparing the same things, right? And what what is needed in a model or in an experiment? What is in the experiment that the model needs to actually take into account, right? And that's not always clear, and we always oversimplify, right?

But look, like you're saying, intuitively, or just, you know, known known quantities that increases when we expect it to increase. That's not always kind of good enough when when you talk to the community, I find. So I agree with you, but it runs up against the limit. And the one thing I kind of hear was talking about here is, you know, basically the idea of VVUCQ, right? Verification, validation, and certain quantification. And we started out with this conversation of propagating it. Um, I feel like that's although I don't think it's easy. I think there's so many challenges to it. Like that's what what I've experimentalists often want to see to know that back to what we were saying before, we're only modeling what we can, but we're modeling reality, or as close as we can to reality.",

Do you mean environment, I mean climate? I mean environment larger systems. The actual systems. Yes, I should specify. I mean, if we're looking at the electrochemical cell, like Carlos was talking about, right? The environment of that material is actually an explicit solvent somehow with ions and stuff like that. That's what I mean by the micro environment of of the at that interface where the actual chemistry is taking place, right?

And so where do you find that sort of, uh, intermediate of of addressing things like you're pointing out, the environment, uh, pH, heterogeneous architectures, the presence of defect sites.

So, for example, you have a range of defects with complex topologies with couple multiple, you know, multiple physics that interplay in that local in that locality. And at the end of the day, we're trying to model the very simplest idealized version of this defect and then trying to understand how this affects certain fundamental if it's the diffusion kinetics we're thinking of, how does that change in the presence of a defect? But I think although it's kind of simple, I still do think, uh, introducing a small seed of that heterogeneity gives us a lot of knowledge and understanding what perhaps happens in a complex system, but it's uh, but it it is challenging it is it is a challenge to implement that in a computational framework.
