            "transcript": "So a comment coming back to what's been discussed a lot is Jimmy and Venkat you're discussing kind of techno economic type of things and costs of catalyst and Venkat you brought up Opus 12 and Dioxide. So we work with both of those companies and NREL we've done pretty extensive techno economic and life cycle assessment of various CO2 processes. And what we see is when you get to scale, the cost of the catalyst is nothing. We assume that every catalyst will be bulk copper. So it absolutely is not the catalyst cost and for PEM electrolysis where you have platinum and iridium based catalyst, that's a huge driver. But for CO2 reduction, it's not. And so what we find is regardless if we do the Opus 12 approach is using PEM electrolysis essentially with CO2 catalyst. So it's an acidic environment and Dioxide is alkaline electrolysis with CO2. And in both cases when we get to the economy of scales, whether it's acidic or basic, the major cost driver and the major cost at these systems is the cost of the membranes. And so I think as we for this room of a complete picture of CO2 reduction, I think membranes is a huge thing, especially alkaline exchange membranes in terms of separations, stability, managing pHs. But we even find in the manufacturing that at large scales when we get to over 10,000 units made of any of these systems, including things like bipolar plates, recirculation. So the first thing is that membranes is something I think that is huge and important for this field. The other thing is that Venkat you're mentioning that the price of electricity and how we kind of distill that into metrics in the lab that are the most relevant that are correlated to that. The two metrics we see that are the biggest knobs to turn are the single pass conversion efficiency and the current density. So current density and it's a challenge, I think, a big challenge for the field and that those two metrics seem to be counterproductive to each other. If you increase the current density, usually you decrease the single pass conversion and vice versa, if you have low flow rates to have a higher conversion efficiency, you're going to have lower currents. So we see that the biggest economic knobs to turn are the membrane costs and the biggest performance metrics are current density and single pass.",

I think that might be might be a good good one to sort of define very clearly. And in my mind, I'll give a first first pass which hopefully you will all agree, disagree with is, essentially, what are the what are the control variables, right? You have a particular catalyst, you have particular reaction conditions. So concentration of CO2, medium, electrolytes, etc. And then a range of different driving forces such as voltage. And then other sort of photon or or if you're thinking photocatalytic, then photon driven and maybe P photoelectro catalytic. So maybe those are combined. And so what we want to be able to say is, given control variables as well as driving forces, what will be the product distribution when product distribution of this reaction? That's sort of the highest order. And the second granularity would be that if you could understand exactly how that product was reached or or what were the what were the intermediate steps. So I think first might be a reasonable achievement even if that's done. The second would be obviously from a science perspective, second would be the more important achievement.",

So I think for me because there's two other sections that are looking at mechanistic CO2 reduction, we should look at a bit bigger picture. And I think one of the things we should consider is maybe CO2 reduction directly won't make every product that we want it to. Maybe we're not going to be able to make methanol, ethanol, propanol. And so, understanding selectivity, I think, is still something that's very interesting and fundamental, but you know, I think to focus that could be the selectivity of CO2 reduction versus hydrogen evolution as one major bifurcation. And then, you know, what CO2 reduces to. I mean, my personal opinion is that at an industrial scale, electrochemical CO2 reduction at best will get us CO and formic acid, but I don't think at an industrial scale we're going to make any other product, and that's fine because I think the role that electrochemistry and electrochemical CO2 reduction can be making really stable robust precursors that can be converted by more, you know, advanced processes. So to me, you know, I think the discussion should be less about selectivity to kind of C2, C3, C4 products, but more this kind of intrinsic. One thing I think we all would agree, however we do this, water will be involved there somewhere and shutting off hydrogen evolution versus CO2 reduction as a main bottleneck. I think that could be something that is interesting for everyone.",

So could we open up uh new materials that we would have not been able to do? And and there are two things that happen with single atom. One, it it attacks two things at once, which I think makes it an very exciting material set. It it first attacks the cost question like you pointed out, um actually. And then the second thing it actually attacks is it it brings out new ways of making materials look like other materials, right? So meaning that because you have a single atom, it behaves very differently than the bulk atom. Right? So you can suddenly make like and I guess I mean um you know, you know, this is sort of known in the molecular world, but uh you know, I guess the heterogeneous catalysis is catching up to it, right? That uh that you suddenly have one, you know, iron becoming like platinum or or or like gold. And and so then you can have cheaper single atoms even uh that give you the same sort of functionality. And the design space now is almost unlimited, right? You can now do single atom alloy catalyst. So like like two atom alloys. Um and then and of course whatever is the host uh support uh that is hosting that single atom anchor. Um and I think now uh it's at the point where the single atom density. So that density question that is problematic in the in the bio world is now actually largely solved. Like you can get these single atoms to be isolated in pockets that are not too far off and get sort of densities to be uh very high. So in terms of material set, I think um single atom and single atom single alloy atom SAA uh or Single atom alloy, yeah. single atom alloy, yeah. Single atom alloy, those are I think very exciting material sets where I think there's almost you know, no no picture on on the CO2 reduction.",

One thing that I just wanted to like synthesize from the discussion of the alloys and the single atom catalyst and enzymes and proteins is that what we're basically saying is and also I think they're really good point to make sure to highlight Ashley from that Provine basically mentioned is we need industrial relevant benchmarking metrics that can be applied to any catalyst system. Um and so maybe it's turnover number or maybe it's dollar per active site of a catalyst or maybe it's um but like I think that's something that is necessary because without that like without benchmarking all these different catalysts and types of catalysts are um it's really hard to compare them, right? Um and so I think that that's um it's something really hard to we don't even do that when we compare thermal catalytic systems and electro catalytic systems and I would argue that it's actually quite easy to compare thermal and electro catalytic, but then we don't then we don't we definitely don't do it when we start to look at biocatalysis and um and these other um you know, enzymes and you know, different routes.
