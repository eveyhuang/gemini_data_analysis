Where to place it, how to place it. But because none of us are expert in simulation, we can almost think that deck is like a black box. And then they can assume like this black box captures 60% of CO2 at the rate of whatever. Then they can do it becomes more atmospherate modeling. But none of you are in that area. So how about this? If I ask you, right? The whole point of this, um, the event is that first of all, or you guys are rising stars in your field, we want you guys to think out of box and collaborate with each other, so create a whole new area of science and research areas, right? So if I ask you that you can do deck plus conversion or whatever system, you have to put it somewhere with the minimum environmental impacts. How would you do it?",

I think we need to have an additional access where we consider the implementation, the cost, technology readiness, feasibility, right? All of these things. But also at the same time other other um other considerations like, you know, logistics of deployment, like um public acceptance, right? incentives structures. In other words, uh we I think as scientists, we we're not only we not only need to focus on the the science part of it. I think it's also imperative to consider benefit cost analysis. I think this is important especially when it comes to DAC because we know that is just like I said is uh is from mass conservation point of view, that's an issue, right? Now, the amount of energy input is most is larger than the amount of um energy actually output. So the the output energy that we get and also again thermodynamic issue that I mentioned or energy intensiveness of this problem.

And where that hydrogen coming from make a huge difference in the overall sustainability of technology. And people talk about four different colors now, right? Black, gray, green, blue, hydrogen. And depending on which color you choose, it'll be totally different. And another thing is if you're putting that middle of nowhere, not only you need a CO2 conversion reactor, but you need to also have a hydrogen production reactor right there because you cannot transfer your hydrogen all the way out to ocean or somewhere else.

So question becomes CO2 which is very ground state, you have to activate, right? It could be CO bicarbonate carbonate or any of these species. How to transfer that to another either catalyst or another system can convert to some even higher energy level. Those are very different question because most of the questions are at the interface people have not thought about. And I think there will be a lot of fundamental questions we have to ask. How to merge biological system with electrochemical system or how to merge the material um chemistry with the catalyst chemistry. So there's a lot of interface areas you have to now start asking questions and it could be quite interesting.",

And then uh use that to address some questions that we can we can we can consider that are um uh the same no matter what the actual nature of the technology is. Uh like how do we place them in the field? What is the actual like local distribution of these these these uh in the same vein of a of a wind farm. Um what do we do with the materials that we're the compounds that we're generating in the the process or we like the the example was you could you could make carbon on a nuclear platform in the center of the ocean, but then what do you do with that carbon? Uh do you have to ship it? And then the other thing is the the global and local simulations of environmental impact because there's even when you're doing CO2 removal, you are not doing just CO2 removal. Um you are possibly competing with natural CO2 sinks. You are also possibly generating the parasitic removal of atmospheric oxygen which will will will dry out the local environment. And what uh what when you actually do produce, you know, the the the products of the DAC process, what are the follow-on environmental impacts if you have to put it on a truck and ship it somewhere and you're shipping now low density energy and it's uh being used up to the transportation fuel is high density energy. You are you are uh actually still being a negative uh in terms of CO2 production just because you're making you're capturing CO2 doesn't mean that it's going to end up releasing more in order to move the product of the DAC process. So, uh when I discuss this in the in the group, does this these thoughts pretty much capture what we were discussing here?",

There are many other things you can do because inside buildings has a lot higher concentration of CO2 than outside. We are point sources of CO2. In your room, much higher than 410 ppm, right? So people are looking into this. But the reason historically DAC was developed kind of a rural area or non-urban setting is because one of the benefit of DAC is that you can co-locate CO2 storage site with the CO2 capture site so that you can eliminate the transportation between, right? So there's a huge saving of that. So let's say if you have a place for injection of CO2, which is usually not in the city, this is where you want to build, like Iceland, middle of nowhere. So there are pros and cons involved. Those are good questions.",

They're saying, oh, it's free to come along, right? But if you're middle of nowhere, now you have to burn something or create that heat to do that. So that's why all the discussion Kristen is talking about. But at the same time, should we really use heat to regenerate? That's a new question a lot of people are asking. So until now, to provide energy, they're doing either temperature swing or pressure swing or combination. But can we use microwave? Can we use plasma? Can we use radio frequency? There, only thing you have to do is deliver the energy to which is binding onto CO2. That's a material question. Can that be non-thermal? That's a huge question in there. That's one thing a lot of research is going in that direction.

Like if we made all our plastic out of CO2, it might account for a couple percent of the CO2 we need to capture. So sequestration is a big part of it as you said. I think something that people haven't thought about in this area though is so you can make valuable chemicals, but you could also make chemicals that are easier to sequester than CO2 itself, which we have a limited capacity for. And I don't think that's really been explored at all.
