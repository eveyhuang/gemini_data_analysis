But I just wanted to throw in that there are clearly social license aspects along the lines we've been talking about in terms of getting buy-in from society. But one that I've seen that I'm also concerned about uh and Julia uh articulated this well in a way I hadn't heard is the mitigation avoidance um uh protestation which actually I find to be common among scientists that we shouldn't even be thinking about these things because it is an avoidance of what we should be doing to uh reduce emissions in the first place. And at least in the scientific circles that I work in, I meet up with a lot of resistance to even seriously talking about many of the uh fascinating and important and inevitable inevitably necessary technologies and science that we're talking about. I'm not sure that that's something we want to focus on here, but it's just something that I I I find to be uh an obstacle uh in in the circles that I work in.",

And I think what we really need is to be working with social scientists who are really thinking about the societal sort of like how society perceives new technology or new approaches, how they gain traction, how those perceptions shift over time and like really needing to work with um social scientists to formulate our research questions, to formulate our research approaches and make sure that the work that we're doing is really grounded in um the social dimensions uh of carbon removal and climate mitigation. So and I think from an and that includes economists that includes folks that are thinking about technology deployment, um that includes policy makers and folks that work in the policy space more generally.

Because if they can make something of value out of the CO2 that they're purchasing, their interest in buying that carbon is going to be independent of whether or not there's a tax associated with it from a federal level. Um and I think that kind of in this current climate in which we live where things are so polarized and can swing and up and flow in in a four-year time scale. If we're thinking about kind of elongating our interest out and kind of changing the way our economy thinks about carbon, it could be of I I I don't know.

Maybe there would be portfolio of solution, right? Hard, everything is hard because I think steel, cement, yes, aircraft, most of the time we refer to heavy transportation, also you know, heavy trucks or ship. You know, it's not just aviation. It's everything and they are working with jet fuel. Yeah, but it's always you know, jet fuel contain always fossil fuel and they are going to as they are going to pledge, you know, to be like carbon neutral by 2020 because they are going to offset their carbon planting more tree, you know, doing giving some money also, you know, to removing carbon, but this is not I think this is to be a way, but another way is that yes, carbon tax giving them some restriction and say, okay, you you don't want carbon tax? Okay, start to improve the efficiency of your equipment, okay? Because steel and cement are really old, above all in the USA are really old as um as industry and they are going to meet a lot in in particular there is one device that is called the boiler and this one is going to meet the 55% of CO2 from cement and steel. So just try to think out of the box. We need a boiler. Boiler means just firm. You need energy to make steam. Make energy. Okay, I don't want to you know, sell my you know, sell my uh research on expertise, but think out the box and say, okay, invite them to use a different source of um fuel instead of fossil fuel. What about hydrogen? What about ammonia? What about all these other particular or what about solar wind? Yes, if there is the possibility, okay, we we are going to do plan, I mean, I don't want to say a field of solar plant, but we can make energy in a different way. You know, push them. I know, it will be just a little bit down in the first year, but doing them also a projection where they can be after five years and maybe they can pledge, yes, we will be carbon neutral. And then we can be upset, we are going to upset our carbon, so we can be also negative as industry. I mean, these are just you know, my two cents about that we need energy somehow and we have also to think about that energy is coming from carbon, you know, is always coming from somewhere that requires also CO2 emissions. A negative emission is part of the game. It's not the main could be the main role, but it's just the part of the game. Yes, social politics, everything, uh they have to play all the part and we are there just to say, hey, why you do this one? Why you do this one? And for the long project, so you can gain, you are not losing money. You know, because you know, I mean, all the companies think just to gain money.",

I think a lot of what we are doing, at least on my side, is technology readiness zero. So, um, what we could look at is like if we go for a really ambitious goal, how would the world look like?

            "transcript": "This was on the cows and poultry. So Roger and Simona, and I think going back to some of the things that Rafael talked about, I think this is a space which is ripe for hybrid technologies. I mean, oftentimes when we talk about negative emission technologies, we have those six or seven technologies in mind, which are, you know, backs or direct air capture or just enhanced weathering. And they're very discreet. And they're very discreet groups of people who actually work on these very discreet set of technologies. But the fact of the matter is that there are a lot of co-benefits and co-gen and, um, I would say synergies that can be obtained by coupling some of these. So for example, if we can come up with pathways for direct air capture and soils. There's a lot that we can learn from the fluid particle interactions, from the mineral and the fluid interactions by just studying, uh, engineered weathering and applying some of those concepts, uh, for direct air capture and soils through weathering, for example. Uh, there could be synergies in the way we use biochar, right? I mean, biochar, I guess the controversy there with biochar is that, you know, you take biomass from location A and put it in location B doesn't necessarily mean that there's been a significant carbon offset, but there could be more creative ways of using biochar so it can be used to maybe capture CO2. I don't know. So I, one way to think about this is to hybridize some of these technologies, hybridize some of these pathways to maybe get them, get us to start thinking about co-benefits. That could be one way. Uh, and again, uh, in the context of biogas, if there, if there are ways, and again, not a plug for what we're doing, but if there is a way for us to remove the CO2 that is co-produced with say the methane and biogas, mineralize that and produce a carbonate at the same time, that is an unconventional way of looking at bioenergy with carbon capture and removal. So there could be pathways in which we could combine weathering with some of these more engineered pathways and vice versa. I think that if there is going to be potential investment, I would encourage, uh, perhaps some of it to go towards some of these hybrid pathways and uncovering the underlying science so that way there is a thermodynamic basis and there is a kinetic basis for these pathways going forward.",

But then we also have the third party verification. Right? So the third party verification needs to have experimental methodologies or simulation software or lifecycle analysis tools to verify that everything that is going on in that in that circle is is actually true. So and and that's something that we need a lot of. I'm I'm part of the peer review board member of Nori, which is the carbon market that's most active right now in the US. And what they are relying currently on is something called, I think it's called Comet. Right? So it's a software that simulates if you do this and this and this to your soil, this will be how much carbon you're sequestering. So it's based on a lot of assumptions and it's based on, yeah, a huge amount of uncertainty. But that's the best they have right now. So that's what they're relying on. But I see that this space needs to grow a lot. So you need much better tools, much better. So that's both experimental and and modeling and predictive tools to really verify that what's going on is actually true.",

So uh so I think the initial discussions we discussed a few of the industries where there are locked in CO2 emissions. So they may need to be paired with negative emission. Um and then uh we started out by wanting to identify whether there are sectors that we can use the same process captures you are doing fair uh or you can invent new processes without emissions. So identifying that boundary which may go to the next slide and then uh we all talked about ways to accelerate the timeline uh for progress for these these ideas. Media engagement, lots of discussion there. Um and then natural solutions tend to have uh a data preference for adoption versus technological solutions. And then um there were points that on uh so I was thinking about it from an investment business perspective, quantifying strengths um and quantifying these metrics are are crucial. And then second here we discussed about um sectors that are easier, quote unquote easy uh to to decarbonize versus not. So here we put electricity production. I guess I I added transportation as my own opinion, maybe maybe people currently. Um and then some that I guess many agreed as hard is steel cement um large vehicles and and food. Um and so should it should who uses negative emissions depends on which of these two categories you fall in. Uh and then uh and sort of, you know, this term decarbonization uh there's sort of two I guess enabling platforms, solar and wind uh based electricity which can be then combined to do X where X is whatever. Um transportation, other things and then other angle is producing carbon neutral uh fuels. Uh and then uh there's sort of, you know, other I guess some of the other discussions around uh using other forms of energy. Wait. There's too much for me. Oh my god. decarbonizing themselves and then co-benefits of hybridization uh and then we talked about this sort of integrated system view which led us into this tools category which I think was a neat output where, you know, if you had these tools, you can analyze these problems much faster. Uh there's at least some consensus that there's lack of good open source tools. There are some databases could be improved. Um and verification is the challenge.",

I mean, we are I know we we have a number of programs in the UK looking at at zero carbon steel making, looking at hydrogen reduction steel. I know Tata Steel are are actually supporting um quite a lot of that. Yeah. what they might do. And and I think there are some interesting opportunities as well because you get these silicate slags which you which you can then turn into carbonates and essentially use as a you know, as a a negative emission element to the process. So I think there are some interesting studies to be done in some of these hard to decarbonize industries, actually looking at all the steps of their processes and seeing what you could take out or what you could you can turn into a a zero emissions or where there might be a negative emission opportunity. Um it requires quite a lot of detailed understanding of the individual chemical processes or manufacturing processes themselves. But I liked your point about I liked your point about the the small scale emissions because in general, where we get emissions on a large scale, we have some chance of capturing them or you know, it may be it may be that the investment in finding a completely of doing it is is very worthwhile. Where you get lots of very small emitters, that can be that can be very much much harder to do with. I mean, it's much harder to do with emissions from the tailpipe of a of a car than it is from a from a power station. Of course. Actually, of course, there'll be there'll be small scale emissions from the different parts of natural environment that we aren't really able to deal with.

I mean, in the last 10, 12 years, I work in the energy environmental science and space and above all in thermochemical process and thermochemical transformation. I mean, my work is not directly related to carbon reduction from the atmosphere, so on negative emission technology, but my work is more related to make carbon neutral energy to see and to supply energy to this, you know, negative emission technology because as Dr. Brown showed us, you know, we can have life cycle assessment that we can remove from air two gigatons, you know, of CO2. But at the end, you know, maybe we are going considering the net CO2, we are going just remove 200 megatons, right? So my aim is just to give the energy because if we can think about negative emission from cradle to gate, all that technology needs energy. And I'm here to say, hey, I can make carbon neutral energy in order to, you know, to supply this technology and in order to get the 4% right there. Nice to meet you all.",
