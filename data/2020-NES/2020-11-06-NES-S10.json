And as you scale up CO2 electrolysis, whether you use uh something like Ocus 12, which is a pem electrolyzer in acid or something like dioxide, which is alkaline. Um as you scale this up to, you know, more than 10 to 50,000 units of production, the major cost in both of those systems is the membranes. So the idea that catalyst cost is not uh it's it's nothing. Even the bipolar plates are a small thing, separations aren't too bad if we can do this well. But for both of them, the real limiting step is the cost of membranes and both the the base materials, but then also the manufacturing at large scale. So I think that's where we can kind of, you know, look at which, you know, how did batteries get 10x cheaper in 10 years? Was it the cathodes that got cheaper? Was it a better electrolyte? I think we can learn, you know, like people have said from these other fields, how did they improve efficiency, reduce costs? Usually it's a material component or stability or durability. And and for electrolyzers, we I mean, all the modeling points in any case, whether we do this in alkaline conditions, the membranes are going to be the driver for for the cost.",

Now the issue with that is that if you look in literature, those are things where it's kind of like whack-mole. If somebody can do very good current current density, they have very low single pass conversion. If they have very good single pass, they have low current. So in the end, ideally would like them both. And then that is to us a frontier is that how can you do both of those things at the same time?
