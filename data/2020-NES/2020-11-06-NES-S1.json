You'll hear me talk about ionic liquids a lot, so that's what we work on. But, um, we're also looking at encapsulated ionic liquids. Um, and I think one of the issues there is, you know, we have to worry about the pressure drop and, um, think about alternative ways how to bring energy in and out relatively smoothly in these materials. So, um, thermal regeneration, you know, we may we may need to think about some other mechanisms that aid in thermal regeneration. So, um, you know, some of those sorbents like zeolites, you know, they they require significantly high regeneration temperatures and like ionic liquid capsules definitely lowers that. Um, but still, can we think about other ways to bring energy into the system for regeneration? So, um, I mean, the things that I have in mind and you can I guess it's not really thinking outside of the box too much, but you know, microwave radiation, radio frequency radiation, or even plasma assisted regeneration, um, Sharma mentioned electrochemical regeneration. Um, we can, you know, certainly make these capsule shells, uh, to be conductive and that's how we can bring that in.",

That's a little bit different from electrochemical capture in the liquid phase is that for CO2, there's a reaction and then that makes your energy of regeneration very high. So if there's some way that we can use some sort of weaker affinity that would still have selectivity, that would make a regeneration a lot more efficient. So like in the liquid phase, you have these weaker interactions. So your potential swing that you have to, your free energy swing is a lot less. But then for CO2, and then maybe it's a catch 22 and can't solve it because the concentration is so low for direct air capture. But if there's some way that we can think of to use other mechanisms other than like a reaction that captures the CO2 and changes it and then regenerates it, it would be more efficient for electrochemistry. But that's an open question.",

There could be a set of hybrid technologies that can get us from DAC to X. Some of them could be electrochemical, some of them could be hybrid absorption, crystallization, absorption, crystallization, membrane coupled with crystallization, depends on what that X is.

Um, but I I want to also, um, echo what Grishma just said. And I also want to mention too, don't forget that we can calculate the minimum work for any separation process, um, which is the thermodynamic minimum. Uh, and and so one way to think about that is that final concentration of CO2. If you're starting off at the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere and you're getting it to say 99% purity because you want to transport the CO2 in a liquid phase. But suppose that instead of transporting it in liquid phase, you want to use it and convert it as a feedstock to something else. So I would ask the question, what is the lowest purity that you actually need to get the CO2 to as the feedstock? Are you crystallizing it, you know, mineralizing it like Grishma just mentioned, are you turning it into a fuel? Uh, how low could you actually go to get the conversions you need to that to that X? And I think that that is an interesting parameter that's not often exploited because so many of us just look at thinking about transporting the CO2, but you might not have to. And that's something to I think think about.",

            "transcript": "Yeah, that that's a point I wanted to pick you back off of because we had a related discussion in a different breakout room. I'm David Kwabi from University of Michigan, Mechanical Engineering. So, uh, if you do the minimum work calculation for capturing CO2 from air to one bar, it looks pretty, uh, promising. It's like 20 kilojoules per mole or something like that. Um, but in reality, it's going to be you're going to have to spend a lot more energy, um, because you have a massive concentration factor to deal with. But if you want it, for example, to this is like, you know, say do jet fuel instead. Um, let's say we're not we're not going to get electric planes anytime soon. So, um, let's say your target was jet fuel and you wanted to use microbes like algae to do it. You actually don't need to go go all the way to 100%. Um, they can be pretty effective at like a couple percent, like 2%, 5%. So you can envision a situation where you're taking CO2 from air, but you're feeding it to algae, which are, you know, maybe not effective at 400 ppm, but super effective at 25%. Um, and then you're you have a useful end product as a result. So it kind of let it, you know, you're a little less constrained in terms of how high you need to go in concentration factor, um, but you're still effective, um, at doing something useful. So that's a sort of an end application driven, uh, design of of your DAC system.",

So you save a lot of energy and that energy directly translates to the operating costs. So it's, um, it's an interesting tunable parameter. Any other hierarchies or architectures that people want to talk about? I really liked the concept that Burcu, like that you had mentioned about, um, when we think about membranes, we often think, well, that doesn't work for direct air capture because you don't have a driving force. But when you think about a contained liquid membrane, you're combining, um, approaches. It's it's your combining something like absorption with a membrane separation process and and maybe there's benefits of thinking about the heat transfer across different systems, whether it's a packed bed or a membrane or a fluid in a in a packed bed.

I think you were saying, you know, there's a thermal transition or just a concentration driven transition. But I teased out the idea of, could you actually have that phase change induced electrochemically? Is what I kind of added to that or questioned about it. Yeah, I think that's an interesting approach that I hadn't really considered before. What I was referring to is more just a phase transition that's induced by absorption or absorption in this orbit material. So usually some type of structural phase transition or could also be, what specifically is coming into mind are certain metal organic frameworks that adopt rigid structures that have covalently attached flexible kind of amine groups on their surface that can bind chemically to CO2. And those amine groups are very dynamic and kind of moving all around in the absence of carbon dioxide. But when you get enough carbon dioxide such that you surpass a certain threshold partial pressure, it induces a phase transition in the amines so that they basically undergo effectively like a precipitation reaction and you form chains of ammonium carbonate. And so the thermodynamics of that phase transition are basically the opposite of the thermodynamics of CO2 absorption. And so that can reduce basically the overall net enthalpy change while you're still achieving a really high capacity and selectivity. So that's one example that comes to mind. There's other types of demonstrations with flexible metal organic frameworks where you have basically structures that are non-porous. And then when you achieve a certain threshold pressure of CO2 or gas on the outside of the framework, they expand to accommodate the gas. And that expansion again has the opposite thermodynamics, opposite enthalpy entropy change as absorption of the gas. And so that can provide some benefits in terms of minimizing temperature fluctuations during absorption and desorption. And I think similar types of things are possible in ionic liquids with precipitation reactions. But I think it's kind of been underexplored phase space in general. And so there's probably more opportunities for other types of mechanisms like Andrew suggested where you could have benefits and access properties that you wouldn't be able to have if you just have a simple kind of absorption or absorption process.",

So we have a recent paper looking at how we can use guanidian bases. This is in collaboration with some of the folks at Oakridge National Lab, where you have this, we actually sorb it in a liquid phase and then you form carbonate bonds, which cause the sorbent, the solvent has now become a solid, a crystallized solid. So then you crystallize it out and it has a much lower temperature of regeneration compared to the conventional carbonate. It's a water heavy system, but then when you work on systems like that, there are all these unconventional crystallization pathways and absorption pathways and coupling mechanisms that really open up new areas of fundamental science. So maybe direct air capture can serve as a pathway for unlocking some of those basic science questions too.",

Because then you don't have any counter ions. So the architecture of making it might be also like a challenge itself. So like a lot of the absorbent systems that are being done electrochemically now, they're done with some sort of liquid phase. But I feel like from the discussions, it sounds like if you can get rid of that liquid and have a direct gas stream passing by, if we can do that, that's more efficient, except you always need this sort of ionic conductivity. So how do you design something like that with new materials? It's a little bit of a challenge. So few folks have done it a little bit using polymeric materials and then using membranes like fuel cells and stuff. But if you want to have some sort of crystal, you have to impregnate it with something that has a counter ion. So that becomes like a design challenge as well.",

And then uh rather than using thermal energy to desorb, uh you change the hydration state by bringing in humid gas or liquid water. And that uh liberates the CO2 and you're essentially swinging between a carbonate and a bicarbonate in this process. Now, but then you now have a quaternary ammonium polymer that's in the humid humid state and in order to reabsorb and to restart the next cycle, you've got to remove a lot of water from a highly charged polar surface. And there's significant energy associated with doing that. And there's also significant kinetics associated with doing that and cycling the material quickly.",

In the context of direct air capture, how important are entropic contributions? Like in terms, you know, in terms of the energetic input, should we even, does it even make sense for us to think about engineering materials for an entropic capture point of view, or does it simply make sense for us to just think about trying to engineer the enthalpic component of it?

And so if you can do anything by inducing an increase in the entropy of a material when it binds CO2 to kind of compensate for that, then you can, you know, favor the absorption of more CO2 and potentially higher capacities at these lower partial pressures. But like Chris said, I think it is a very unexplored kind of area. It's less obvious to me. I mean, usually enthalpy and entropy of absorption should be quite highly correlated, just the more strong of a binding site you have for the gas, the more constrained it's going to be on the surface. And so there's usually not that much you can really do, which is why maybe it makes sense just to focus on binding energy because the entropy is just going to kind of tag along. But that's where I think if you have more dynamic absorbents or absorbents and things that respond and are not just inert materials, but actually change in terms of their dynamics or structure as a function of CO2 partial pressure, then you open up opportunities for thinking about engineering entropy.",

We can literally distinguish between them by running, you know, a lot of simulations as well. So this can also come in to guide some of the initial experiments, and then maybe, you know, experiments can guide the similar theory again. You know, that has to be a cycle, right? That has to be a cycle to refine it. So that is a very interesting route, and something, you know, I would agree. Basic energy point of view, definitely, you know, really appealing. Can I ask a question based on that? Because a lot of the computational material screening for separations that I'm familiar with leverages the fact that people work with primarily crystalline materials that allows for this high throughput screening to be more effective. Absolutely. If we're if we're talking about materials where we want to look at entropic terms, there's a higher likelihood that we're going to be dealing with amorphous domains.

Um, you know, in a lot of engineered systems, you have control over temperature, pressure, other parameters. One of the challenging things about direct air capture is, you know, we're we're stuck with, um, 400 ppm, uh, CO2. But one of the things I haven't seen discussed a lot is if you imagine deploying direct air capture in different places around the world, you can imagine having conditions that range from, say, minus 20 to 40 degrees C. So if you were asked to try to do something with CO2 at 400 ppm at minus 20 degrees C, how would you think about doing that differently from, you know, the ambient conditions that we're normally used to thinking about indoors, 25 degrees C, you know, 30% relative humidity. And similarly, if you were designing, uh, a process that could operate in, you know, Oman in the middle of summer, you know, you you might be dealing with 35, 40 degrees C, uh, ambient temperatures. Um, so I just throw that out there as a way to maybe stir different ideas. This is a challenge where we're going to probably have 10 or 20 or 50 solutions that might be customized to different locations around the globe. So, would you change your way of thinking if you were stuck working at minus 10 C or or 40 C? So I'll just throw that out there as a possible question.",

            "transcript": "Chris, my short answer to that is absolutely yes. So we've been looking at pathways to couple direct air capture with carbon mineralization, specifically with the intent of trying to produce carbonates. And one way to do that is to use conventional sorbents that are cheap. So you could use amino acid solvents like sodium glycine or even MEA. And so you have a high concentration of carbonate ions that you can now react with your calcium or magnesium, produce calcium, magnesium carbonate, have sufficiently high hydroxyl ions, so you can regenerate your solvent. So you have for a one pot process with internal recycling, internal pH swinging. So that's so that really drives down the cost of capture and mineralization, but it needs higher temperatures because of the thermodynamics of CO2 absorption because you're trying to couple absorption and crystallization. This is a process that would not work in very cold climates. Like if you're trying to do this in the Arctic, there simply is not going to be enough thermodynamic driving force for that. Uh there are other approaches to couple mineralization. So for example, again, if you're trying to feed CO2 to an algae pond, depends again where that algae pond is going to be located, if it's going to be located in a temperate region versus in a really cold climate. So cold climate is a real challenge and I am not entirely sure what subset of solutions can be deployed there. But if you but I do think there are a set of solutions that can be deployed in more temperate and tropical regions. Uh so that's my two cents on the thinking and we do a lot of thinking around this space, so I'd be very keen on hearing what we can actually do in really cold regions.",

So the boltzmann distribution is going to favor CO2 going to um you don't need as large of a delta E between different gas molecules to drive a lot of CO2 um into a material. It's the regeneration piece though that that's less clear to me exactly how that changes. I think selectivity and capacity are a lot easier. Um you can have weaker binding sites. Um but whether or not that actually leads to benefits on the regeneration side when you're already colder, um I have to think a little bit more about. I guess if you're in a cold climate but you had some geothermal heat source or something readily available then you um that might offer a lot of advantages.",
