So, synthetic chemists would like to make those materials and they focus on getting a certain product distributions, but not necessarily the mechanisms or rates. So, I think that there's like a there's a difference in strategy which gives us less information that we can potentially benchmark to. Uh but I think theory can definitely pitch in when it comes to identifying product distributions, the various pathways, uh selectivities and so on. It's just finding the right match in terms of like uh finding this one experimentalist group that is interested in going the whole way, right? Right from synthesizing what you think works to to showing that that is indeed the pathway. So, I I think it's nice that like most fields are moving towards teams of people. Uh but yeah, I think you need a team because each person has their own individual interest as far as experimentalists go and while theorists have the ability to bridge all these gaps, you can't just work with one person at least from what I've seen in my limited experience.",

I don't know if uh anybody of us really understand it. I don't think anybody does, but we can we can make it with the glasses of usefulness, right? So, it's definitely useful. It has been proven to be useful. And it's just a natural thing of um you know, a multi-dimensional analysis especially for structure property relationships. So um you can see it how it works, right? So it's a multi-dimensional thing that it's I don't know, 12, 13 dimensions, but you can reduce it to a component um that it could be understand by understood by a human brain. So, one of the things I I think I I will have to go back to the original um comment that I give, which is the negative results, right? So there was a very beautiful paper recently, well, not recently, three years ago where it was an organic synthesis, but you can train a machine learning model that takes into account the negative results of experiments. So at the end of the day, you were able to predict the the right reaction path and the right conditions that are the most optimal, right? So I think that's where um machine learning could be used because if you ever do any simple models with machine learning, you will learn that the more data, the better, right? So the more data that it's accurate, the better, the more data that it's um you know, uh that you can reproduce it better. So basically any data is good. So I think that it's something missing um that we can exploit both as experimentalists and as a computationally tradition-minded scientist that um we might be discarding um a lot of data that could be useful. Uh one quick example for theory could be, you know, when you do your your simulation of MD, you're trying to wait all these different snapshots that could be so useful. One example for experiments, those negative results um or where where we were seeing is the all these decay, maybe that decay can give you the the next design principle. But you know, those bottom line is um I think uh the current thing in machine learning probably that could be useful is just we need to find ways to get more information, more data that is more accurate and maybe look at places that we thought um you know, they were they were um rubbish, they were waste, but maybe they are useful.",

I find machine learning is very useful to my research because uh I'm doing the so-called AB initial molecular dynamics to study the various electro compasses. And of course, this type of calculation, um we basically need to sample for example, hundreds of thousands structures in order to get one hourly the quantity instead we just using one snapshot uh to tell you the the the uh the property. And in order to sample all this uh numerous structures, if you want to uh calculate all the structures using for example, density functional theory, it will be extremely computationally expensive. So machine learning can help us uh in a way so that we do not need to do explicit uh quantum mechanical calculation for all the structures. We just need to do uh uh calculation for a set for a selected selected set of structures and use the structures to train the machine learning model so then you can predict the of other structures without doing the gateway DFT calculations. So I find this is very helpful and needs to my research.",

Now, with a particle of 10 micron size, we are collecting 1.5 million excess absorption spectroscopy for metal cations. So every time we do the experiment with over a week, we get back with 8 to 10 terabyte data. So it's at the point that we have to develop our own machine learning or other advanced data analysis methods to analyze data. Unfortunately, we are still very slow on that end. We are still analyzing data that we collected a few years back. Now, speaking of the other high throughput capability that there are a lot of experimental opportunities at different synchrotron facilities where you can collect a thousand high quality absorption spectra just in one day. Again, beamline scientists and myself, we have been talking about how to streamline the data analysis using high throughput mode, but we are still not making progress on that yet.

We, for almost a century now, we've been using transition state theory and assuming that all of these modes are harmonic. And we all implicitly know that there are deficiencies to this. And the thing though is that like more advanced, more accurate rate theories exist. So there's variational theories, there are semi-classical theories, all of them exist, we just don't use them because they are too expensive. So, I think there is definitely room for finding ways in which we can make these more expensive theories more tractable. I think a lot of advances in machine learning, signal processing, all of these can be applied to like quantum chemistry to make all of this happen. And make those more cost effective. And therefore make quantum chemistry predictions of rates more accurate. We generally throw out our rate coefficient predictions because we know that they're quite meaningless. We only compare barriers, we only look at potential energy surfaces. But I think there's room for rate predictions, accurate tunneling contribution calculations and so on. Like all of those sophisticated things which now exist only for model systems can be made more practical with all of the other advances that are going on in algorithm development.",

Um, so, yeah, from from computation, I think the the interface is still all the methods that we're still using is, you know, um, electronic structure, uh, MD and to some degree Monte Carlo, but I think the new wave of method development that I see pretty much everywhere is just implementing machine learning for something, right? Machine learning for development, uh, for understanding the, uh, the wave function or machine learning to understanding, you know, a guess of transition state and so that's where method development I have seen, um, going in pretty much every area, you know, MD and and so on. Um, so, I don't know. My my my take on this is that is definitely the the way to go, but also because machine learning is so useful, so tempting, at the same time, we still don't understand the basics of it, right? It works. We just don't know why why it works at the fundamental level. So, my, um, I guess concern would be if all these new models or new, uh, developments or methods work, do we really truly understand everything? Because really machine learning part we don't fully understand it. We we just know it works. So it's just a question of, um, of once these method work and are developed and fully, uh, implemented, the question will be really, do we really understand all these?

So we actually have collaborators working on the theory side. Leo actually is one of our collaborators. We actually published a paper together last year. So, one of the challenges we see in our experimental side is trying to understand the reaction intermediates, trying to figure out the reaction mechanism. Some of the tools we frequently use trying to probe the reactive intermediates, but we have the trouble because the reactive intermediates usually have very short lifetime. And they are not really have high coverage on the surface of the catalyst. So that's make even infrared or Raman become extremely difficult to to see those intermediates. I think theory have much better chance to readily telling us what's going on the surface. And also, I think on the other side, I heard there are a few groups actually here also working on developing new tools to understand the electrochemical interface. I think it's definitely there's a need for us who work on the catalyst and also collaborate closely with people working on computational modeling and ab initio calculations.

So turning to some x-ray absorption and emission spectroscopy to try to look at intermediates. I think some things that could be useful from a computational perspective to maybe complement these types of techniques is first even just modeling and predicting complex spectroscopies based on the molecular orbital geometry of the reactants, intermediates, and product species that we're expecting to see. I think also the hard part about this is really just bridging the gap between idealized models and then really messy systems. And so that really comes down to what Fang was also saying about signal to noise. So other things I was thinking about was techniques like modulation excitation spectroscopy that we can use for experiment, but that actually do they would be significantly enhanced if there's appropriate sort of theory or data processing to supplement that. And I think it's having expertise from a theoretical perspective would help an experimental group like mine really make the most of these approaches.",

From computational side, it's generally difficult to achieve good balance between the accuracy and the efficiency. Sometimes we have to sacrifice the accuracy for efficiency so we can start for example, we can start studying large system, we can start studying materials. But sometimes it's very important to consider those complex factors although they may cause significant computational cost. For example, in I'm more familiar with electrocatalysis and only the liquid interface. So usually people often neglect for example, the surface charge and also neglect the solvation explicitly solvation. And this approach, this conventional approach is simplified, but it's very successful in studying many different electrocatalysts because the computational cost is relatively low. However, there are also many experiments that cannot be explained using such simplified approach. And for those materials, we really need to consider the for example, the surface charge, the explicit water solvation effect. And without those consideration, we cannot explain the experiments. So I think there is a strong need to develop and apply more advanced computational measure to better understand the experiments.",

One of the things naturally about most electrochemical interfaces is they're horrible and they're complicated.

That's actually a really appealing aspect of using microscopic approaches to actually mapping reactivity. So if you actually go down and locally measure where catalysis is actually efficient within these kind of microscopic material systems, you can kind of jump in a little quicker on that kind of feedback loop that we like to always envision works well where you have an experimental observation and then we theoretically predict or rationalize it and predict better structures, right?

So the lessons I guess from that one when I when I ask him he said, well, this model work really well, but he never actually calculate anything from, you know, from those organization energies and all these salvation things. So I was wondering, it's extremely useful and is certainly a model system that it's approximate more things. So I don't know if um, you know, we're talking about very um a more accurate simulations with realistic stuff and also very simplistic models that can probably do more accurate and and and efficient. I was wondering because that electron transfer theory, it actually is in the middle ground, right? It's complexity but also a model system. So but it's so successful and explaining many things.

But if you are talking about uh uh the concentration gradient layer uh applying to the equals system that could be the pH gradient at the surface. That can range from uh few nanometers to tens of microns, even 100 microns. There are a lot of things going on in there, the dissolution of the catalyst and different solvation structure of the catalyst and um and the cluster formation in the solution phase and how that cluster will dissolve and re-deposit back to the electro surface. There's a lot of things in that gradient layer that's completely unknown at this point. So, um we have been doing research uh developing uh mostly based on single term techniques to to visualize the specially uh spatial resolution and with temporal resolution as well at that gradient uh layer, what what's going on with the metal ions in that layer. Uh can range from uh protons, hydroxidions and metal ions dissolve from the from the electrodes and uh there's a lot of things who can can be done at that interface to to to modify the surface of the catalyst.",

The way the whole field of development has evolved is that you have this artificial divide between quantum chemist and quantum physicist. Like quantum chemist work on these idealized gas phase systems and physicist work on these continuous systems. So no one bothered to benchmark things to the interface. So I think even the gas solid interface is a challenging thing for us to model, let alone a gas liquid interface. So I think there is some progress in figuring out like what these benchmark systems might be through like these single crystal uh experiments so to speak, which allow for us to at least look at how things bind at that interface and how our theories perform. So I I think electrochemistry electrochemical interfaces is a whole other ball game altogether, although I don't know much about them. Um but yeah, model systems, I think even for a gas solid interface is quite a challenge and any progress in that would be amazing. Um yeah, and the other issue of course is that all of these things are dynamic. So one way around it for defining a model system would be to try and pick out those catalysts that have uniform active sites. So in part of my group gets away with it because we look at molecular catalyst, but when it comes to interfaces, there's there's we have to look at the ensemble. And even if we do look at the ensemble, we still don't know how to get it up to experiments. So we are trying to do dynamics, but then dynamics again, there's so little you can do with initial dynamics. You can't really simulate realistic time scales. So trying to figure out if there are like picosecond time scale experiments that we can actually benchmark the theory and and then take it forward from there might might also be a way forward.",

Um and so by uh changing molecular identities of the pendant groups, you could start to change the local proton uh availability or um uh the sort of stabilization or destabilization of reaction intermediates.

So I think I would be certainly really excited to uh try to collaborate with theorists uh on on that and maybe starting even from something really simple like um you know, substrate binding studies that don't even have to progress beyond or or that initially would not progress uh into the realm of catalysis, but could just look at what's the role of the local environment and how can we build models to address that question.",

But that if you put these into a model system, let's say a training model or something, you will know that that directions will not be working, but it's still useful information.

But it almost sounds like it was more leaning more towards, um, if we're really trying to get into like a next generation of catalytic systems where you're going to be able to do things like break scaling relations, you're probably going to have to have inherently more complex systems so that you have multiple types of functional active sites that are controlled so that you can basically have cascades of different active sites for different steps in the pathway that are kind of optimized over. Okay? And then you get into the realm of I need to kind of explore systems that have huge parameter spaces, whatever they are, like they're if they're something like high entropy alloys or something where you've just got these poly elemental combinations of elements like organized in a particle or something, can we come up with efficient ways of exploring those systems? That's a place where I think my croscopy could actually be really, really, really powerful because if you make kind of just heterogeneous assemblies of these systems, you can kind of quickly screen through them and identify, you know, what's promising and then, you know, use theory to explain, predict, guide where we're going forward.",
