So something that a change that occurs but actually enables it to be positive, more positive to the growth, to a rate constant, to a positive feedback. Could that be one of the major transitions as well where it's not always derailing the system as we often see in synthetic chemistry.

And so I was thinking and this could be framed in those terms too, are there jumps that could happen in the functionality of a pre life or prebiotic chemical system that can occur if you have reaction networks that optimize in specific condition spaces or environments, but then are brought together for the first time and or each system that was optimized to its condition space, then the conditions change a bit like Andro was saying. And could you then could that lead you to a boundary that then you go you push to a new state with the system. And could that be something that is the rarity of origin of life where you can get a far a long way in certain chemical systems, but until you combine it with other ones in different conditions, you can never really get past that point. And then my other question was to for catalysis, let's say like enzyme type redox reactions, to improve catalytic function of a reaction, um, to what extent can the catalytic activity of inorganic substrates like iron sulfur clusters be enhanced by the creation of of geologically driven organics to a point, but then where's the limit of that and to what extent do you require an inheritance system to be able to reproduce the same type of catalyst or protein and how far can you get without having a reproducible organic ligand let's say around that cluster.",

            "transcript": "Sure. Um, my brain is swirling, but I guess just two things. Um, one in response to what Greg was saying, I don't know if this is what you're thinking about, but I used to spend a lot of time thinking about these evolutionary dead ends and how it is that these early replicating networks or these self replicating molecules actually continue to evolve towards greater complexity as opposed to being streamlined to just being really good, really fast replicators. So maybe some of you've heard of a Spiegelman's monster where if you have replicators in test tubes and optimize them over time, you end up with leaner and meaner replicators, but they don't increase in complexity or functionality and I used to wrestle with this a lot, but one thing that people often would say is, well, the environment matters, right? And so the dynamism of an environment can can select for greater functionality over time. So that's something that I kind of mull over. Um, the other thing I was thinking about, I think might be related to what Betul first mentioned, which is this question of at least for me, how do we link natural selection with energy acquisition? Like I I've read a lot of papers about again, self replicating networks, hypercycles, um autocatalytic cycles, how we would get selection in these early stages. And then I've read a lot about proton gradients and harnessing energy across membranes and so on. And what I have yet to make the connection of in my mind is how you bring these two together and is it in the form of an early protocell, is it in, you know, sort of just like limitation on a mineral surface? How do we how do we bring those two things together and and maybe for me too is what methods do we need to use to answer those questions? Because I think that, you know, I use the tools of bioinformatics, so I'm doing very top down work with genomics, but I don't think that at least for my work, I don't think we can get that far. So it might be up to the experimentalist like Laurie to, you know, make your events in the lab and and you know, and create these things and and tell us how that could work and then we could see if we see something similar in the genomic record, but I struggle with this the meeting of the top down and bottom up approaches, so those are just things on my mind.",

Of course you can always argue that we're not as good as chemists as nature, but I feel like there are some parameters missing.

I you know, I I'm an I'm an analytical chemist and I'm always thinking about how can we measure something? And when we talk about this kind of continuum or spectrum between life and non life, I mean, do we I'm trying to think of ways like ways to actually differentiate something in the middle versus something that's alive versus not alive. You know, something that's kind of on that path but maybe not there yet. And I think that's really difficult. I mean, you know, just I'm I'm a chemist and you know, thinking of when you when you throw in these really complex systems, right? the analytical tools that I'm familiar with, it's hard to actually capture that system interaction experimentally, right? You know, like so I'm I'm a mass spectrometrist for instance, right? And you know, people do mass spectrometry of cells and things all the time, right? And what they do is they, you know, they lice the cells and they look at the lipids, they look at the metabolites or they um, you know, they digest the proteins and the peptides and look at those, but you can't really see those molecular interactions through mass spectrometry, right? And so, you know, people have to do things like where they um tag molecules and look at like fluorescence microscopy or you know, things I mean, I'm I'm just my head is thinking about how do we how do we actually see something that's in in the middle. And I think that's really hard and maybe that's part of the reason why there's I mean there is kind of some gap I mean there's a lot of gap there. I like I I remember Greg I I heard you give a talk once about kind of your your work kind of thinking about that the space between that, right? And um yeah, I I I I feel like even even if we had a system present that was kind of in the in that space, could we really tell? I don't know I don't I don't know the answer to that question. You know, that that's that's kind of what's on my mind and I don't I don't mean to like transition the conversation away from where we are, but that that's what I'm thinking about, yeah.",

You know, for example, if you make this, you know, if you have these monomers and they just shoots to a polymer and then the polymer just stays there, it does it's probably not going to do anything, right? And you know, I'm thinking of you know, like when like when we do like I do a lot of reactions in wet wet dry cycling, right? And part of the power of that is actually in the wet phase is hydrolysis, so water breaking down like some of the polymers back into monomers and shorter sequences. And you know, that that kind of that breaking aspect is actually a really critical part of that process. And you know, like I I almost don't want a reaction that's like too good, you know, like there's almost like a balance there, right? And so I I I I agree with what you're saying but I I think the word robustness can almost like you almost don't want it to be like overly robust, right? else you're just going to accumulate a lot of stuff that's not going to do anything.

But then there was this discussion of messy chemistry and that's it seemed to me as an outsider like the opposite. And it almost seems like for both prebiotic chemistry and for selection, you need to have somewhere in the middle. You need to have the right amount of variation, the right amount of messiness, but it can't be so messy that you end up with tar, you know, as Steve Benner likes to say. So it's like for both for both the prebiotic chemistry part of it and then later as you're getting to these replicating networks, you need to have some happy medium between the messiness and the and the sparsity.",

But biology like you said, would take them along a certain, we were talking about this in the last meeting, along a very certain path. So there would be a very distinct way to to to monitor a sample of of some sort of organism, whatever it is, but looking at that chemistry is going to be very conservative, presumably, even if it is eating feeding off the environment of more complex organic compounds.

And um, you know, when you're looking at, you know, like when you're looking at peptides from a biological system, that's not the case, right? And so, and even when you get when you go to a further level, like there when you when you break these molecules apart, you can see differences in their sequences and things like that, right?

There's atmospheric detection of things that we think are just made by life and it just kind of depends on what your spacecraft constraints are and there's all sorts of technical problems here.

But that's something that we'll have to think about in the future is as, you know, maybe in 30 years maybe we can be more quantitative about that. Um and as as as we can have like a kind of like a quantitative or positive, we'll have to quantitate an error as well.

So on the earth actually, uh like right behind me, the white things that you see kind of on the surface are um sabka uh deposits left behind on these kind of like ephemeral lakes, little playas that are in between these mega mega dunes.
