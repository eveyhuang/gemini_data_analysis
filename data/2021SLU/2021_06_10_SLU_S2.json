Information that copies itself and that makes structures that makes itself. So it's a very interesting concept that it may help us look for it. But we can do that later in that discussion. We have an hour and something uh to discuss all these things. So shall we start from the chemistry, which is one way to do it or shall we start from the other side, which is the astronomy astronomy?

And I think that per Dimitar's comment about um, you know, how is this even relevant to life on earth? I think that the other solvent question could be relevant to life on earth because, you know, from some of uh for instance like McHugh's work, uh there's been work on kind of hypersaline environments and alternative solvents that come from a lot of solute from an aqueous solution that when you concentrate it, you have something that's still liquid that you can do interesting chemistry in.",

This is true for like the NASA RCNs, exobiology and everything else. And then we have all these planetary science questions about other worlds and life on other worlds, but there is no funding that I've ever found where you could study the possible origin of life on another world in a non-earthlike manner. And so that's that's been a real problem for someone who's interested in life detection like me because, you know, I want to say, well, on Mars for example, could you have life begin in some other way than earth, but you can't really do those experiments. And I think that's a real like issue in in linking these two things. So that's kind of a general thought. And then as far as uh go ahead.",

But I also wonder, you know, there could just be main similarities between life here and life on exoplanets, but the but the origin of life was actually different than it was on earth and maybe the initial steps of chemical evolution were different. So it could be carbon based, it could be in water, but it's still not the same as earth. And so there's a lot of experiments that could be done, even big things early on like minerals direct reactions, but how exactly and which minerals are prevalent. And you know, you could imagine like I think on early earth, the redox state of the planet was a huge factor because you have let's say iron two very rich in the oceans and an atmosphere of mostly CO2. And what is the redox state of the atmosphere? What is the redox state of the mantle? Like these are huge drivers for what sort of reactions you might have even with all the same chemicals that we are used to.

Um, I I think also, you know, it's very important like Laurie says, the modeling is very important because for the experimental studies, uh we can only conduct maybe like months or maybe years, but uh it's not, you know, long enough to really predict what's going on, right? In the geologic time. Uh I think for the geochemist, we we have some models that can predict what is going to happen at equilibrium um states, but uh um but the time scale actually, I think it's a big question mark there.

And also the modeling would tell us stability of a product at a condition, but it didn't take into account the instability of the molecule, like we were talking about. And so there was nowhere in the model to input the fact that like this molecule degrades at a well known exponential curve that we see in the lab, but that's not included in the model.

I I'm not sure which method they are using to determine the temperature of exoplanets. But by my point even for the planets in our solar system, even for the planets and moons in our solar system, we don't have determine very well the surface temperature. You know, because so uh of course we have some in situ measurements for the mass surface temperature, but if you check the global, I mean global scale temperature, that's other problem. So that's mean what's the radiation budget on the top, what's the radiation transfer inside of atmosphere, then what's the precisely what's the temperature on the surface. I I mean and global scale. That's actually even for Mars, we don't have very good very good knowledge for that. Of course the for the same thing for the Venus, for the Titan, you know for maybe for yeah. So I mean if we if we can figure out one one way to better determine the surface temperature of exoplanets. That I mean it will help help us to find life help us to find liquid water and life and so on. So that's my my idea, you know I'm trying something for the planets in our solar system, not for exoplanets, but I think maybe it's worth of trying for exoplanets.",

Um, and uh, I I think for for the experiments, uh, you know, if like radiation is a big concern for the planet uh, the planets to form, the stars to form, uh, we can maybe uh, put more emphasis, right? On studying maybe different wavelengths of the UV and you know, radiation time, uh, and for, you know, the the daily cycles, maybe seasonal cycles, um, they always, you know, they also tools we can simulate those processes, you know, we can also study like a cooling and warming processes, uh, you know, with the, you know, different temperature gradients to simulate this process as well. Um, but we don't know, you know, the results for those uh, you know, how how that, you know, related to the real situation, the real world out there. So, um, but you know, definitely worth exploring, you know, there are lots of opportunities there. Yeah.",

But well I think we can definitely try if it's worth is very important and very interesting. Um, and we we can design some model system to study that. You know, we we have done some like a model organic compound that we know exactly what kinds of radicals can be formed and then we can use some you know different uh parameters, right?
