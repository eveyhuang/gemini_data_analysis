And then also potentially looking at not just finding biosignatures on a single planet, but using ensembles of planets um to perhaps allow us to get at the probability of life um in a given population of planets. Then finally, I think our most important um frontier is really developing all of the bits and pieces that we are going to need for a probabilistic framework for biosignature assessment. Um and what I mean by that and and this is sort of some components of it but there are certainly many others that we can discuss at the workshop over the next couple of days. But we need to, you know, fundamentally assess the significance of the detection.",

Uh if you're on a hill slope and you have trees that tend to fall, you know, they'll promote slowly erosion.

I during uh Zoom meetings, I I often use the chat quite a bit because I don't like to interrupt and I think it's actually a good way for other people to be able to have a little bit of a sidebar but there's also a record of of the chat. So, um if I do put things in there, I am listening. I I just uh find that's also a useful uh notepad. Um in terms of so so the earlier discussion is is great. I I think that's really helpful. Um I just maybe take a a step back to to look at the framing of the the question. So so the idea was that uh what are the commonalities um of worlds that um are basically alive or have a ecosystems. And um I guess the two uh key things that come to mind uh would be uh when and where uh because those commonalities are going to be radically different depending on when in the history you're you're you're considering on that body. And the the other key issue is where by which I mean um that the planetary system itself. So, um this sort of if we take a step back and think about would we expect commonalities between living worlds? And the answer may be yes, but I I think that it's quite likely that you would have classes of living world. And so the commonalities aren't going to be the same over all worlds. If you have a world that is uh drowned in deeper oceans, so a super Earth that ends up putting more water onto the surface and you simply don't have continents, then um it doesn't mean that that it will undergo the same types of uh development and share commonality with a world that does have continents. And so um on some basic level we could think about um initial conditions plus life leading to either states of divergence or convergence and are there particular classes that might exist at a particular time that would be indicative of of life. But I wouldn't expect a super Earth uh especially one which was an ocean world to have the same types of bio signatures, the same commonalities uh that that that we see on on worlds with continents or other radically different living worlds. So, um just to think about the question, would we actually expect there to be commonality uh between living worlds or are there classes of living world that um through the biological calculation process where life is trying to create a stable environment that you lock into one of these classes um and we should be comparing between those classes rather than across all worlds.",

So you could imagine uh an early completely anaerobic biosphere um that is producing methane that accumulates and is detectable as an anomaly, there shouldn't be that much methane. Um, and maybe you can make an argument for that being a bio signature. But once oxygenic photosynthesis evolves, that methane might be getting scrubbed, might be getting oxidized in the water column or locally. Um, and those might be an equilibrium where you see neither methane nor oxygen in the atmosphere. I think Kim kind of pointed at that one of his slides, but in terms of a big picture concept, maybe there is a detectability window early, but then the redox balances wipe it out later if you do evolve oxygenic photosynthesis. Um, how much you would get? I don't know. Like today methanogenesis is thriving off of a highly productive ecosystem that's running on oxygenic photosynthesis. That's why there's so much organic material to be reduced to methane. So we can't even use the current methanogenic pathways as a proxy for what be going on in the early Archean in terms of how much to expect. I I have no idea, but um that would be my I think the only the only obvious one I can think of would be an early methane signature.",

But I guess maybe one thing the exoplanets give us, we have thousands of them. And so maybe we can pick um we can have enough of them that we can pick planetary systems that look identical to us, but the difference is just a stellar age and so we could maybe see if we can sort of stitch together evolution in time by not looking at one planet, but by looking at 10 planets that look from what as far as we can tell identical other than the stellar age and therefore the planetary age is sort of a rough proxy as a first step to getting a handle I guess on evolution.",

In the same way that a thriving terrestrial world with surface photosynthesis uh would be easily detectable.

Uh, but it is actually intrinsically tied with entropy, which is intrinsically tied with energy and and so I think those are actually dealing with a similar overall metric. Uh, for for Joe's comment about ocean worlds, they're really tricky because again, you have fewer states. So continents and subaerial weathering uh in the context of what we're talking to about CO2 drawdown and the Wilson cycle and being able to look at reaction, that there's really critical.
