Methane obviously is an important potential bio signature and and um, I think both our keynotes touched on that. So it actually just occurred to me, we kind of assume that methane either comes from archea, like life, archea mostly, um, or that it comes from, you know, like serpentinization reactions, which my understanding actually is that's not, well, we can debate about that about the source of that. So previously it's been assumed that that actually abiotic flux of methane is pretty low across the board and through history too as Tim was saying. I was just thinking actually, knowing what we know now, um, about the delivery of organics early on, we know actually thermogenic methane is very abundant, right, in oil reservoirs. But we think that that mostly comes from algae and phytoplankton, right? Um, this is the whole oil industry. Um, I'm actually wondering could thermogenic methane come come from the caragen delivered early on from meteorites? Um, that's my that's my thought as of as a false positive on other exoplanets if we see a bunch of methane, right? Could it just be comets and meteorites delivering caragen caragen, quote unquote caragen is actually I think very abundant in in meteorites in carbonaceous meteorites.",

And in the solar system we have too small a sample size to do argument for analogy for what uh, abiotic rocky planets do. Every time you go to a new world like IO or Venus, we're confronted with a new mode of tectonics. So if we can't use argument for analogy, what other first principles we come out? Well, stoichiometry, sure. Uh, we thermodynamics, uh, and energetic limits. But those are those constraints are much looser uh, than uh, we normally think and one reason is that we can't make the steady state assumption. Uh, impulsive events like super plume head arrival or even just an intermittent uh, limit cycle in the tectonic mode, um, or of course uh, impacts like was being discussed in Timothy uh, Lence's uh, keynote uh, can um, you know, give you transient high fluxes even late in a planet's life.",

Um, you know, we may be able to understand significant amount of the context that relates to atmospheric chemistry, but to the chemistry that relates to the solid planet uh and the impact that that has for example on abiotic fluxes and and as Eddie said what's reasonable to expect from abiotic processes. Um how much constraint can we levy on that context based on things that we can observe and and given the uncertainty that results um how does that propagate into uncertainty into what the abiotic fluxes are uh you know, both both productive and and destructive fluxes.

And so this goes two directions, it's the downward direction and the upward direction. In the downward direction people use, you know, the chemicals that are on the surface of the ice um and say, oh if if those chemicals can get into the ocean then the ocean is habitable. Um but to make that inference you need constraints on whether those materials can diffuse or otherwise get through the ice shell. Conversely, if you want to try to detect bio signatures, you have to think about what the bio signatures are in the ocean and what products of those bio signatures could get to the surface and how you would distinguish them from exogenic material. And so there's this whole exchange problem that needs to be understood, what thermal gradient is required in the ice shell for example and what conditions like tidal heating or endogenic heat flow, what are the conditions that enable that thermal gradient. Um and these questions have definitely been explored for certain mission targets and especially in the context of mission studies, um but from my understanding, I think like a more broad and a little bit uh study with also with less of a specific agenda um is warranted for understanding how we would detect both habitability and um bio signatures.",

Um and so we can look at what's on the surface which is basically nothing but and and infer what is diffusing through the ice shell and use that as kind of a study to to make sure that your models for which chemicals can diffuse through the ice shell actually makes the right predictions for Enceladus where we have some constraints on the ocean chemistry.",

So so that's why I'm suggesting uh or I mean doesn't it doesn't seem controversial, I'm not it seems people like the idea. Um you're just having uh a library of worst cases. So you take Vicky's example ofzation um to and sticking with hydrogen production because that's I understand that better than methane production. Um you would start by saying well how much lava can a planet make? What are the energies going to that radiogenic plus accretion heat uh and put that all into lava, which is a lot more than the 10% that it does on earth. And then assume that's profusively cracked and you make hydrogen byzation from that what's that up in that.",
