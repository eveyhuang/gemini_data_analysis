So something that a change that occurs but actually enables it to be positive, more positive to the growth, to a rate constant, to a positive feedback. Could that be one of the major transitions as well where it's not always derailing the system as we often see in synthetic chemistry.

And so I was thinking and this could be framed in those terms too, are there jumps that could happen in the functionality of a pre life or prebiotic chemical system that can occur if you have reaction networks that optimize in specific condition spaces or environments, but then are brought together for the first time and or each system that was optimized to its condition space, then the conditions change a bit like Andro was saying. And could you then could that lead you to a boundary that then you go you push to a new state with the system. And could that be something that is the rarity of origin of life where you can get a far a long way in certain chemical systems, but until you combine it with other ones in different conditions, you can never really get past that point. And then my other question was to for catalysis, let's say like enzyme type redox reactions, to improve catalytic function of a reaction, um, to what extent can the catalytic activity of inorganic substrates like iron sulfur clusters be enhanced by the creation of of geologically driven organics to a point, but then where's the limit of that and to what extent do you require an inheritance system to be able to reproduce the same type of catalyst or protein and how far can you get without having a reproducible organic ligand let's say around that cluster.",

            "transcript": "Sure. Um, my brain is swirling, but I guess just two things. Um, one in response to what Greg was saying, I don't know if this is what you're thinking about, but I used to spend a lot of time thinking about these evolutionary dead ends and how it is that these early replicating networks or these self replicating molecules actually continue to evolve towards greater complexity as opposed to being streamlined to just being really good, really fast replicators. So maybe some of you've heard of a Spiegelman's monster where if you have replicators in test tubes and optimize them over time, you end up with leaner and meaner replicators, but they don't increase in complexity or functionality and I used to wrestle with this a lot, but one thing that people often would say is, well, the environment matters, right? And so the dynamism of an environment can can select for greater functionality over time. So that's something that I kind of mull over. Um, the other thing I was thinking about, I think might be related to what Betul first mentioned, which is this question of at least for me, how do we link natural selection with energy acquisition? Like I I've read a lot of papers about again, self replicating networks, hypercycles, um autocatalytic cycles, how we would get selection in these early stages. And then I've read a lot about proton gradients and harnessing energy across membranes and so on. And what I have yet to make the connection of in my mind is how you bring these two together and is it in the form of an early protocell, is it in, you know, sort of just like limitation on a mineral surface? How do we how do we bring those two things together and and maybe for me too is what methods do we need to use to answer those questions? Because I think that, you know, I use the tools of bioinformatics, so I'm doing very top down work with genomics, but I don't think that at least for my work, I don't think we can get that far. So it might be up to the experimentalist like Laurie to, you know, make your events in the lab and and you know, and create these things and and tell us how that could work and then we could see if we see something similar in the genomic record, but I struggle with this the meeting of the top down and bottom up approaches, so those are just things on my mind.",

So there we're missing something key here, I think that why haven't we quite made this transition in the lab yet. Of course you can always argue that we're not as good as chemists as nature, but I feel like there are some parameters missing. So I guess my point is that what are we missing and what kind of experiments can we design um to to test this transition. that's that's really I think something that maybe we can if if anyone's interested, I'm very interested in brainstorming about this.",

I you know, I I'm an I'm an analytical chemist and I'm always thinking about how can we measure something? And when we talk about this kind of continuum or spectrum between life and non life, I mean, do we I'm trying to think of ways like ways to actually differentiate something in the middle versus something that's alive versus not alive. You know, something that's kind of on that path but maybe not there yet. And I think that's really difficult. I mean, you know, just I'm I'm a chemist and you know, thinking of when you when you throw in these really complex systems, right? the analytical tools that I'm familiar with, it's hard to actually capture that system interaction experimentally, right? You know, like so I'm I'm a mass spectrometrist for instance, right? And you know, people do mass spectrometry of cells and things all the time, right? And what they do is they, you know, they lice the cells and they look at the lipids, they look at the metabolites or they um, you know, they digest the proteins and the peptides and look at those, but you can't really see those molecular interactions through mass spectrometry, right? And so, you know, people have to do things like where they um tag molecules and look at like fluorescence microscopy or you know, things I mean, I'm I'm just my head is thinking about how do we how do we actually see something that's in in the middle. And I think that's really hard and maybe that's part of the reason why there's I mean there is kind of some gap I mean there's a lot of gap there. I like I I remember Greg I I heard you give a talk once about kind of your your work kind of thinking about that the space between that, right? And um yeah, I I I I feel like even even if we had a system present that was kind of in the in that space, could we really tell? I don't know I don't I don't know the answer to that question. You know, that that's that's kind of what's on my mind and I don't I don't mean to like transition the conversation away from where we are, but that that's what I'm thinking about, yeah.",

And then suddenly you just get two main peaks because it's kind of cutting off those other side reactions. And so sometimes it's clearly abiotic because you're just getting the small molecules or something, but a lot of times it it's not and the geochemical conditions can fine tune the distribution that you see. So it's less about product identification and more about distribution of organics, which has been talked about in astrobiology for a long time, but the abiotic distributions are highly variable and also pretty specific looking depending what you do.",

You know, for example, if you make this, you know, if you have these monomers and they just shoots to a polymer and then the polymer just stays there, it does it's probably not going to do anything, right? And you know, I'm thinking of you know, like when like when we do like I do a lot of reactions in wet wet dry cycling, right? And part of the power of that is actually in the wet phase is hydrolysis, so water breaking down like some of the polymers back into monomers and shorter sequences. And you know, that that kind of that breaking aspect is actually a really critical part of that process. And you know, like I I almost don't want a reaction that's like too good, you know, like there's almost like a balance there, right? And so I I I I agree with what you're saying but I I think the word robustness can almost like you almost don't want it to be like overly robust, right? else you're just going to accumulate a lot of stuff that's not going to do anything.

So um it's it's making me think of the conversations that I've been prebiotic chemistry like 10 years ago, like Shelley Copley published some papers about how we need sparsity in our chemical networks and how we need to have very targeted outcomes. But then there was this discussion of messy chemistry and that's it seemed to me as an outsider like the opposite. And it almost seems like for both prebiotic chemistry and for selection, you need to have somewhere in the middle. You need to have the right amount of variation, the right amount of messiness, but it can't be so messy that you end up with tar, you know, as Steve Benner likes to say. So it's like for both for both the prebiotic chemistry part of it and then later as you're getting to these replicating networks, you need to have some happy medium between the messiness and the and the sparsity.",

But biology like you said, would take them along a certain, we were talking about this in the last meeting, along a very certain path. So there would be a very distinct way to to to monitor a sample of of some sort of organism, whatever it is, but looking at that chemistry is going to be very conservative, presumably, even if it is eating feeding off the environment of more complex organic compounds.

So you probably have thought very deeply about um different types of measurements um within the context like of a suite of instruments that you would put on a mission. So do you want to say a couple things about that? Sure. So I mean, I kind of think of in some ways origin of life and the mission thought process is a little bit similar because with origin of life you you conceptually break life down into its components and then you got to come up with some way for each of those to to exist without life in order for it to be life because if you define origin of life as say life without RNA, well then, you know, what? So like you basically have to kind of take each part and have abiotic ways and then all together it is life and that's your origin.",

So it's things like, you know, do we have organic molecules? What kind are they? Carbon isotopes. People look at things like cell motility or imaging. There's atmospheric detection of things that we think are just made by life and it just kind of depends on what your spacecraft constraints are and there's all sorts of technical problems here. But basically it is in some ways similar because if you detect let's say a carbon molecule or molecules or a distribution or a functionality like an autocatalytic reaction or something like that together is it life?

I think it's important because I I also you know, hearing this sort of looking at the size of the molecules or even the complexity of the molecule that's generated, that alone is not quite an indicator. You can argue that an elephant and an ant has the same complexity. In fact, I think ants are more complex than an elephant. So you know, generation of big molecules or the size themselves are not indicators, but it's more almost about the generation of some sort of persistent behavior um that that is that is present in whatever the locality that is being screened. So from a mission perspective, I don't know how feasible it is to stay put in in in one place and and then just thoroughly analyze what happens over time because you obviously want to see some presence that is again persistent over time.

I don't personally, I don't think the goal should be look for life elsewhere. I think it should be characterize organic chemical states of planets and understand what life is.

What they how they estimate error is like they'll they'll flip the sequences in their database and they'll see how many hits they get and they compare that to what they do it when it's going forward, right? And so um in they just call like a false discovery rate, you know, and and I I think as obviously we're like you said, we're not really at a point where we can like quanti like quantitate like how confident are we that this is life or this is potential life or things like that. But that's something that we'll have to think about in the future is as, you know, maybe in 30 years maybe we can be more quantitative about that. Um and as as as we can have like a kind of like a quantitative or positive, we'll have to quantitate an error as well. And um I think I I think there are potential ways to do that like on an experimental basis, but um it's just something that we'll have to keep in the back of our mind. But I agree.

Um, and some of those spectral characteristics are the same spectral characteristics that we see of um uh lake associated sediments. Sediments that you see at the bottom of dry lake beds. So on the earth actually, uh like right behind me, the white things that you see kind of on the surface are um sabka uh deposits left behind on these kind of like ephemeral lakes, little playas that are in between these mega mega dunes. Um, so I think it's totally possible that we could see some um uh liquid associated sediments um in the uh interdunes um, and especially if we happen to come across a river or something like that, something that's been mobilized, um, but we aren't directly going to any of the known lakes.",
