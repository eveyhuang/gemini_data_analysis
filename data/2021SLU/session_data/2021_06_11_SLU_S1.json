And so I imagine Earth as like a different planet every time you look at it throughout its history because a lot of things have changed. And so I think we have all these ideas of what bio signatures are for Earth today, but we know that life was on Earth for at least three and a half billion years or so. And so from a bio signatures perspective, if you applied all these techniques to Earth, at what point in Earth's history would you detect life for real with each of these techniques and those might all change things like the atmospheric detections of oxygen or the isotopes or the organic molecules in samples. And so it's a lot of times an origin of life there's this idea that once you have the tipping from the prebiotic world to the biotic world it just takes over and spreads rapidly because it's so good at evolution. And so that may or may not be true, but if it is, then even so you'd have this prebiotic or this completely biotic world for some time before things like atmospheric oxygen would even manifest.",

But um basically there are molecular mechanisms that can, you know, get rid of excess light. So the the plant basically changes some confirmations of proteins and pushes things around so that we it doesn't get scorched. So so if it's too bright, it can actually down regulate and it emits that light or or or finds other ways to remove that that energy. And so it's a very active mechanism, right? It's it's a mechanism that is not just driven by chemical gradients or energetic gradients like you would expect through chemical processes, it's basically an active feedback mechanism. So, you know, you can I I in my head I would delineate that, you know, rocks and and maybe geological motion, things that are really moving, they're kind of driven by some basic kinetics. There's no system that says, oh wait, if the if if this happens then feed back and do something differently. You know, naturally we sometimes see that, but it's pretty rare. And so I would say that one it's it's really an idea. I don't know if this is true, but you could argue that things that develop a feedback mechanism could in principle be classified as differently than things that don't develop feedback mechanisms in their processes, right? And so photosynthesis is one example, but many of the things, right? We, you know, genetics evolving life tends to regulate their the DNA so that the you know when you create the next uh generation, you have some level of repeating structure that's that's very precisely regulated in a lot of ways.",

I mean obviously if you think of what is what right now just stay staying on earth for a minute, what is the what is a a signal of of life regulating the seasonal CO2 signal is is something that is entirely the result of of terrestrial of, you know, of of photosynthesis of of um the carbon and oxygen cycle. But the what I was saying more from the other way to think about broader questions of just of stability and regulation, you can pose questions looking at Earth's record. So is when we had when we had oxygenic photosynthesis, does this lead does this lead to greater stability in the oxygen cycle? You can test models from the rock record that say that once you have oxygenic photosynthesis, it's irreversible oxygenation is irreversible or not. And there there are still wildly different views on that whether life stabilizes or destabilizes a planet.",

Getting them to the moon and potentially getting them to Mars. And it really makes me wonder if you could piggy back on these missions to basically build instruments that were had a much quicker turnaround, were not nearly as capable as these big missions, but when combined, you could perhaps do something like interferometrically that would allow you to observe in a very different way. So I I actually as an outsider, I was wondering, you know, given the current emphasis in getting people on the moon again, you could imagine instrumentation on the moon that is basically doing some sort of combined effort astronomy where it's not so focused and siloed. Um, I don't know if that's feasible from, you know, the perspective of your funding and how that would ever happen, but it seems like an opportunity, right? There's this kind of effort for commercialization of space travel. So maybe you could take advantage of that in the short term.",

So, um, to me as someone who doesn't know much about the technological capabilities, like I think there's two for me like what I see are the ways in which maybe life can impart the signature would either be like a temporal, you know, some sort of like rate change that might be noticeable or you know, better spatial resolution where you might be able to see spatial gradients on a planet, maybe that might reflect life versus biogenic biogenic versus abiotic processes. So I think to me that's what I was wondering about is if if either of those are in the in the future of our of our technological advances, maybe that would be one way to to think more about like the spatial or time gradients that life can impart.",

They can be they're going to be entire they're the flux from from a protite is going to be dramatically different than the flux from any other any other material.

Um, the the the pigments, um, you know, I mean, we're talking about and Nikki knows this, um, well is um, we're looking, you know, the the the most observable consequences of the pigments are the edges, are the spectral edges where you have, for example, the vegetation red edge, you have the the contrast between, you know, the red 700 nanometer wavelengths and then the the very near infrared wavelengths where where vegetation or other photosynthesizers become very um reflective and that may be different depending on where the absorption peaks are. But you need the contrast, so you need part of the organism to be bright, um, not just part of it to be absorptive. And that's why, you know, thinking about pigments in water, um, water's very dark, um, and so they need to be near the surface to create the reflectance. So really what you're looking for are the spectral breaks and then the question becomes are those spectral breaks indicative of biology or are they from some mineral um that also has band gaps and and spectral breaks. And of course, we have libraries of those. So we'd have some kind of matching way of doing that. And I think Nikki probably has some thoughts about um, you know, um, you know, the the kind of ecological case of looking for multiple spectral breaks that may then um, you know, indicate multiple photosynthesizers in different environments. But certainly if you could then map those pigments to say uh on based on longitude and they were say collocated with where you're seeing the continents or collocated where you're seeing the continental margins, maybe that, you know, is a really strong biosignature.",

Um, you know, plants tend to be reflective in those windows where the atmosphere is absorptive. So is there a way to kind of combine that information also as Eddie said kind of spatially, but you know, normally you these two things kind of uh anti correlate. So if you know the atmosphere and you say it's basically has some transmission windows here, here, here and here, then you might look for high reflectivity in those windows and that might suggest that things have basically adapted to to grow inside those windows, right? So if you are able to delineate those, that would be a really powerful tool, but I don't know if observationally you can do that because you're just looking at light coming back, you know, you don't you don't know whether it's transmission or or reflection or maybe you do.",

We were talking about it in the gather session last night. Um yes, chlorophyll A has been demonstrated to absorb in an atmospheric window and it's, you know, where the maximum photon flux is from our star at the surface of the planet. But that actually doesn't hold up for bacteriochlorophylls. Some of them sit right under underwater bands. So as a general rule, that that may or may not really apply um to exoplanets. And so, and I think that you even brought it up earlier, the thing to keep in mind with phototrophic organisms is that um sometimes they're choking on the light. They get too much light and they can be actually photoinhibited.",

It's kind of you have this kind of visible to near infrared kind of opening and there's obviously some change, you know, there's different things across there. But could you argue that all of photosynthesis that we know of lies within that basically visible to near infrared, right? So so at least on a broad scale, maybe not, you know, there's obviously subtle details and there's like some complications, but if you, you know, if you just look at it at a broad scale, you would say I I think that that it it it reason what it does is I I guess I I I am in my head correlating, you know, I have a black body spectrum from the sun.",

Um, then we would know that, you know, some component of the longitude is at, you know, different different latitudes. So maybe that is gettable at, but I I don't know if anybody's actually looked into that. I know we we could talk to Nick. I know Nick and um Joel uh Schwartz, I think, were working on how much information we could pull out of these sorts of things, but but that's another potential, you know, I think project is to, you know, how how well could we pull out those sorts of static latitudinal changes that are due to seasonal variations and say vegetation or some other mechanism.",
