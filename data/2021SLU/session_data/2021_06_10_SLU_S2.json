This is true for like the NASA RCNs, exobiology and everything else. And then we have all these planetary science questions about other worlds and life on other worlds, but there is no funding that I've ever found where you could study the possible origin of life on another world in a non-earthlike manner. And so that's that's been a real problem for someone who's interested in life detection like me because, you know, I want to say, well, on Mars for example, could you have life begin in some other way than earth, but you can't really do those experiments. And I think that's a real like issue in in linking these two things. So that's kind of a general thought. And then as far as uh go ahead.",

But I also wonder, you know, there could just be main similarities between life here and life on exoplanets, but the but the origin of life was actually different than it was on earth and maybe the initial steps of chemical evolution were different. So it could be carbon based, it could be in water, but it's still not the same as earth. And so there's a lot of experiments that could be done, even big things early on like minerals direct reactions, but how exactly and which minerals are prevalent. And you know, you could imagine like I think on early earth, the redox state of the planet was a huge factor because you have let's say iron two very rich in the oceans and an atmosphere of mostly CO2. And what is the redox state of the atmosphere? What is the redox state of the mantle? Like these are huge drivers for what sort of reactions you might have even with all the same chemicals that we are used to. And so that's the sort of stuff that I think would deserve more experimental investigation that kind of hasn't been done.",

You know, under specific conditions. And the second question is how stable those molecules can be, right? Maybe the cells protiles, you know, maybe uh over like millions of years for for example. I think there are two processes and it could be like competing process as well, right? Maybe like they're forming the organics, but they're also degrading at the same time. Um, I I think also, you know, it's very important like Laurie says, the modeling is very important because for the experimental studies, uh we can only conduct maybe like months or maybe years, but uh it's not, you know, long enough to really predict what's going on, right? In the geologic time. Uh I think for the geochemist, we we have some models that can predict what is going to happen at equilibrium um states, but uh um but the time scale actually, I think it's a big question mark there.

And also the modeling would tell us stability of a product at a condition, but it didn't take into account the instability of the molecule, like we were talking about. And so there was nowhere in the model to input the fact that like this molecule degrades at a well known exponential curve that we see in the lab, but that's not included in the model.

I I'm not sure which method they are using to determine the temperature of exoplanets. But by my point even for the planets in our solar system, even for the planets and moons in our solar system, we don't have determine very well the surface temperature. You know, because so uh of course we have some in situ measurements for the mass surface temperature, but if you check the global, I mean global scale temperature, that's other problem. So that's mean what's the radiation budget on the top, what's the radiation transfer inside of atmosphere, then what's the precisely what's the temperature on the surface. I I mean and global scale. That's actually even for Mars, we don't have very good very good knowledge for that. Of course the for the same thing for the Venus, for the Titan, you know for maybe for yeah. So I mean if we if we can figure out one one way to better determine the surface temperature of exoplanets. That I mean it will help help us to find life help us to find liquid water and life and so on.

And then the chemists could make which parameters are most effective in changing the way a chemical reaction turns out, because you know, certain ones you change in the lab it is not that big of a deal. Other ones you change it, it changes everything. And where that overlap is could be, you know, a shorter list where we could focus in the lab.
