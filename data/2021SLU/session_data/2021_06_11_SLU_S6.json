You know, there's been all this controversy in the literature whether Jupiter does it protect Earth from impacts, does it actually increase the rate of impacts on Earth? Is that a good thing? Is it driving volatile rich material during late heavy bombardment that in you know, subsequently formed our oceans. Um, and so I think the fact that we don't understand that fully for our own solar system kind of points to this being a hard problem. Uh and I think we at least know in exoplanet systems that we don't want those giant planets to migrate inward and and disrupt the inner system, but I think the details beyond that are really interesting to me.

And so and and I've heard some people I I I feel like it was Greg Laughlin or someone like that at some point at a conference like sort of off the cuff said like maybe this is a condition for getting ending up with habitable planets rather than just like water worlds and that if the planets if the giant planets hadn't migrated around the way they did, then we would have ended up with much more volatile rich terrestrial planets or something along those lines. Um, and so yeah, I guess the question is, you know, can you can you use like a giant planet a few AU as a sign post that there's going to be a potentially habitable terrestrial world or more broadly, is there anything useful that you can learn from other planets in a in a system that will tell you something about the potentially habitable worlds there. And I think the examples people usually give like what Paul was saying is like they're like negative things. Like you see a hot Jupiter say, okay, no habitable planets there.",

Um yeah, so I think it would be really interesting to see the presence of giant planets relative to the snow line location at the beginning and how earlier giant planets form in the system and change the impact of the the water content for the inner region. Well you you can also imagine you have a compact system with a bunch of equal roughly equal mass of super earth and how the water content should be different from a planet inside a giant.",

I I think this requires something that well I'm plugging it in. But so something that we're working on now really to try to uh to find a a new way um it's it's pretty straightforward actually, but any way to try to uh to generalize the Opic method to different um to different configurations and to generalize to general rocks that they can come from wherever and not necessarily from uh you know, the same plane that Jupiter lies.

Um and you ask where it can live, you use the Tiran parameter, I never know how to pronounce it well. So it assumes that the it assumes something about the um the the orbit itself. It assumes where the particle is. It seems that it's in the in the same plane. Um it's the assumes that the orbit is um circular and then from this they um they have this uh uh they generalize to above and below. So you can show actually that the this type of um restricted three body system can you can well, it's not really wave your hands, but you can show that it can work also if you go um to arbitrary inclination, but it has a lot of limitation because the parameter is actually not applicable in arbitrary inclination. So it's kind of a mix and match of I I don't know. I I I I'm I'm I'm confused on why why it was used so much. Um so and then it calculates the probability of collision. So you assume uh uh and also the probability of collision is estimated is just crossing the orbit. But crossing the orbit is not guarantee a collision. I can have a rock crossing the orbit and nothing will happen. So it's overestimating the probability of collision.",

So often people are thinking about um at least in the numerical simulations when they you know, like the tagged in this model, they they assume about the how how how big is, you know, how the water delivery on what you get of water at the end just by counting, you know, things that came beyond the ice line. But then there are these studies like for uh for example from Hilke's Hilke Schlichting's work, they showed that when you have something that explodes in a already formed um an atmosphere, you expel bunch of stuff um and not necessarily gain. So I wonder if this is at the time of the impact, right? So it depends when the impact took place, right? Because Hilke's models really assumes a very well defined atmosphere and a core and maybe when things are still in the mix and start just forming, then you get the water delivery and after that you expel because you heat up the planet then you expel water or you evaporate whatever it is there. Um so then it's also interesting to think about this in the context of a giant planet where whether or not it will shield us or or shield the planet, not necessarily just us. Um or will not help us, right? I don't know if I was clear. It was like a bunch of things in my head.",
