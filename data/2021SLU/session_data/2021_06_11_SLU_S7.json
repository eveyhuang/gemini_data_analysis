In their paper, they actually um predict that even the biomass is lower than that from the Earth ocean, uh ammonia, even the trace amount of ammonia, we're talking about sub PPM level can be detected by JWC. So this is just one example. So I think my point is that people have studied that. Um, of course, there are a lot of assumptions going into the calculation, but I think from the ballpark it's doable even with the, you know, slightly the, you know, next generation or even the current generation telescope, which is JWC.

Um, so we have a a model that we sort of do sort of what you're describing to um uh and uh and just run the oxygen cycle to steady state and then try and generate statistical distributions of oxygen and and ozone abundances. Um, and you know, for for anything but the simplest models, um, it starts to become uh pretty pretty taxing uh just from a a a time scale perspective, you know, if you want to run an oxygen cycle to steady state and engage crustal reservoirs of organic carbon and reduced sulfur for instance, you know, you're talking about having to run models for uh, you know, billions of years uh for having some of our models don't come to steady state after the main sequence lifetime of a G star. Uh so, so if you want to run you know, many thousands of these or you know, even tens of thousands of these to to get uh a statistical sense, um, that can be um that's a model design problem.",

Um, but I was kind of had been thinking along the lines of um, yeah, that how the volatile reservoirs evolve and how the ratios of volatiles that are in the total inventory of the planet evolve over time due to outgassing, loss due to the stellar magnetic field in the case of an exoplanet, um, and then recycling back into the interior. So through this sort of outgassing and recycling, analogously to IO, which is something I spend a lot of time thinking about, you have this um, through recycling can get uh evolution of the total volatile inventory of the planet and as a result you can change the redox state of the mantle.",

But in the deposits you have other information about what the flow conditions were uh which would be less sensitive to the presence of life. Um like the presence of bars or grain size that that kind of stuff. And so you have a bunch of of pieces that you can put together to constrain the other parameters that could affect bed forms, you can make predictions of what they should look like if there was no life and then compare, you know, what they should look like with what they actually look like and potentially say something about whether um, you know, there was there was life.",

There are parts of cycling that are always completely abiotic. Like there are both biological and abiotic ways to precipitate out um different compounds in the oceans and and bury them or or or or you know mineralize them. There are both biotic and abiotic ways to produce gases that have redox couples. But the only way that you cycle things down from sedimentary rock back into the planet is purely abiotic and that's just subduction or tectonics or something physical and there's no biological way to do that. It's utterly dependent on having those big geological processes in motion. Now is that necessary for life? I have no idea. Um or is it necessary for a biosphere? Uh but I think maybe it's important to make a distinction between processes that are um perhaps only accelerated by biology or facilitated by biology versus processes that are dependent upon um large scale abiotic systems being in place. Like biology can't invent plate tectonics if it's necessary for the continuation of the biosphere.",

So what happens if you have a deep ocean is you have 100 million years of exchange between the uh rock and the water uh while things are hot enough for melting to occur. But then you have solid state mantle convection with no melting and therefore no volcanism just because the weight of the water uh the pressure freezes the rock and so you don't get melting after that. Um but the planet despite the lack of geochemical cycles uh doesn't go unstable. It does warm over time because the sun is brightening and you get ex solution of carbon uh which is a positive feedback uh you get ex uh the warmer ocean can store less carbon. So this this is a positive feedback that warms the planet further but that positive feedback is not strong enough to produce a runaway and therefore the planet can stay habitable for billions of years.",

So if it's not the carbonic acid system that's doing it, um it it might be some other system. But then you start to get into questions of um of pH tolerance of of organisms. So um so so the simp the the the the answer to your question, I think is is no in the sense that, you know, you could imagine other buffering chemistries. But um to the extent that something in the realm of circumneutral, you know, like seven, I don't know, let's say eight plus or minus 1.5 pH units, um to the extent that that's important, then um that actually cuts down on the number of buffering systems that you can uh uh you know, plausibly invoke um just because of the PKs of of uh of the systems. And of course that'll change if if you if you fiddle around with pressure and temperature to some extent, but um so so the carbonic acid system is a um is a is a good one. And and also gives you a ready tie to uh regulation of of CO2 and climate over time in in ways that um uh I mean you you can conceivably do something similar with the sulfuric acid system and SO2. I I think you could probably imagine that, but the pH is in the in the fluids start to become uh uh pretty pretty low.

And it got me to thinking about erosion rates and the role that potentially gravitational tides play on that. Has anybody thought about that in terms of because that paper was talking about like uh topography, right? And relief. But if you've got really strong gravitational tides, like the moon's closer in, you have these big tides, won't that compensate a bit for that kind of topographic effect?",
