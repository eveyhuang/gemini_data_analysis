If you think of all the work that's going into siting wind farms, like using the analogy, there are a lot of comparables, but wind farms don't care usually about the humidity. And I think Rob was saying, can you get these things mobile? Wind farms is pretty easy to change the pitch with the wind. That's not the same as taking the whole thing and shifting it from one location to another.",

Yes, because that also would be a direct capture or in soil.

What if you remove the lower the CO2 concentration around these natural sinks, wetlands, ocean, because at the end of day, this whole technology of CCUS is being developed to lower the CO2 concentration in atmosphere, right? So that by reducing this local concentration of CO2, would it impact too much? So that in net, we are not doing anything good because some positive, some negative, it wash out. That's what people worrying about, right?",

And we did a base analysis of what happens when where would you site DAC if you had to use just variable renewable power? But one of the questions, and we looked at the California grid, and just based on economics, you can you would choose DAC over alkaline electrolysis. But one of the two open questions that we still have is what are the real costs of these systems and why? Because they're still being developed, we don't we have no idea. And what are the real process process models? So we we don't we have an idea of how they could ramp up and down with with the variability of renewable power, but how does that affect the process, the ramping and the rest of it and degradation.",
