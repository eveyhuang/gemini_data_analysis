So for example, um if you look at CO2 hydrogenation to something like methanol, um you need high pressures um being at sub atmospheric pressures really hurts you in terms of equilibrium conversions. So, um do you there needs to be a significant energy input in the form of pressure to hydrogenate CO2 to something like methanol, right? And you need a source of hydrogen. So, um yeah, those are those are the additional challenges. I'm I'm afraid I'm only pointing out the challenges and not the solutions, but I guess",

Praveen has very good points because uh if you want to make any chemicals and materials and fuels, you need hydrogen because CO2 only have carbon and oxygen. And where that hydrogen coming from make a huge difference in the overall sustainability of technology. And people talk about four different colors now, right? Black, gray, green, blue, hydrogen. And depending on which color you choose, it'll be totally different. And another thing is if you're putting that middle of nowhere, not only you need a CO2 conversion reactor, but you need to also have a hydrogen production reactor right there because you cannot transfer your hydrogen all the way out to ocean or somewhere else. So that's another challenge you have to think about if you want to do conversion to chemicals and fuels other than carbon, you're okay, right? Because you don't need hydrogen.",

And one advantage of that is you can couple it to hydrogen production pretty easily. You can do electrolysis. I mean there's challenges of doing seawater electrolysis, but it's possible and you could directly couple that to carbon capture so you'd have your hydrogen and CO2 pretty still at the same place.",

Uh she put carbon into carbonate ions or bicarbonate ions and she can definitely work with electro chemical people or she can also work with biomass people doing algae growth. So question becomes CO2 which is very ground state, you have to activate, right? It could be CO bicarbonate carbonate or any of these species. How to transfer that to another either catalyst or another system can convert to some even higher energy level. Those are very different question because most of the questions are at the interface people have not thought about. And I think there will be a lot of fundamental questions we have to ask. How to merge biological system with electrochemical system or how to merge the material um chemistry with the catalyst chemistry. So there's a lot of interface areas you have to now start asking questions and it could be quite interesting.",

So it's just again the synergy between these two processes is really challenging, but that's also another option that you can directly to the alcohol farms and just grow algae, right?",

            "transcript": "So, um maybe this is a good opportunity for people to look at the slide and think if it's captured some of the um more relevant questions so that so the the framing that Alyssa posed to actually put into the report out is to consider the modeling without even considering the technology itself and basically kind of treat these like uh a technology that we can describe as a black box and we can install it with some energy and efficiency metrics and some way to account for intermittency. And then uh use that to address some questions that we can we can we can consider that are um uh the same no matter what the actual nature of the technology is. Uh like how do we place them in the field? What is the actual like local distribution of these these these uh in the same vein of a of a wind farm. Um what do we do with the materials that we're the compounds that we're generating in the the process or we like the the example was you could you could make carbon on a nuclear platform in the center of the ocean, but then what do you do with that carbon? Uh do you have to ship it? And then the other thing is the the global and local simulations of environmental impact because there's even when you're doing CO2 removal, you are not doing just CO2 removal. Um you are possibly competing with natural CO2 sinks. You are also possibly generating the parasitic removal of atmospheric oxygen which will will will dry out the local environment. And what uh what when you actually do produce, you know, the the the products of the DAC process, what are the follow-on environmental impacts if you have to put it on a truck and ship it somewhere and you're shipping now low density energy and it's uh being used up to the transportation fuel is high density energy. You are you are uh actually still being a negative uh in terms of CO2 production just because you're making you're capturing CO2 doesn't mean that it's going to end up releasing more in order to move the product of the DAC process. So, uh when I discuss this in the in the group, does this these thoughts pretty much capture what we were discussing here?",
