            "transcript": "constants can play a role. So currently, many people just use simplified computational methods. It may work well for certain materials, but not for all the materials. Some case, in some situations, for example, if you use single metal atoms, then we must include the factors such as surface charge and salvation effects. So I think it's important to develop and use better computation models which can take care of those complex factors into the modeling. Another issue about current modeling method is that they often neglect the kinetics because of the computational complexity. So they often just give you the some dynamics.",
