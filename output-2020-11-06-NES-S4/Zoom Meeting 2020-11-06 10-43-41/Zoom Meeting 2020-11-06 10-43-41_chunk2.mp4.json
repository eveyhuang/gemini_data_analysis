How do you feel about going beyond 100 degrees into higher temperatures, like several hundred degrees C and higher? Does anybody here work in that temperature regime? Do you have experience or insights, or is there a statement you can make like it will never work if, again, Marcel?",

No, what's gonna happen is the following. No, I'm, I'm just, you want to, you want to keep carbon oxide on the surface, right? Because you want it to, you want to make hydrocarbons, right? So you want CO on the surface. But the problem is you have an isotherm. You go hot and push the CO away. And then you, you start having more sites for, for hydrogen generation. And, uh, so then you need to up your pressure. And so I was doing CO2 reduction at 1,500 PSI actually, CO reduction at 1,500 PSI, which then completely changes your mechanistic regime. This is the kind of words, terrible, like, it drove me almost mad. So, just, that's all I'm saying. It's like I've been a little bit around challenges. In that makes things go very, very crazy, very, very quickly. So we know there's a reaction around room temperature, ambient pressure. But as you start moving away from there, I think there's a lot of space to explore. I hope this answers your question.",

            "transcript": "this is a commercial product already on the market doing at elevated temperature. So they have a recent review paper just published in Science, I think, a couple weeks ago. You can read that one. So they have a stable performance over thousand hours. The main product is CO because at high temperature you can't produce any multicarbon product. CO is the only thing you will get. Of course, they have these challenges issues with coke formation and also they have these durability issues. But they already proved they can run thousand hours, right? That's nothing we can complain, say, no temperature can run much longer than that, we don't. So, um, the only difference, I think, between low temperature versus high temperature route is low temperature actually give us opportunity to do more interesting chemistry that you cannot do at high temperature. But high temperature definitely has some unique features there.",

Oh, no, the degradation I'm talking about mostly is related to coke formation, but they also have these electro material also have these durability. Ceramic has these horrible properties. You have to heat up and cool down very slowly, otherwise they, they make cracks. Then you are done. So, uh, we, we actually at one point of time we think about doing these kind of experiment, but we gave up because one experiment just take way longer than if you do low temperature, you probably can do multiple within a day. For high temperature, you barely can do one experiment a day.",
